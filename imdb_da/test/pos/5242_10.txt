I really have nothing to add to all the other comments except this: For me, the movie seemed like a silent movie that was slowly adapted to sound. The text cards bring the story together reinforced the impression I suppose. Along the way, the actors were allowed to leave the stylish, theater-like play; Marguerite Churchill looks very much like a typical timeless sounding heart at the beginning of the movie, but at the end it is finer expression. Gus, the Swede? Reminded me of the comics in Shakespeare plays, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck. It was really amazed at me that everything was filmed outdoors, on the spot and even though dust of all wagons, horses and cattle hides the view, it must have been so for the right settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians must have been real, and I have not discovered any obvious racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As a person who became a true Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy of John Ford, and believed that Stage Coach was Wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation. The reason is very simple, and reminds me of a quiet movie, but the gravel is very right! An amazing film that has been made with the technique and under these conditions in 1930.
