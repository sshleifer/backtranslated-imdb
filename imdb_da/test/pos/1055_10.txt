I came across this movie back in the mid-eighties as a teenager, and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday movies. As you can tell from the other reviews, this movie has a very good story and great actors who are logged on. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as the bride to be having other thoughts. Dennis Morgan's play is also strong. He goes unnoticed in most movies, but was a very talented actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this movie he plays the visiting sailor who woos Stanwyck away from his husband to be. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. The settings and history make it a good Christmas romance
