This neo-film noir is one of a late 20th-century American movie genre, all of which seems to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a highway tire, and, of course, lots of people exercised by people There seems to have never taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night." There is the late, great J.T. Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction" and many more) who made many neo films noirs (See also "Breakdown"). Then there is Michele Forbes from the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide." (In a supportive role, there is even the late Bejamin Lum, who also appeared on a Star Trek episode titled "The Naked Now.") A spoiler of beats - a clue really: Only the innocent survives, but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this and you probably will not guess who is innocent before the final reel.
