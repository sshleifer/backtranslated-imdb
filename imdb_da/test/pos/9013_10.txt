Original Movie lovers can actually love this show if they just stop complaining all the time. Emperor's new school brings some old jokes from the movie, such as pulling the arm to Yzma's lab and Kuzco breaks episode. But since it's a kids show, it's just classical and is in their right places. Although the style is much simpler, the animation and characters keep their personalities very good, and it really surprised me. Eartha Kitt makes excellent voice that works for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the movie. Great plots, hilarious moments and Kuzco's stunning looks make this show worth seeing. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
