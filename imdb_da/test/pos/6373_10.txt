Am glad I am not the only one to find this series very good. This is the best series for young ladies! I have a strange taste of comedies, and I find so hard one to please my intelligence, and I am so happy that their humor is exactly what I need. Love the band of actors! If someone knows a series or just a movie that looks like this, I say beautifully, please write back because I miss the series. <br /> <br /> Ask the authors and producers to continue it even though the actors are now all adults, I think! <br /> <br /> Have a good morning / day / evening / night! (because I don't know the exact time you want to read this post)
