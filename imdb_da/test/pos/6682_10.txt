The always lovely Kevin Spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives. After driving us to believe, he is a mumbling little time offense (only to reveal the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic The Usual Suspect; This time, he leads us to believe that he is Prot, a sympathetic stranger who assumes a human form as he walks around the earth. Prot is a peculiar stranger who has apparently emerged from nothing, only to be admitted to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institution. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon takes extreme interest in him and finds himself contemplating whether Prot is actually the highest creature from the planet K-PAX, or maybe he's just a forgotten person with serious psychiatric problems. While the conclusion can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex and enlightening journey that leaves a great exciting exciting / philosophical question behind it.
