To make just a few movies with his life, the late big Chris Farley. Farley died in late 1997 and will be missed most of his actor in Tommy Boy, David Spade. From Lame Police Academy 4, Spade has really done well with his career in film. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we see it. From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to do Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would look again and again and laugh at the same part every time. Thanks Chris Farley.
