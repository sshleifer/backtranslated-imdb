cool flick. fun to see. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. I like the location setting with all the new york references. It was interesting how it all unfolds in the end. the voltage factor was effective and the action, although kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. There are a bunch of nice little tricks incorporated into this movie that make it better. I think the supporting actress did a good job in his role. Casting and steering in this movie seems to be stitched together smoothly and the quality of shooting is quite impressive. The film is also without its soft moments, giving it a good sense of balance.
