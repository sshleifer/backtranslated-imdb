I am amazed that I have a true love for this one, because I'm not an action and adventure law. But hey ... It's pretty hard to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I have read several bad or temperate reviews on this movie, pulling it apart because it is periodic error or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition showing how a hardened junk (Carlyle) turns to a fairly noble, selfless heroes, and how the beautiful boy, celebrating vagrant (Miller) develops a true taste for a highway man when he "makes it work". Filled with lots of bad boy humor, lavish scenes (especially the use of "fireworks" by former apothacary Plunkett) and a charming ecclectic musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a fast and very enjoyable piece of film making. It is definitely worth seeing the viewing time FOR CLIMAX SCENE ALONE! Shoot them, boys!
