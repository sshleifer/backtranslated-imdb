Non-native no-brainer comedy, where comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as a discontinued doctor deeply involved in his research. When he has his experimental formula, he is transformed into the naturally devouring Hyde, which does not cause any problems to anyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this. It has a really crazy, madcap approach; It is full steam ahead with an outrageously stupid yet undeniable fun joke after another. Fun lines and synagogues are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for everything it is worth. A highlight has Hyde jumping into the song; "Hyde has nothing to do with Hyde" is pretty catchy and even now I can still hear it in my head. The Climax even goes as far as falsifying old b & w horror movies. <br /> <br /> The support boost is also very tense, with Bess Armstrong as ditzy fiance Mary, Krista Errickson as the spunky Ivy and Tim Thomerson as flamboyant fellow Knute Lanyon. I wish more could have been done with Thomerson's character as I am a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A large selection of well-known faces mated before camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a cameo like himself. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow, intelligent comedy, you can better avoid this at all costs. But for those who enjoy a very politically incorrect, happy raunchy good time, this can just do it. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits is saved for last. <br /> <br /> 8/10
