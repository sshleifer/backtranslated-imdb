Just saw 'The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse' at a special screening in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and the Reece Shearsmith of League present. <br /> <br /> On the back was Peter Kay (who has a short como in the movie) affectionate on his back during the Q&A session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was complicated (in a good way) and very much fun. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Mr. Lipp as they try to save fictional Rosyton Vasey from their creators' disinterestedness. <br /> <br /> The league plays a wide variety of their characters and themselves (or character based on themselves) and is strongly supported by the cream of British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner . <br /> <br /> Warner is a particular stand out to remind me of his slick and slick ride in 'Time' Bandits. <br /> <br /> The movie swims in and out of different realities and allows some of Rosyton Vasey's denisees some space to grow beyond their usual limits to their comedy shtick. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Mr. Lipp has a great British moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life that brings a lump to his throat in an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tenderness love for the characters. <br /> <br /> This echo of Mark and Reece said in Q&A afterwards that the plot of the league is tired of their famous characters is false and that the whole movie is really a love letter to them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started as a radio character-based sketch show, these guys have really developed the idea as far as maintaining a movie that takes you on a journey through fiction, "reality" comedy, tragedy and a comfortable journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long-form story from their 70 odd existing creations. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show will love it. It pays dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated may be a little lost, but the joy of the LoG was always the ability to tune into their acute observed characters almost instantly and take the stylistic leap in farce and expressionist film greeting. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to pay tribute to this, including "The Shining" and "La Belle et la Bete" to name two I spotted and they show their love of cinema and history with a segment in 1690's England, which makes perfect sense when you are involved in the movie. What can I say, I wondered, boggled, felt and sneaked all the way through, and they've certainly pulled off what many have failed. A successful British television comedy for cinema translation. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed 'The Gentlemen League' before, take what you want. <br /> <br /> If you don't, rent / buy a DVD and then watch it. <br /> <br /> Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Questions & Answers.
