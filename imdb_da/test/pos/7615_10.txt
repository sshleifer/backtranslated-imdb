I saw it when it first came out and has seen it several times since. I have the DVD. It is one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Not being popular in high school was one thing in the movie I could relate to. I wasn't quite as tortured as Josie was (during her real high school days) or as Aldys, but I wasn't the biggest party type either. The prom scene was the three popular girls who became victims of their own prank when Josie pushed Aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and I clapped when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> I can still see this movie today. it is excellent.
