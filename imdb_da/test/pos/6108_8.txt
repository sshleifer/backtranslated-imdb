Pink Flamingos: A Representation of Society's Past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a movie directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very worrying portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood may have on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very unusual home. Blatantly, you can see what influence this had on society through her actions until the end, where she engages in dog sledging. Was this movie just some sick and winding perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? Aside with the first one would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter may seem demented but possibly true. The film has some credible resemblance to actual events in our societal past. Every leader, like us as people, looks "awful" shows similar characteristics to Babs Johnson. Ivan The Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Staling all had "worrying" childhoods. Babs Johnson had a disturbing childhood and is therefore connected in the same class as all the previously mentioned lines. Therefore, much of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing. But her actions were her own fault or community to let her grow up as she did. In addition, each character in this movie represents either a former leader or event. Another case is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, this can be linked to the genocide and Hitler's attempt to destroy the Jews. Some see Hitler as a genius, others are a sour man. John Waters must have seen him as a sour man because his representation Edith was actually mentally ill. Edith's son Crackers and travel company Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are snake terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget. Theses signs are crucial in pointing out that our society in America sometimes was not better than what we often see as terrible acts of social attacks in other cultures. The chicken f ** king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society during this time period and is still wrong. Chicken, is a 1970s slang term for woman. Therefore, it might be possible that John Waters attempted to bring rape issues through Cotton and Cracker's actions. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was marble. Marble is often mentioned in connection with wealth. Therefore, this can be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the rich a struggle that continues today and will probably continue on forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes, but should also be noted for its disguised political agenda that Waters proved so successful throughout.
