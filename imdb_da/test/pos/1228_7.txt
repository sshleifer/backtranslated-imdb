I'm not here to tell you "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nix. Reference directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). These two helmets did not cheat with niceties as putting women in their movies. No skirts should apply. They made unapologetic quizzes. Guns, lots of weapons. Men met violent death with a jaw in the jaw. Their movie was like a juice to the head. Want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is such a movie. Dueling Armored Trucks? Bloody shots wound Exploding money? If it doesn't make the eye part of your brain look forward, stay away. <br /> <br /> In 88 minutes, "Armored" is all the muscles without an ounce of fat. We meet six security guards who run armored trucks, three per. Truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, arrange a fake hijacking with two trucks. Their mission one day is to deliver $ 42 million from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, stash cash, then step a cut. Of course, the police will suspect them, but if they stick together, they come through it. <br /> <br /> The problem is that one of the six played by Columbus Short is a holdout. Initially, however, he is faced with eviction. And he is the guardian of his shaken little brother. He needs cash badly. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajoles, wont, persuade holdout. No blood on everyone's hands. A clean escape. All good, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue sky smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. It's a damn thing after another, and the effort continues to go up. And it's almost all claustrophobic in an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film goes out of its way to present a background for industrial urban decay. I'm random as an industrial city fall. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Matt Dillon who plays the best evil dog. He goes from charming to disappointed to be frustrated with being furious at being completely insane during the film. Love that guy. Also the credit is due to the threatening, throbbing, blistering and utterly eerie electronic soundtrack by John Murphy. I guess he heard a couple of Tangerine Dream records. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that this is a PG-13 movie. I caught one ?? one! ?? F-bomb throughout this movie about violent robbers. At some level I like it. Take the kids. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a fine noir in the Budapest metro system called "Control." Screenwriter is an out-of-nowhere guy named James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many people in this movie have just started. I am willing to bet that the attention given to this movie will increase as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers.
