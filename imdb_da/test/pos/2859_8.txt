Neil LaBute takes a dramatic trip from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this fun and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) testifies to the brutal murder of his non-good man (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre form of amnesia and flies in her car, without knowing that there is a huge shot of drugs in the baggage . Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is chasing beyond a new beginning (though she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell Greg Kinnear. Only problem: Dr. David is not really, he is a soap opera character on the show "A reason for love" and he is really a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say more about what evolves would be too much, but the nurse Betty is definitely original. Its hit men, like the initiated killings of Pulp Fiction, are violent but philosophical. It takes soap operas that are great spoof material, and its play is the best at all. This must be one of the best cast movies in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Betty's nurse, with the constant shine of the eye pushing her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a murderer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock is his partner, a rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is on his cartoon best as the unsuccessful actor / soap operator. There are also good supporting performances by actors such as the Emmy winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). In fact, the offensive cast is a Who's Who of the best television actors on television. <br /> <br /> A unique movie that is fun for a moment and chills the next, Nurse Betty is a blend of great actor, casting and a fantastic script.
