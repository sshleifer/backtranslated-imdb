For me, this is another of the movies I got to watch out of the Los Angeles-based "Z" Channel when it was in use. And that was another of the movies I saw when I was young ... and learned that there was a world out there ... one I didn't want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and getting to see international cinema became completely my culprit hobby and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the "Z" Channel in its display of international movies. The three international films stuck in my young head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course this, "Pixote". <br /> <br /> This was the most shocking and sadest movie I've ever seen in my life. This was also one of the first films that made me understand that there is a difference in the cinema: entertaining and informing. Let me be honest. I grew up in a small town on the east coast. I had no idea anything like this - to the extent that existed. All I knew from South America was brochures of amazing Brazillian vacations and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Adamant. Daunting. You see: Children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding, and all of these sheep are a way to survive day by day through drugs, sex, stealing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group houses, etc. Their survival is hard to see in other street children , prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how things like this can be allowed to happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not a movie for entertainment, it's a movie of information. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows the lives of these daily street children.
