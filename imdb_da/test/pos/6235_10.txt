Let me just start by saying that the Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror movies that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you don't believe me, see Darkness Falls or You. And it's probably better than any of these crappy directly to video releases like Staff, Bleed, The Pool, and so on. One of the big problems with the movie Tourist Trap is that there has never been an audience found. When the film opened in 1979, it received a PG rating from MPAA. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a PG on a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for the movie. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track.) There are exceptions, however, like Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist, nor produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to ensure Poltergeist success. (Even for those of you who have seen the Tourist Trap, you will even scratch your head on why MPAA has rated this movie PG. The "Heart Burst" scene alone should be enough for the movie to be merged with R-rating. with the tube in the back where the blood runs out of it.) I must admit that even when I was young, I looked at a copy of Poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up so that it was rated PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of an R-rated movie instead. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and understood what a great movie I missed, not to hire a PG horror movie. From then on I would never judge a movie based on that rating again. It is most likely what happened to the Tourist Trap. People like me with Poltergeist will probably overlook it for the benefit of the R-rated movie. It will probably also be a teenager, as most of these types of movies are targeted. Friday the 13th was also no masterpiece, but it did extremely well at the cashier office because of the fact that it was classified R and was strongly advertised by Paramount at the time. It found the audience and made enough money to spawn more successors. When you look at it, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same could have happened with Tourist Trap. We could have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As far as the film goes, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror movie made on an extremely small budget, but it is well-acted, well-directed and well-made on many levels. Chuck Connors is a rebellion like Mr. The Slaus and the best performance in the movie. Special credit must give to composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this movie really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. The music in the scenes involving mannequins is especially unsafe. Donaggio worked on the horror movie Carrie and many other movie results since the Tourist Trap. He has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score movies for this day. The weakness of the Tourist Trap is that there is really no explanation for Davey's powers. Maybe it's the way it should be. He only has them and we should accept it for the movie to work. We accept it to a point, but then the script has events like how Davey makes the phone ring in the store while he is in the basement of the house. If so, is Davey limited to using his powers? Can he call a phone in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his reach? These are things that people who do not care about this movie are likely to point out as errors. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There aren't enough of the kinds of questions generated by this movie to make me hate it. This is a horror movie. We should not be obliged to read too much into it. Many people have called this 'killer mannequin' movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. Mannequins are controlled by Davey's power, which uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with mannequins and some have even said they're just pretty stupid. I think they add the film's overall fragility. Overall Tourist Trap is a great fun rental. *** (out of 5)
