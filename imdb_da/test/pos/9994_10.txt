I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So why ... what is a good sport flic ... this one. And the narrative style is very good. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a reliable great 2 hour entertainment, "Greatest Game" qualifies a lot. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton has gone to the same executive school as Ron Howard - a.c. Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". That is not bad. Look at the huge body of fine work that Ron did after moving behind the camera. Bill as Ron was a great actor, but will be a superstar director whose "Greatest Game Ever" is an indication of things to follow. <br /> <br /> Wonderful cinematography - great direction - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. <br /> <br /> This is a must see movie not just as "feel-good" or "movie", this is a very good movie theater.
