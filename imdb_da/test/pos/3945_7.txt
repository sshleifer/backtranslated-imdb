Another goes around with the monkey who goes west .... kind of. Beginning in the middle of an action, the movie just goes from the first frame forward. <br /> <br /> A monk and his three disciples go to a city to get the sacred sores who will bring peace to the world when translated and spoken to the world. But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all the city's children. The evil force wants the monk, because if you eat him, you will live forever. The containers fight the forces of darkness before they disappear the monk for security (the monk believes he can win just by discussing with the evil ones). The monk ends up with a bunch of lizard, who is planning to eat him at some point ... but the evil guys come and he is out of an odyssey with the ugliest of the party. <br /> <br /> Can a movie start From the rails, the rails go off? Don't make me wrong, I really liked this movie, but its so scatter shot and everywhere the place that plot and logic simply falls away as some scenes simply pick up mid-action with no way of knowing how we got there (The final struggle for rescue the disciples are completely out of the left field). This is one of the dirtiest movies I've seen for a while, but it made me laugh and smile like no one came out. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and so what's on the screen is interesting or fun and you just go with it. How do we get from things to things is often outside of me. Its full of odd exceptions and strange references as we go from heaven to sea to the space of the ribs of some mythical animals that God knows where. This movie floats everywhere, which helps keep it fun as you don't know where it will end (and that's why keeping details at least) And it's fun. Very fun at times. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, although a good deal of it is unnoticed CGI animation (which gives some cool pictures, the golden staff, spider attacks, the angel in flight ...) And it's a lot of touch . Action and comedy aside This is actually a wonderful love story. It's the story of an ugly imp and a monk who ends up falling in love (and has other complications). It is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love. You will be moved. <br /> <br /> But much I enjoyed it, I was still annoyed by its scatter shot construction. The film's inability to keep his ideas together and to tell a complete story really hurts the movie and takes away from the enjoyment every time we get into a bump in the road. The bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much will be cribbed from other sources. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing as it has many choices, just be prepared for some bumps and you will feel good.
