In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb bulletin board when a user wondered if the best years in our life were a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** For me, this movie looks like like opening up a time capsule. I believe in many ways "The Best Years in Our Life" is probably one of the more fascinating character studies, and it looks very good as a look at life in the United States in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both released in 1978, were the latest films closest to catching the many troubles of military men returning from war brought on by "the best years of our lives". <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many, if not all, college students applauded at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie still packs a wallop and I am very happy to read in other posts other users feeling a movie that definitely stands the time test. ***** <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, even though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, it is a wonderful life, and the best years in our life's Oscar win, including best picture, were very well-deserved. <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie again in 2005, and after nearly 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted film.
