I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out and it has been with me for 35 years ago. When the movie came out, all theaters distributed in St. The Louis area as a "lure" a pack of flower seeds that had the film name etc. on the front. On the back of the package it reads in so many words .... plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are rescued ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven year old child I did not plant the seeds for fear of what might come up. Here's the spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving around in dirt. On a small road, a family goes from the city and suddenly the camera returns to the tank and it is full size. It rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs sticking out of the wreck, so suddenly the thought is small again. The reason why this movie stuck with me for so long was because I had an exact toy tank like that in the movie !!!! Unfortunately I do not know what happened to it, but I have kept a cautious eye on the thing ever since !!! <br /> <br /> Turn the lights off, put in the DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. That is really good!!!
