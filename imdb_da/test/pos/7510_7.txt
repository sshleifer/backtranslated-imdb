The hospital is a film made before its time. This film, produced by writer Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning movie "Network", deals with overtime, gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption in a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in an outstanding performance as chief physician, is driven by alcoholism and a death as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and most of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence prevail over care and healing of the sick and injured. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott makes the film his own, and viewers are shocked by what they see in this medical business. You can feel the "pain" (pun) what this hospital has done for him. The live images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you can find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from stage to stage. <br /> <br /> If only the movie had remained with the premise of a documentary style as it starts, this image would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a signature by Scott that falls to the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has murdered people in the hospital. This is where the image's credibility becomes strained. The romantic dialogue scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient who makes up a doctor showed me to be absolutely incredible. A simple security call and recording check should have prevented the senile from making the killings. It takes almost the entire movie before security officers are brought into the movie to get the patient out of the hospital. I couldn't see a person doing so much damage, just as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> Also, George C Scott's character is "overtime" (another saying is calculated) because the script has too many things to do at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes you could accuse as many as 20 different doctors and deny what they should have done or did not. With nurses and assistive technology it is the same story. Someone's chart was read incorrectly, someone got the wrong medicine and died, the doctor ran the wrong patient than another doctor did the same, blamed a third nurse who was not in the call because the other nurse was supposed to allow the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer. This repetition of medical uncertainty is unforgettable. However, the murder sub-plot is a distraction more than an aid to this movie. When focusing on this movie is on the employees' incompetence and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the evil patient's daughter are forcing the movie into a mysterious type "Who did it?" scenario that seriously hurt the quality of the movie. When the loony patient reveals how he did the killing, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need "find the killer" food-patient sub-plot? I think the only point in Scott's character that has a relationship with the senile patient's daughter was to give him someone to communicate with. The hospital should have maintained its cure for medical science by removing love interest and crazy patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent BS within its walls more often. In an era where this film could have been phenomenal, the subplot stories make the movie very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
