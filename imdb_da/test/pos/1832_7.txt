I will start by saying that I've always been a Bonnie Hunt fan .... She always adds life to any character she plays, and she did a wonderful job in her direct debut. I have to admit This is a chick flick ... But it is a wonderful story, it touches many emotions and evokes all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays real life as people with real life similar situations. (I have to exclude the randomness that is the biggest part of the movie). It's a love story .. not just for a man and a woman, but love for family, friends and loved ones past. (Even pets). I really enjoyed it. Worth renting or buying.
