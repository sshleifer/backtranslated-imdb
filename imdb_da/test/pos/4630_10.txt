I think this movie should be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times. The film starts in principle with a suicide on a school toilet. You can't see who it is, and from there it goes to the beginning of the day, and we know 6 characters, and they go through some pretty heavy stuff, yet one of them will eventually commit suicide. /> <br /> I have been teaching Physical Education in Schools for 8 years now, and never in a movie have I seen such a precise depiction of what really happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible. The end is so shocking, and so what you wouldn't expect, is something that will haunt me in the days to come. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely one to see. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the director / writer was in school a few years ago is an important contributing factor to the healthy honesty expressed in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot in two separate 'modes' if you like. First, there is the smooth form of observation where we learn the knowledge of their school environment as they go through their drama, but the amazing part of the film is in the interview sections where we learn the knowledge of the stories and their deepest darkest thoughts. You wonder who should it be (who commits suicide) and when the drama unfolds, you keep changing mind until it gets hit, it hits you in the face for the last five minutes. I'm everywhere in my writing, but I've just seen it at a media screening in Australia, and I'm still in a bit of shock. <br /> <br /> It's been one of the best Australian movies I've seen in recent years.
