Only for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood is very strong but discreet presence is a great asset to this very good documentary. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on several private archives showing him as a child, as a young man, as a family member with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.), as an elder man, finally as a sick and near death man. After the "end" I didn't have the feeling that I knew the man much better. But I have used a very good moment and see many of the best moments of his film; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold. The film shows, most interestingly, how Cooper's career can be paralleled with the development of the United States before and after World War II. Two of the great moments are the time when Cooper must respond to justice about communism in the film world; and when James Stewart (also very large) received an award for Cooper a month before his death. I'm not a crying pot, but ... it was close! See it if you can: it's so much worth it. ... If you love Cooper, it is. Or an older America ...
