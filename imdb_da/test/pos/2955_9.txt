This is certainly one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw "catching friedmans" a short time ago and must admit I thought it was better. The story is not incredibly shocking, but it is a good study of confined personalities and relationship cooling war. Block gently leads the viewer through diaries, family recordings and in-flight interviews; His interview style is sensitive and exploratory, and his insight is clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Birch Street is a good study of personalities and relationships for over 40-50 years of social change, social fallout and redemption potential.
