Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears at the end! You can't see this movie and don't think about the problems it's raising, how can you justify killing (whether it's murder or death penalty) and at what point is forgiveness possible (not just in a spiritual way). Don't watch this movie when you're down! But watch it !!!
