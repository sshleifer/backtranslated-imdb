It has taken me about a year now after watching this movie to write about it. Lord knows I wanted to see that, I knew I saw something I hadn't seen before, but wasn't sure why. Now, after reflecting for some time, I know, these are the signs that even now I still can't stop thinking about. <br /> <br /> Distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative (Yusuf) who comes from rurals to live short with a good off making photographer (Mahmut) in town hoping to find employment. But it becomes clear that after Yusuf hypothesizes the idea of ​​being a sailor and his prospect dim, he really searches for something else, a kind of purpose in his life. Throughout this soul, we are looking for a seasonal environment that has been filmed exquisite. The context in which they take place makes the scenes more powerful in 2 special when a girl Yusuf has followed suddenly meet with her significant other, and Yusuf's face looks like he looks into a basket of fish and shot and lights reflects his tortured face. This scene in itself must be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces I have witnessed, I do not know how long. In the end, Mahmut has his own demons too, but ends up confronting his relatives that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a very simple scene, but has a sense of genuine heartache. <br /> <br /> What the viewer is left with is a lot to reflect on and think about these 2 people who can all see themselves in. You should not be put off by the pace of this movie, it is really worth every breathtaking second. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
