The DVD jacket where this movie came, describes it as "uplifting and humorous." It's not the words I would have chosen - not by a long shot. I would choose a word like "gloomy", sometimes even "depressing". That's not to say it's a bad movie. It is actually a really good movie with good performances from the leaders, with enough uncertainty all around what should happen at the end that you are watching. The uncertainty comes from the film's structure - it seems to be about Ellens reminiscent of her mother's slow death against cancer, when she is interviewed by DA. So we know from the beginning that something has happened suspiciously at the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen - the slightly annoying daughter who has to give up her life and work in New York to return home to look after her sick mother. Through the film - moreso than any other character - as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents, her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is quite interesting, my first impression being that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship begins to show after a while, Hurt was effective as the detached man - not detached in a grim manner, but in the sense that he could not cope with what happened to his wife and seeks to escape from it in various ways. Finally, Meryl Streep, as the crushed Kate, was very convincing in her role and tried to live out what is left in her life in the most satisfying way, and then deal with anger, she feels about her growing wear and tear. about a family agreement with this kind of crisis a little "ordinary people", even though this movie was far less emotionally intense. So not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to the one who wrote synopsis on the DVD jacket) but very good in his own way. 10.7
