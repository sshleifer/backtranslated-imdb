"Porgy and Bess" is an outstanding production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is tastefully done in muted colors. The voices are excellent. Although Sidney Portier's voice is dubbed his song, he gives a very touching performance. There is a remarkable performance by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is no DVD available for viewing yet, and this piece asks for one. All intelligent filmmakers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals, including the excellent of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask for it for your video provider. As the "South of Songs" by Walt Disney, it may be the assumption of racial overtones that prevent the marketing of this cinema.
