As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He is just as aggravating. I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over. <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Sly is again homeless and is back to feeding trash cans. He tracks a cruise ship leaving the port nearby and decides to board aboard when eating Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides an appropriate step to the following haninks, and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid sea disease. If only once, he succeeds in chewing and swallowing, thus ending the annoying Canarian eternity forever. But when comics with the main character Tweety go, it is quite good here, but it is entirely thanks to the brilliant cat.
