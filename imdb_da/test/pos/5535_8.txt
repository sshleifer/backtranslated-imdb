I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie. If you don't like this movie for what it is - a stupid, over-the-top, mob story - then you simply read too much into it. This movie is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape the "life" and the problems that accompany her. Michelle Pfeiffer is an amazing 80's jersey, an uncertain, unpleasant mob wife, while Matthew Modine is an anal-reluctant mob tracking politician who falls for her. The reason is probably predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of Mob Wives. If you're not looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80-year-old cult classic. You can't stop seeing if you start.
