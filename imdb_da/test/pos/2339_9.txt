All budding filmmakers should watch this movie - it is like a master class in digital film making itself. Some of the scenes seem to have been shot at much higher production values ​​than what they really have been. It is very encouraging that such a well-designed work can be done on a low budget. The actors are very good and the characters are very interesting, especially for the lead king (John Kielty), who manages to play a teenager who is experiencing difficulties while remaining really nice. His beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed, and the relationship between her and her boss was very exciting. This is a very quirky, interesting piece, and I will look for something else made of the same team. The director is determined to see.
