Stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. After the college class, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his former wife dead and Owen (Devito) wants his mother (Ramsey) dead. When Larry discovers that he wants his wife dead, Owen knows what to do for him to get a favor in return for Larry killing his mother. Devito is absolutely fun in this as the brain-dead wannabe writer who has daydreams of poisoning her mother and scissors through her head. He has a child as a role that makes him seem more confused than a killer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Academy Award for this because of her wonderful performances as the old old Mrs. Lift. Along with having comedy, the film also has a heart. A scene between Devito and Crystal seems like a joke, but goes deeper, making me a little sad. Danny Devito oriented the film and did a good job of getting the dark tone in his direction. For any fan of comedies I recommend this. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 min. PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
