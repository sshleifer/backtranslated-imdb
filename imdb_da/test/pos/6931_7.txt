I was on the world premier of this movie and even met Todd a few times around town (once at Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he is just a film producer with little or no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's good if you like zombie movies with very little plot and lots of blood and gut. You see some Kansas City places and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (with just a change of clothes or hats). You can have a good drinking game with this movie, take a shot when you see the same zombie in another shirt.
