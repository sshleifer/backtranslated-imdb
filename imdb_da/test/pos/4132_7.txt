Considering that it's basically low budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flip about the rock pioneer's life and death, Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for virtually all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a number of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to star, marriage with his girlfriend and possibly death. I like this movie and believe you will too. Charles Martin Smith also does a good job in this movie.
