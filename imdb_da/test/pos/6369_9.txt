As a fan of Dan Aykroyd I watched this movie as it was recently shown in the middle of the night on television. I don't expect much, so it came as a great surprise that I loved it so much. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that Dan Aykroyd seems to love doing. A chance for him to "catch it up" and not take it too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you know what I mean and you'll be wise to check out The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Avid fans of Aykroyd will also have fun watching all the small links to his other movies in the script! <br /> <br /> I can't describe this movie without spoiling it for you, so all I can do is tell you to check it out. I can't praise this movie highly enough and it must definitely be time for a DVD release !!
