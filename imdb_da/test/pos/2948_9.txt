This movie is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of a woman and a man and their search for happiness in the midst of the boring, rote life of a housewife and the "house man". It could be any couple, every family, in any city ... but that's what makes history so moving. It touches us all somehow and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it ... and what more could you ask for from a movie, really? Especially a documentary. This is an excellent movie and one that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys documentaries, stories of families like yours, stories of love, life, parents, loss, expectations, chasing, longing, wandering through life and finding the way or not.
