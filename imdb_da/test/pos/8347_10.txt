Lady and Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is a cool movie that many children today can really relate to. It is a well-presented story of a child who longs for the freedom to do things in his own way, and how he goes about getting that freedom is only part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget about the distressed disappointments as the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a puppy's view, for it is only 0.5% or less of the film's wonderful effect on the viewer. Great music, lively plays, talented animations and instructions and a strong story tell of the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a cozy home with your family. And it doesn't matter how bad things work, your family and friends are "always there" to help you even if you're tight. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the soundtrack!
