SPOILERS AHEAD ?? In the first ten minutes of Star Witness, we are introduced to a quote typically urban American family unquote in a nameless city, which is another way of saying the Warner Brothers version of NYC. Apart from the small children, including the charming Dickie Moore and Sally Blane, they are quite a dull mass and their dining table conversation is boring and we want the story to move together and bring the star Walter Huston up. But wait, people, wait. All of the sudden serious gangster movies break out and draw the family against their will, and then this baby never lets up. There is excitement, an Oscar nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to be? it is here. I question Chic Sales Performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence proves to be crucial to the plot. He has been treated with special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. must really have been high on Sale, but how his corny old man routine fits into the public is something lost to me. Perhaps it is lost in time, an unnoticed factor you might be a 1931 film grille to understand. The climax is also typically melodramatic. Nevertheless, this is currently the best publication of the study year I have seen so far (though I've only seen eight, so maybe it's an unimaginable sight). Don't miss this when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10
