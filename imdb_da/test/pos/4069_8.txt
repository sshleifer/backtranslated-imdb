I've read many reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I have noticed many reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" movie. The Niro is by no means Murphy's mate all over this movie. In fact, part of the comedy in this movie is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anyone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this. He is back on doing what he does best as a complete ham. He is a policeman who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought the two had great chemistry and were a perfect cast. Rene Russo is also great as a TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro as well. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, who repeats his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" as the police. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in "Confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-like politician to stop in place of De Niro. Man, it was fun! Comedies often depend on your personal taste. Sure you can poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the mating of Murphy and De Niro ... I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be mated to the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
