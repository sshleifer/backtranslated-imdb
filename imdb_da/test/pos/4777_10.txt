This 8 minute gem is not only timeless, but it is a cartoon milestone. It's Mickey's third comic, and also one of his best. It's a cartoon milestone because it was the first with sound. And my goodness, even after 70+ years, is ever so good, and gives real extra weight to the story. The black and white animation is excellent and the characteristics are convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, it adds fun, the character has, no matter how thin the story is sometimes. And the comic is fun! So many memorable moments that the cow's teeth are used as a xylophone and its udder as a bag pillow. The characters are also engaging, Mickey and Minnie's two landmarks Disney characters are well spoken by Walt Disney, and Pete serves well as the "villain of the play". All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
