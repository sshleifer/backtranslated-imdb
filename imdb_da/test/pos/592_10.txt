I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie deserves to be up there with the best of them. It's extremely entertaining, thanks to Jerry Juhl's sharp scripts, and the movie looks great with some beautifully decorated music tracks. When I talked about the songs, I really liked them that they were not the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially never before. Never before is one of my favorite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as usual were amazing, especially the always lovely Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was amazing. And what a brilliant human caste - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who led us hilarious films such as What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, everyone who made memorable guest work if you were careful not to overshadow Muppets in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
