I saw Pola X because Scott Walker composed the movie scene and I admire his music a lot. Frankly, I expected a slightly pretentious and possibly incoherent French film. I was mistaken. The film's vision quickly succeeded in fully incorporating my attention - starting with the opening sequence, showing black and white recordings of military aircraft that throw bombs in graves by the sound of sound and Scott Walker's beautiful complaining voice. The film explores Pierre (the Guillaume Depardieu Identity Crisis - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts? The first shows Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house on the French countryside, and the other follows his complete personal resolution after giving up everything and moving to Paris to live in shadow with his supposed half-sister. Both include some amazingly beautiful photography ?? the first very colorful and bright, the other totally gloomy and almost apocalyptic - adds up to a genuine aesthetic celebration. Pola X is a fascinating and unique film experience.
