In KPAX Softley brushes on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film for the real purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it is as if the statements he makes show general truths about a culture of peace strongly proclaimed in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is 'light' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the moment - and appreciates it and by some points fears it, as he transcends his social structure of reality and becomes more human. The film is particularly detailed, so I recommend that you see it at least twice to see how Softley narrows shades. Listen carefully to the stories at the beginning and end, as they really touch on concepts that are not commonly presented in Western philosophies. 9 out of 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement.
