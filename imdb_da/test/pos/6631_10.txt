I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in the works of art, because they are humans and the vast majority of people are lazy by nature. That said, the notorious notion that Ingmar Bergman's great 1968 film Shame (or Shame) is just an anti-war film is a great damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to his more cinematic splendid predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is apparently a more classic movie in terms of narration. But the keyword is apparently because even though it lacks the brave pop psychologization of Persona and Hour Of The Wolf's horrific horror film, it is one of the best movies ever made about war - and not as an anti-war film, not even a pro-war movie. As such, it should be ranked with Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best screenplays, if not the best. Though it seems to be a more psychological outer film than the movies before it, it really says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod to the infamous American spies that many European intellectuals thought were innocent), two musicians who used to play for the local Philharmonic Orchestra before a war broke out and they retired to live on a small plot on an island that was happy to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in is not named, just like the island they live on, even though the film was made on Bergman's small island Farö just outside the Swedish end of Göttland's northern end. It seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps involved in a civil war with rebels from another province. This is all deliberately unclear as this war is meant to symbolize all wars. This is amplified as the movie starts with various war notes on the screen as the credits roll. These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Your American Military Figures. After early scenes depicting the prosaic nature of their rural life and saw the coming of war, where even old men are accused, an air raid ravages Rosenberg's land when hostile jets fly overhead, drop bombs, and what appears to be chemical An agent's weapon Orange as the nature. A plane is hit, and a parachute jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree. Jan, who starts the movie as an insidious sweep, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they find the pilot shot. It seems that he is actually part of the invading, or possibly rebellion, force. A bunch of government soldiers quickly stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, so advise the couple to leave their home as the Invaders are near. there are misinterpretations of the film at a micro level, such as Bergman school teacher Marc Gervais, who gives the film commentaries on the DVD in the film. Like many critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling who has collaborated with Invaders. But it is clear and demonstrably wrong, because Jacobi is with the original fascist government. As evidence, the invaders are first rejected after they invade Rosenberg's land and shoot their agitprop interview. We know this because the government, which later asks them about the fake interview and words put into Eva's mouth, sees the film as evidence of their betrayal, and Jacobi clearly works with them, the fascist big brother statistics. Secondly, Jacobi is responsible for determining which of the urban populations are sent to concentration camps to cooperate with the invaders, and the Rosenbergs are again among those who are saved. Thirdly, in her seduction of Eve, Jacobi tells that his son is left from the military, and clearly, if he was an invader, he would not be so lucky about his son serving the state. Also rebel forces are not official armies, and do not give official leave. Finally, Philip is clear with the rebels, or Invaders, of the organization, and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> Gervais and other critics so openly and scary interpret and flatten out such a key, and the obvious point of this movie questions their ability to distinguish between all aspects of Bergman's film. This is a wonderful and great movie and very high in the Berman cannon, but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers really understand their complex message, instead choosing the cheap, lazy and easy claim to be merely anti- war and a fairly simple film compared to its two prominent predecessors. And it is in the long run the real shame of the shame.
