This is a slice of other films by the genre: Genuine exciting, intelligent, brilliantly acting and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but it is partly what makes it such a blow. See it twice if you can. You get almost as much to see it when you know the twist than you do from seeing it the first time. Don't be discouraged by the fact that this movie comes from Korea, a country not known to most Western audiences. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are far too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness, and retribution. All of these are handled excellently by Lim Su-jeong as the Su-mi, the protagonist. Also worth mentioning is Yum Jung-ah, who delivers a deeply scary and disturbing performance as a grandmother. <br /> <br /> Although it has its scary moments, it is not really a scarecrow that most people would imagine. It is more a psychological tension story with an element of mystery. It grabbed you from the start and will keep you guessing at the end - and possibly beyond!
