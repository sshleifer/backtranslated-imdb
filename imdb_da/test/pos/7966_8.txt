At the end of his career Jack Arnold, a very efficient director who gave us such classical 50's creations as "It came from outer space", "Creation from the Black Lagoon" and "Tarantula" struck with former soccer star turned top 70's blaxploitation movie director Fred "the Hammer" Williamson for a couple of films that produce the gracious if the pristine Western "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshingly soft, clever and entertaining 70s black action variant on your standard 40s movie noir Williamson shows one charming combination of dry, self-indulgent humor and relaxed, moody self-confidence as Shep Stone, a cheap, gracious and forever in debt meanwhile los angel cop became a private investigator. Stone is so hard for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and just barely gets to make penny-ante low paid smaller cases that the police won't break with. While pounding the pavement for one of these misleadingly simple footage (Stone is trying to find a guy's running teenage daughter hiding somewhere in Hollywood), he finds himself elbow deep in a complex, dangerous, apparently bottomless, criminal plot that includes a triggered Jesus freak religious cult, various dead hippie dopers, a sordid porn ring, an invaluable missing gold-tipped stick belonging to a legendary silent movie star, a prison underground drug trafficking operation, and an ever-increasing number of fresh corpses. <br /> <br /> While the lack of playful, eerie ingenuity of Robert Altman's mastery "The Long Goodbye" or the frightening, incessant pessimism of Arthur Penn's beautifully gloomy "Night Moves," the Black Eye still makes the character as one high successful hip'n'flip 70's spin on 40's mystery suspense thrillers. Arnold's talented direction keeps pace with a nice and stable clip characterized by occasional exciting mano-a-mano-only knuckle-fighting scenes and excellent exploitation of various colorful seedy LA sites (the abandoned amusement park at the conclusion of the movie is extremely effective) . The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin provides a good amount of rather complicated and often really surprising plot phrases. And the expected selection of quirky secondary letters is an interesting oddball pile, with Rosemary Forsyth as an amazing, strong lesbian model agency owner (Forsyth has the best line of the picture and boasts Stone when she meets him first, "I'm a lot of woman") , Teresa Graves of "Get Christie Love" TV shows fame as Stone's loyal bisexual girlfriend (movie's casual, nonjudgmental depiction of both Foryth's unconventional femme fatal and Graves' just atypical crazy Friday is one of his strongest assets), and Bret Morrison, who made the voice of the radio's "The Shadow" in the 40s as a smugly sleazy porn movie maker. All in all, it is a modest, yet surefire winner.
