Well, my dad drove Lee Evans back and forth in the hotels so I got to see some being made. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally hit it and it went into a fence and he fell over. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said you were cold, I said yes and he said goodbye to your hands in your pockets! I think it was really fun, and it will be a familiar comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were really good people. they seemed to be quite polite and fun. I'd like to meet them again one day. Brenda Blethyn went out of her caravan with blood down her and twigs in her messy hair and I became really scared since I didn't see her until she was just behind me
