Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update to the swashbuckling tradition that goes on Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is merciless, with a touch of social commentary, but not too heavy. You can almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in this. <br /> <br /> It starts off low with the introduction of the characters and the creation of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but it kicks into high gear when the boys hit the highway. The robbers are large and stylish, with romantic details that are bread and butter of swashbucklers. The actors are engaging and help raise the material a little, which is pretty hollow. There is not much depth in the characters, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Muh has been told about modern music. Period music tends to be quieter, which works out of place. A classic score with Celtic rhythms for the pieces of action could work, but the more modern rebel rock and techno music seemed to put an end to the action. Since the characters are more legendary than reality, the accuracy of the music seems meaningless. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the aerated scenes so that it works the most. I just wonder how they missed Adam Ant's "Stand and Deliver." Don't make mistakes, it's not a serious movie. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual flair, but I don't think we're going to see many Oscar nods in his career right now. He seems to understand the material here and pulls out a nice movie. Over time, he can turn out to be a name to count on. His father took a while to mature beyond visual styling and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling movie party.
