When I first heard that this movie was to be made, I was very excited to see it. The ideas for making a movie of this caliber, as good as it was, must have been very difficult. I wasn't quite sure if anyone could include all of the pope's many amazing qualities in a movie, but the film made its memory fair. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal the people that the pope started as. For his days in Poland, until his last days in the Vatican, this film followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life and on, did a very good job of getting the feelings over. Overall, this film was educational but also very entertaining.
