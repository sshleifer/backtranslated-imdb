Changi has a nice fresh script, which performs excellently by both young and old players. John Doyle has done an outstanding job bringing humor to a tragic story that keeps a funny story of fun and excitement, especially for those who are not familiar with the events of Southeast Asia during World War II. <br /> <br /> John Doyle's parallel narrative line successfully leaves the gap between past and present, giving the public insight into the long-term impact war had on the prisoners and their families' lives as well as the foundation of an excellent narrative that nicely rounds the narratives both individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. We have previously been delighted with his abundant and quick sense of humor as evidenced by his long-standing collaboration with Greg Pickhaver as `Roy & HG '<br /> <br /> As the series approaches halfway, we look forward to how the story develops with expectation.
