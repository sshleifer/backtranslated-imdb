This is one of the best horror movies I've seen for a while. An eerily abandoned house, interesting figures, gore and a twisted plot. Who could ask for something more in a horror movie? It is pretty predictable for the most part, but then again most horrors you can find out in the first 10 minutes, so I won't mind it. The music, camera angles and so on are excellent. The set is good and very convincing. There were virtually no subplots, but it was a horror movie for many alternative plots only taking away from what would have a horror anyway ... Being scared ... This keeps it pretty simple and just does it. If I were to compare it to another movie, I would say it reminded me of the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Absolutely a horror movie lover should see.
