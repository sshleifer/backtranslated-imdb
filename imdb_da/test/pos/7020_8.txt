Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at some point. I remember as a child, I loved this movie and watched it over and over without getting tired of it. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a little older, I recently bought the DVD and still wasn't disappointed with the show. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere of this movie, although it is claimed that they do not come together, chemistry in the movie is incredible! As the film continues, we suck into their relationship and believe in each one of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds the relationship between Baby & Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line "Noboby puts Baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, of all ages it is just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy 8/10.
