This film, based on the book by Pascal Laime 'La Dentelliere, is a recognized film with excellent filmography and costly Italian language. Seen in a "scholastic" 19th century, the Balzac style set, it portrays the story of a crazy love story: a man and a woman. There is a notorious line of this shady Mussolinni strike that says, "She doesn't smell like tomatoes." Sage perfume of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is a director of Mussolinni's style: his cake will jump into your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives like a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This scares the HELLA out of you: Don't forget to visit Mussolini's cake next to the Colisseum in Rome, over Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside and out, it will make you cry out of romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses, you will dry it well with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!
