One cannot help admiring Mike Judge for his hands on "I have experienced that" approach. With "Office Space", almost anyone working a job can associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling for it. You can easily appreciate the 505 years later experience of our heroes, because again the director has tried to put things on a very human level. Ever resembling Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this movie is very fun. Don't miss the deleted scenes as the "Museum of Speed" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is wildly imaginative, extremely fun and a solid 8.0 movie experience. - NOTE
