After growing up in Czechoslovakia, I followed the story of RAF pilots and crews in World War II, their stories and tragic endings either in the fight or in the Communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, although the fact that the brave men we can go through all this and recover afterwards is amazing. For all people who want to watch big movies ... this is the one! During the last visit to the Czech Republic, I watched this movie three times in three days (we just play it for three days ... otherwise I will go and see it even more times !!! It's worth it!) I hope you will enjoy It, though it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story, much the same as the movie "Kolya" was. It's not a simple movie because of the deep story, and the way it tells you will most likely make you cry ... it made me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak always did a good script, his son Jan made a fantastic movie and cast? Undoubtedly, they all did a good job, I was amazed at Ondrej Vetchy, with the great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all other actors who made this movie simply BIG !!! If this is not an Oscar nomination, I think I'll be on strike in Holywood.
