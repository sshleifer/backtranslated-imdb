This movie was a pretty comfortable watch for me, I think it wasn't great, but it was one of the better horror movies in the past. It seems to be the low, almost state budget budget, but it has the charm of the lovely ladies in it. The atmosphere was also good (as it lacks from a hell of many horror movies these days). The action was your typical 80's low budget affair that if you don't know it's "dud" acting. But that's what Lucio Fulci's movie was full of, they liked this movie had atmosphere, what they lacked in history and money, etc. They more than made up the horror & gore & atmosphere of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low budget horror movie that can be seen, I saw it all and I love horror movies. I've watched movies where I just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and flush it up if it's on video or skip the scene on the DVD. This movie didn't make me do it, I sat and saw it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it, but if the zombie type people in this were a little more scary then they were so scary to have Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter, not. But seriously, though if they were a little better, it would have been low budget perfection, perhaps. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank you and goodness, even though this movie didn't have any of the metal music in it. I've been a die-hard metal fan since 1990, but in horror movie metal music destroys it, the movie loses the atmosphere a lot when any kind of music except a score plays. So I'm glad there was no music in this movie except just your typical score that was pretty scary, well done. <br /> <br /> It might need "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams" on it self. Because it is keyboard music, there are no guitars that are nothing but "truly" scary keyboard tracks. Like the track a "Forever Sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and a goose bump that evokes keyboard music that follows it. Ever on that CD is the same, ideal horror music at its best, it would have suited this movie perfectly. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive chick in the movie for me was the one who got chibbed / killed (or we are led to believe) and hung up like a scarecrow, just to be free and try to escape later . All the other women in the movie were lovely, a great 9 out of 10 for all of them except the one I mentioned above. I want Hollywood (the mainstream side of things) to give money to Romero and the guy who made this movie. As giving them to movies is far better a decision than giving it to a goon muppet called Paul Anderson for the "resident evil" mince. <br /> <br /> Good guys, it's not bad, not bad at all I loved the part at the end credits as they kept you showing clips of them making the movie (behind the scene). Not many movies do this kind of thing, which I thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you have some outcomes, and that is always a good thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the film 9/10, rating for the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5 / 10.
