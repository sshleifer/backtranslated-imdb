Captured this flick as one of a five-for-$ 5 deal from a local video store and it was a most enjoyable surprise. It is a collection of four interconnected narratives built around four children who have just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other about these stories to kill time and are occasionally frightened by flashing lights and funny sounds that all come together in an O. Henry esque end that left me happy. A real discovery. Blood (and lots of it), breasts and animals surround it perfectly ... Jacinda Barrett alone is the price of access. This is a keeper - Jim Bob says check it out. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "Pumpkinhead" was also one of our five choices, and IMDB recommends it to anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I follow up as soon as I get a chance to sit and see one. Joyeux Samhain!
