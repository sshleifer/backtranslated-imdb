With all due respect for Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Section S will forever be associated with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonair womanizer cum detective in the mold of Austin Powers, but it will do a bad service for the character: he is far more nuanced than that. Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the evil and only chips at the end), he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether or not he has read his novels), much of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sucks when Annabelle is right ... and she is often. He is clearly a man who has a life crisis and drinks drive, but ....... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero, it would not have worked, but he often shows King as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love for finery, and inclined to grandstanding (and this gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and puts down the television story. And by not playing him whiter than whites, chemistry and interactions between the three main characters are better for it. <br /> <br /> Watch it again on DVD recently, and you'll see how much depth Wyngarde put in Jason King.
