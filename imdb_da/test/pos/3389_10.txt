I agree with the messages here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and waited eagerly for the release of the mini-series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was really good, I was disappointed that the film did not follow the book. I was glad that Orry was not killed as he was in love and war or N&S II. Having grown up in SC and graduating from the University of SC, I fell in love with Southern history because of this mini-series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. Afterwards I stayed behind and met Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately I didn't ask him a question. But meeting him was enough. I led in accounting, but got my minor in Southern Studies. In addition, I patterned many of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel I was born 150 years late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of it. <br /> <br /> Now I fell in love with 2 women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, I had hots for Wendy !!!! I could never quite find a true version of her. I hope one day too !!!
