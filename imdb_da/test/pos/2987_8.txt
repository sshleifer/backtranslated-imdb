Most of these reviews have died, so I have to cut for another hunt and answer a few questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters look and look young (hence the controversy), the actor / actor himself was 17 and 18 at that time and apparently over the 16 barrier. Here in the US it is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film do much to compensate for it. I'm not sorry to have seen more of Sean; in this film, his expression is at least demonstrative and obvious; You know exactly what the sign is if he is sour, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career whose life was cut short by cancer at the end of 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> VHS tapes of FRIENDS can be viewed at Amazon.com occasionally, but usually for a significant price; I've seen it as low as $ 60 or so and as high as $ 152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price). The sequel video PAUL & MICHELLE is not quite as expensive and can be obtained (when available) on Amazon for between $ 16 and $ 70 on average.
