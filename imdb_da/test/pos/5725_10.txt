In the wake of my personal study of the pending "final cycle" time of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this movie should be viewed as much as "What the Bleep We Know?" While some may think that top-level science issues should only be disseminated at doctoral level numbers, the "Elegant Universe" breaks such barriers. The visuals and the selection dialog make it easy to understand this tour through the history of physics. There are many messages in this movie, of which at least is that academic science must always be ready to revise what is being taught. True, the pure exploration is beautiful because there is always something extra and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to find it out in the light of "established" science.
