This is no walk in the park. I saw it when it came out and didn't mind seeing it again. You will never see a more horrible devastating or depressing movie. I felt I had been hit hard. What kind of world do we live in when we have children treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we are allowed to do. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible for this. Babenco made this movie wake us to shake us to our core and he succeeded. How can we be cruel or self-righteous or neglected by our children when we see the graphical results of such behavior? He points to a finger of accusation by all of us to make this at least and least powerful in our society. And if you do nothing every day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. I'm NOT a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think of the state of my soul.
