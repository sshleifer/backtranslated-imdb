First off- What do some of you think? This is the best movie I've seen for years! <br /> Next, I'm not thinking of it as a British movie as it is set in Dublin and mainly has Irish actors-Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. <br / > Third, I thought Moran was excellent. He was fun fun through. Micheal Caine only seemed to be there to get Moran context. Every character he took, he was perfected. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought was better than any other children's actor I've seen. She was credible as the wise child and also as a child and an adult (yes I know it sounds strange, but hey ...). Even Caine succeeded. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very fun in the preparation stage. Barreler (Gambon) was very fun in his awkwardness.
