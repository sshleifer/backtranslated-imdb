This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick "Gangs of New York" can measure up with a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3, which is not plagued by two rival gangs - but a big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like killing a person with an ax if he violates his set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, gently plays in this action-packed movie filled with a lot of shooting-up violence. So, as Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only James Bond's love scene scenes would do much better. <br /> <br /> In addition to his .38 Kersee plays with this new gun called Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey gun packs a big blow, and when Kersey kills it, it doesn't matter that the gun has a big kick in it. <br /> <br /> And the anti-tank missile that killed the main gang leader? Well, that's something. Kersey didn't want to use an antitank missile as his regular vigilant weapon .... it's too military for him.
