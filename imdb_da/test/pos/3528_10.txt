This was a great 1981 movie that had a great story of three men and two girls walking on a camping trip together and going through thick forests and high mountains with a large waterfall. This group of people run into property owned by George Kennedy (Roy McLean), who plays the role of a forest ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these young people that wherever they go, there is no room for camping and they should return. Of course, these youngsters pay no attention and continue to swim in the neck near the waterfall and play good music and dance by the fire and have lots of beer and wine. There is an old tree a room school house that pulls gals and guys inside and it is from the time the movie starts to become very scary. There is an opportunity when a young girl has to climb a tree to get away from a human animal who wants her body and begins to chop down the tree to catch her. Don't miss this movie, there is plenty of everything.
