When I saw the first example of this, I almost went out of excitement. I have long been a fan of twelfth night - it made me Shakespeare, so to get a modern twist is a dream come true. My expectation was not disappointed. The reason basically follows the original story and that means: complicated! I won't even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. Imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all kinds of situations that would create. I will not even question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is NOT the point in the movie. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is absolutely fun. Almost every scene nails the comic array. Kudos to authors, instructor and actors on that counter. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she wears it wonderfully. She is super sweet, not a vixen and can make flawless comedy. I admire her so much for not going at full speed on her film or in public life as so many starlets do today. I'm glad there is at least one decent young actress back in Hollywood. OK, I'm out of my soapbox ... Channing Tatum, yes he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes throughout the movie are when he tries to talk to Olivia first by counting on cheese and then later on his workout. <br /> <br /> Also, the rest of the cast failed to perform either with wonderful additions to the characters in the form of inane d√©butante mother and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend. Overall, very fun, loooots of laughs and a very attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it knocks out modern versions of other plays, including the very pointed 10 things I hate about you.
