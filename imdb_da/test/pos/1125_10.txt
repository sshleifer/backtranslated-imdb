I'm so excited that Greek is back! This season really looks eventful. I'm glad Casey is trying to get serious about the school but is still involved in the sorority. It's great fun that she wants to go into politics and that they highlight her scheming talent. I loved Calvin's new hairdresser! It makes him look more mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest one! I can't wait to see more of him! I am especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, & Rusty! I also love Rebecca. She is really beautiful. In fact, I think Rebecca and Calvin should join. Go for it, Calvin! Join my team!
