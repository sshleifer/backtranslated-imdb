Even Maria Montez / Jon Hall technicolored slings of the 40s are obscured by "Princess of the Nile", Fox's entry into Hollywood in the mid-50s obsession with things Egyptian (see "Pharoah's Land", "King's Valley," etc.) Ren , unadulterated, mindless hokum, lavishly produced (low budget, in fact, but using sets and costumes back from "The Robe" it seems that the technicolored spectacle looks like it costs millions). 71 minutes of eye-candy (the plot, which has something to do with nefarious derring-do in ancient Egypt, is next to the point) offers the filmmaker and audience the lovely view of Debra Paget wearing an assortment of transparent veil, most of who hit the ground when she shakes and shimmies through a slave-girl production number unsurpassed in movie history. Female movie players were not shortchanged: Fox's most beautiful young contract player, Jeffrey Hunter, is so photogenic as Mrs. Paget, while Michael Rennie sneaks around in the background and shakes evil actions in the land of the pyramid. For those who may think that Paget & Hunter cannot act and was only recruited for their physical properties, check out their subtle, overlooked, heartbreaking work a few years later in "White Feather" (another Fox production which, unfortunately, has disappeared into riches of "lost movies"). "Princess of the Nile" is still in a class of its own as a cheerful mindless, spiritually fast, dazzling testament to the delights of 3-strip Technicolors - and the seductive charm of Mrs Paget (all 20 at that time). Put this one-of-a-kind kitsch classic at the top of your "guilty pleasure" list and enjoy. Satisfaction Guaranteed!
