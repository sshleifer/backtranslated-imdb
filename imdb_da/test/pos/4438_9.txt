What a tribute to his father! He sat down on a mission to learn more about a man he knew a little about, and at the end of the journey, I think Nathaniel Kahn is happy with what he learned and felt personally. The film is 5 years underway, and a quarter of a century after his death, Louis I. Kahn's total commitment to his work - consistently strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to mankind and timeless to the whole world with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: A Son's Journey". <br /> <br /> The movie is by no means an anthology of Louis' work. There are lots of books and archived materials that contain archives of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary acts as a mystery, author director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn searched for the man he knew briefly as his father. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chapters. In "Heading West" we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It's a sight worth seeing - Kahn's integrated concept of building and environment, optimizing light for researchers at work is fantastic. From a former colleague who worked with 'Lou' 35 years ago, we hear about his meticulous attention to detail, even where "rambunctious" he could be - certainly not chopped words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera is pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skates around the Salk Institute's plaza area - a small figure like a child happily playing in his father's hands. <br /> <br /> The "Immigrant" segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng, the architect who worked with "Lou" and also drilled him a daughter, Alex. Now at 80, Tygen's return with Nathaniel's movie crew for the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey was nostalgic. In "Go to Sea" we see Barge for the American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all made of steel and meeting Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he is "Lou's" son. Boudreau was touched, he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he should not tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a "sweltering" emotional moment for reunion. As his father "The Nomad," Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the synagogue project that his father began but did not realize. He visited the adhesive wall, and when his yarmulke continued to fall off / "breezed off", he gave me the feeling that he did not have to be "completely" Jewish as his father's son. We continue to sit with his two half-sisters in the "Family Matters" segment. We also hear that he speaks to his mother in Maine, and from talking to former office staff at his father's office, we learn how his father worked intensively and practically lived there, sleeping on a blanket on the office floor, weekends and all . <br /> <br /> The end of the journey brought us to Ahmedabad, India, to the Indian Leadership Building. Speech with the architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. Finally, Nathaniel found a very lively Louis Kahn, his father - his spirits live in him. This documentary is a lot of tears for me. I was tearing most of the time - it was very touching and in awe of the man, the architect and his son, and the women of his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to love the whole world, juggling and three families (one can say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration). As Shamsul Wares, the architect of the capital of the Bangladesh complex (completed 9 years after Lou's death) was so carefully noted: Louis Kahn has given the people of Bangladesh a lot, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and the people - as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated man, usually the people close to him, he would often miss seeing. It seems that the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of King Vidor's "The Fountainhead" 1949 (good dramatic story in B / W with music by Max Steiner), based on Ayn Rand's novel, with Gary Cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals, and Patricia Neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life. <br /> <br />
