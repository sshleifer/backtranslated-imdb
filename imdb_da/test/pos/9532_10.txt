Proud and faithful working class ports Perks (Mr B.Cribbins) are gradually being won by the top middle class family on their luck. Father (Mr I.Cuthbertson) imprisoned for treason - for which the punishment was dead these days, not to be forgotten), mother (the very beautiful Miss D.Heridan) brave and inventive, loyal and loving and - mostly - elderly daughter (Miss J.Agutter) shaggy in adolescence - wounded and confused about the fate of her father's father. Mr Perks, like many working people of his time, will have nothing to do with something he thinks of "charity" and that is an important moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday presents he has received of the children, do not compromise his principles. Although the lovely Miss Agutter has received all the awards, it is Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate "The Railway Children". They both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum, but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. But it's basically a movie about family. In an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and ransom her and be considered "socially inept" rather than unfit to live in decent society, and when two "people" can beat and kick a baby without being accused of murder, "family" can be seen as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist self-homophobic concept, but a century ago, it was the glue that kept society together at all levels. 'and Miss Sheridan's families are archetypal for the age. Lovingly, adhering to external influences, integrated entities with a moral security spotted in the 21st century. What seems to be a dull, predictive political channel is being turned by Mr Lionel Jeffries to a lovely hymn for hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all these attributes were once considered the norm and now too often is the object of mockery and cynicism a reflection on our society rather than Miss Nesbit. No one with more than a temporary concern for the human condition failed to be moved significantly by this rather perfect movie.
