After hearing the miniseries, "North & South", I could hardly wait for the continuation, "North & South II." So many years later came Book III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III." FINALLY, the last installment came to the ongoing story of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so surprised by this series that I taped every part of the television and then managed to get family and friends connected, and I saw it again every time someone new saw them. My ties are old and I want this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD!
