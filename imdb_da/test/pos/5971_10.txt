If you have a chance, see this Russian (how should I call them: gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this, or dawn here is quiet or pro-na-dorogah ... And right after that, see again American war films or the international productions, those with the Allies and the Germans, etc. Or even worse, see the Italian war movies. Everything from the west will seem low, constructed, ridiculous in comparison to the Russian films. I am so stunned by the quality of the above-mentioned Russian war films that I cannot find the words to praise their crushing superiority over Anglo-Saxon war films.
