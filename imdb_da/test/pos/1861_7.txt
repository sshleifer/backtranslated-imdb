Real-life man and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which tells the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the release of the "On Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous, world-renowned tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created a huge rift, a skis between the believers of his day and scientists. He was then told to fight against God, and even to "kill God." <br /> <br /> The movie is about Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as her highly devoted and loving wife. A revelatory scene at first, when praying the dining table, and Charles failing to say "Amen" is the shunning of what will follow and of the sharp differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be forever cursed and bring disaster to their family by rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, his faith, and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him observing animals, dissecting their behavior and the sequences that make up their lives, and explaining phenomena of selection to their children, the first born, Annie, who has a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every appearance and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the oldest child, dies later and Charles is haunted by her death, being closest to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and pulled out. I did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by his daughter's ghost, shouting and ranting. Although Charles thinks his wife blames him for his deadly illness, she says very poetically, "The truth is, if I knew what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their ties are solid and unbreakable despite huge differences in faith. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he handles his wife the final copy and tells her she can burn it if she doesn't agree. She stops reading it in the evening and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to the publisher. Ultimately, reason and perhaps also love, triumph, as he makes an accomplice out of his most resistant opponent. It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that his land of breaking ideas was, of course, considered controversial, but was already recognized as vital knowledge of the development of humanity. <br /> <br /> The film greatly draws on Darwin's family life, its joys and its troubles. I happened to like this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary I quote, "Hitler's passion for ping-pong". This is true in some respects, and I cannot disagree with his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories from this movie than we do. It is nevertheless a well done and flawlessy acted period drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabios: 7 Total score: 14
