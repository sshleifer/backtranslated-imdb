(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: crumbling uniforms, human skulls and the horse's skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) chased the Swedish army away and impressed the Mongolian to such an extent that he proposed to promote him to the captain's rank. But Nevsky answers, "Die in your homeland, but don't let it go". He intends to fish, build ships and act. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: easier, more transparent and no opportunity to buy out: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: Mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. The marauding occupation forces distribute the lot. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalist p. R.), but "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. Teutonic Knights feel invincible and have just a slick smile for the Russian women who testify helplessly how their fathers and sons are slaughtered. Children are thrown into the fire while the church's tall dignitaries look at and remain inactive. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: Rig and staid Gavrilo and tall and jolly Vasili. She promises to marry the most brave. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack, but to strike immediately. Even women put on a chain armor ... The invaders want to bait the "Russian bear", but Nevsky's stratagem stands for the test: Peipus Lake is his war zone: His men know the territory, but the Germans who are heavier will break through the ice. .. Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It is not only the many extras (which I thought pushed in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's mastery of such a large number of individuals: he shifts divisions as pieces on a chessboard and almost every shot resembles the composition of a painting of Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in phantastic outfits). Russia in the winter looks scary in itself, but Eisenstone's visual imagination is hors concours. Haps of corpses are thrown into cosmic light under an endless horizon. At night, Olga and other women with torches are looking for survivors. A devoted falcon sits on her master's body while a crow waits for the right time to pick the eyes of the deceased. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. Nevsky is of course Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic, and they have a perfect hairdresser. The Germans are bearded savages and resemble members of the Ku-Klux Klan. The actor who plays Vasili gives a one-man-four-character performance: first weaving, so heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main task is to look heroically. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: He apologizes for the "little soldiers" and swaps the knights for soap. Only a bearded killer and a treacherous president turn to the fine. He does not forget a last warning: Who comes with the sword will die of the sword ... He kept his promise. 10.10
