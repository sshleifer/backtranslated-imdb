The story itself is routine: A boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for children. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a splitting of shootings within 11 weeks, leaving many entertaining gaps that the observing viewer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> But how long it has been, the movie has become, the movie is justified by its music and acting. There is plenty of music featuring classic works by Heifetz and The Meremblum Orchestra, one of the leading youth symphonies of that day, and the mentioned music is excellent. In itself, it would make the picture worth seeing. The leading and scoring tasks were put in the best hands: Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> The action is a contrast study. The children in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, must have driven director Archie Mayo crazy, looking into the camera, overcoming the parts they had, and overstudiously following references to them. But the spontaneity caused by their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the image. The veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly cast in his role, one that he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideally suited to their parts. And the supporting play was a true one. Who are there of character actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in their typical role of the heavy --- all ideally cast. And the bit players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, gravely stated Lee Phelps in his usual role as a policeman and many many more. If you are a fan of character actors, this movie will bring back many memories. <br /> <br /> All in all, the picture is very comfortable and recommended even if you are not a fan of classical music. <br /> <br /> tvcat
