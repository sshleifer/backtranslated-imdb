Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of any American series. In a date as early as 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertainment story, and twenty years later, when I saw it for the first time as a child, I was involved in a great adventure and emotion. Buster Crabbe was the hero we would always be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers the beautiful girl we always dreamed of being in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence as Ming, Merciless. A true predecessor of George Lucas Starwars.
