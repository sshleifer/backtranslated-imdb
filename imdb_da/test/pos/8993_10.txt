I wonder how anyone could dissect this movie. It is based on an actual story. It is not necessarily about "Rugby" itself, so to the one who posted here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. This is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks, hires Emilio Estevez and turns the team around and wins the championship and gives all the warmth and fuzzies. It focuses on a story. It shows how someone can change their lives for the better. The movies now days are about sex, drugs, partying etc. It's Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say this was an inspiring movie with a good message. If you consider yourself a "hard guy" don't see the movie, it won't live up to your standards. If you want to see a good, inspirational movie, this is a good one.
