An excellent thriller all the time. Vijay Anand distinguishes himself as director and editor. Performances by Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the movie, which has its script written for the smallest details. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamor and other demands of history as it evolves. And to top it all, music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya snana more" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, again, Burman Dada confirms unique stature as a top-notch composer with its own style.
