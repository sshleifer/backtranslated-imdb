Surprisingly good movie made in the exorcist's wake about a young woman who is obsessed with a spirit after she goes to a devoted church to restore a life size and a crucified man's life. The piece was Christ and the two twenty, but Christ was sold a long time ago. Errors start when the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman. From that time on, it becomes a blow to the girls' soul. Creepy, scary and much better than you think the movie works because its cast sells the events that are particular adults. It helps that these are genuine people who are flawed so it is easier to relate to them. I really liked this movie and watch it again for the first time in at least a decade. I was shocked at how good it is. Absolutely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles make it work.
