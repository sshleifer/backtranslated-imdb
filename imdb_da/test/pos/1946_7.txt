Although I hoped I liked it a little more, it was still an impressive movie. There were great ideas of all leaders, and the story, while not what I would call cooling, was still effective, and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this movie was the look of the picture, because it always looked cold and humid, and it just seemed to fit the movie well. I also thought that the low budget fits this movie, because I don't think a sharp picture and clear sound would also have worked in a movie that was gloomy. All things considered, it fell a little bit of my expectations, but I am still very happy that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
