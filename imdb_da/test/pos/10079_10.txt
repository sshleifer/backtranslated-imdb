Finding this piece of sandwich between an outdated prequel and a rehashed 80s machomovie on a UPN affiliate's dinner program would be misleading. It deserves better and definitely uses its talented customers' best features to its maximum advantage. Bracco and the Walken team to give a movie that is perhaps predictable for those familiar with their genre make the street-oriented "troubled mind" routine that they are so good at portraying. For a chance to ride a psychological rollercoaster, make a la Fuquas training day back in the world of the early 90's television movies to find "Scam"!
