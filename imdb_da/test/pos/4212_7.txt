It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you didn't expect it. Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in many uneven films, and usually did better when they were in a supporting role, as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Here, their presence as the backdrop for the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is the lightweight heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a southpaw hitter who is very different from the image he portrays for the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter accidentally learns that Johnny is a festive loving woman, his plans to waste that information in a column are interrupted by a whiskey bottle at the head of Johnny's manager Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). Then Doc Johnny's boyfriend Goldie (Ann Sheridan) discusses running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. When both were flying, a police hunt was won in a burning car wreck, and Doc's body was mistakenly identified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing. Claude Rains adopts an Edward G. Robinson snare that does not 'It does not seem like a detective who has been relocated to lamb details after a bad arrest years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good feeling that the body in the car crash was not Johnny. He harasses his boss to hand over the closed case to him and is tasked with getting him out of town and out of the way. Meanwhile, Johnny is seeking advice from his lawyer and wind up being screwed even worse when he is deceived for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Johnny wins at Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, run by a crusty Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is inherited from Granny's brother, a deceased pastor from Brooklyn, and is now home to a band of rag tag street boys (The Dead End Kids) who work the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest in Johnny, now under the name of Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I get a kick from the historical perspective offered in these pre-war games. When Johnny and the boys take a pleasure ride in the yard truck, they fill up at a gas station for a $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) gets the idea that a petrol station on the farm would be a good way to make some extra money, and with that mindset, Jack Dorney decides to take over a childhood boxer offering $ 500 a round for anyone who can stay In the ring with him the Clich√©d premise is turned on, it's ear something when Jack gets knocked out in the fifth round, but then he's earned enough to give the orchard a huge chance of its own. Grandma Rafferty might have been in the ring, she took almost everyone around her on the ring side. When Johnny / Jack enters the wardrobe, Detective Phelan is ready to take him to jail. Knowing that he can solve his reputation with this collar, it is a matter of whether Phelan follows through on his arrest - you will have to watch the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like the Dead End movie where Leo Gorcey is responsible, but he doesn't have much to do in this one. But he makes a nice film flame on the ticket maker at the entrance to the boxing match. Another thought - wouldn't it have been nice if the ever-present picture on the priest's wall had been Pat O'Brien? <br /> Overall, this is a great entry into both John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. If there's a downside, it's not enough screen time for beautiful Ann Sheridan. The movie could have launched even more satisfactorily if Sheridan and Gloria Dickson's roles were reversed as the screen chemistry between Dickson's Peggy and Jack seemed more forced than natural.
