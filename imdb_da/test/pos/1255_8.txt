When the first trailer for this movie was seen by myself, I was curious about what angle the story would take. After all that plot to have its own childhood back to the present, many opportunities open up. Bruce Willis, however, does a fantastic job in the role he got. I was surprised to see how well he could trade in this part. This is also a good career movement as many others have said, but after I have seen it, I now agree. This movie is mainly about remembering the child you used to be, and coming to the realization that you are not the adult you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and a moving story that makes us think. Usually we score on "What if ..." movies. For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question "What if the world should be covered by water and ...?" But, verily, no one used to. However, this movie all affects the theater. True, young children cannot fully understand the idea of ​​growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it has a huge impact on the adults and parents of these children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Though it gets better the second time because you are not thinking so much (about how the child came there and why and all the things) Just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave that cinema. Take that piece of your childhood you have forgotten and enjoy.
