I think this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and provided both a profound and clear explanation of everything on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the last decade. This is definitely worth for people's money! <br /> <br /> I also found a little about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the "Blue Planet" team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough almost certainly lived its high reputation. <br /> <br /> This was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentaries. Many congratulations to the 'Blue Planet' team.
