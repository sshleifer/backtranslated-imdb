I saw "Heaven-Ship" (the "Sky Ship") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the narrative tale of the first trip to Mars, at a time when wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The spaceship does not have a radio, and the hero is taken from the landing area via horse card. Even the intertitles are lovely ... some of them are written in rhymed links in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> Actors performances are ridiculous, largely hand-to-brow histrionics. But the sets are astonishing and easily surpassed something made by Georges Melies a decade earlier (or in "Die Frau im Mond" a decade later). Of course, the plot is simplified. The spacecraft's crew consists of seven thin boys and a fat veil. Guess what a crack. Interestingly, everyone in this movie (except the dubious professor Dubius) believes in God. Even Martians. Impressive, the scenarios have the meaning to recognize that a trip to Mars is no doddle: The title cards show that it takes scientists two years to build their spaceship (which has an air screw) and six months to reach Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive set-up that must have been choreographed: dozens of workers penetrate all the way through the workshop in different directions without hesitation and no collisions. The Danish researchers die their ship "Excelsior" ("packing materials"?) And set course for Mars, even though the Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which does not fly horizontally vertically) lands on Mars, it is greeted by the "Martians" - Martians - who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed carnivore, I eat that portion.) <br /> <br /> Practically, Mars is showing an atmosphere like Earth's, as well as its gravity. In an external shot of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the sun when seen from Mars is the same as it is seen from Earth. I also couldn't help noticing that all the wise older Martians are male. In fact, female elders are thin on the earth here: both the ground-born heroes and the martinic virgin are motherless. The Martians speak a universal language, carry ankhs on their clothes and greet the earth's visitors with the earth's earth ... which, of course, holds them up with its north pole. <br /> <br /> The Martian girl is Marya, played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiters, I have some of the Danish!) We see a chaste dance from March, which may have been two or ridiculous, but is actually quite touching and beautiful. In addition, Martian's funeral scene has a shot that reminded me of a sequence in "The Seventh Seal". I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The "sky ship" has a few flaws, but its production design and its other benefits are far outweighed by its disadvantages. Ole Olsen, who is named in the credits (and who appears from a short prologue) is not associated with Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner from "Hellzapoppin". I would give the "Heavenly Ship" a 12, but the scale peaked at 10 ... saw a full 10 out of 10 for this lovely trip to Mars, the blonde planet!
