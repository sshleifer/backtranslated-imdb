1957's Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, stars John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It's the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes under the film. He has a connection that causes him to work on a cargo crane working for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real man who takes backs from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has an intense aversion to a black man, T.T. (Poitier) that has the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team; Axel speaks Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and socialize with T.T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white school teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When tragedies hit, none of the men at the cargo port will speak to the police, and Axel will address his values, what he stands for and the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> This is a really great black and white movie that is not really about black or white! It's really about the boundaries you put on yourself and know who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the quay. T.T. Charlie teases and gives as good as he gets. There is no discussion about T.T. and Axel spend time together or by T.T.'s son, who has a white teacher, whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a lonely, finds hard to accept any friendship or trust in anyone - these things he learns through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier shines entirely in "Edge of the City" - he is warm, energetic, loving and smart, a man with a genuine enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. Cassavetes are excellent and play a character quite the opposite - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Either way, he's another man now. <br /> <br /> Strangely underrated and unknown film, possibly in the shadow of many of the evil young men's films that came out in the era.
