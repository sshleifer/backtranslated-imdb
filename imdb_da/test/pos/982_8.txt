This movie is really an entertaining, good-fun movie, for kiddies. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the sidekick of a rambunctious boy who has difficulty telling the truth. He eventually works this for a movie script that is being stolen. I don't want to drill you with the details. If you have kids and want to watch an entertaining, if not exciting, kids movie, I highly recommend this one.
