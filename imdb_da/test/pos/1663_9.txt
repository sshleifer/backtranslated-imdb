It's a mystery to me why I haven't caught up to this mastery 50's caper film? turned to brooding noir until now, but I'm certainly happy to report that it wasn't disappointed. I haven't seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years, but on this basis I will probably go back and resume "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" very soon. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name not known to me, but a face well-known in its tiredness and cold, has recently completed a long stay in prison and it is also in these movie (hello, that would not be a story) does not do well with the straight life. An opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night without fear of discovery by a few men. The tight filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people most remember about the film of course, and it is actually quite remarkable; but I liked the half-filled position of the final shootout when the robbery has become sour thanks to one of the great mouths of the thieves; The excellent portrayals of Paris in strong black and white; and Servais' channeling of both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his extra but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a little too sentimental in the end, but it is one of the classics who really lives up to its reputation just like pure entertainment, though what it has to say about the human condition does not is deep or thought-provoking; George Auric, in turn, is a modernist, romantic and jazzy score is another highlight.
