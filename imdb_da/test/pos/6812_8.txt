This was so much better than I expected, the movie oozed proffionalionalism over other B-moive of this kind of budget. The script was good if a little formula, but the actor was surprisingly good from everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey. Almost the good plot and action action is good, especially the car chases and crashes are A-class. All in all, this is an increase over other B movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a bunch of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script defficiencies, it's definitely worth a rental.
