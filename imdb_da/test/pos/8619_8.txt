Another great movie by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulty of shooting a sex scene in a movie. Using Comedy ?? a new genre for Breillat ?? We get a backstage view of film production, but in documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the particular sex scene taken from her former movie "A Ma Soeur", which is the greatest teenage actress. But the film, like all Breillat's work, is not entertainment alone. It is imbued with philosophical observations about sexuality and demonstrates a devotion to purity (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of Breillat's work and a devotion to true emotions. We see the director character harangue the young lead actress and the actor to get the best out of them and hypnotize them in the parts they have to play and propagate a part of themselves that the director can see in them, but they can't see themselves before they reach the heights of acting as they demand of them. She makes meaningful movies, not titulation, but she shows the work needed to produce this, and also gives us insight into both the (particular French) filmmaking process and the psychologist of male? female sexuality.
