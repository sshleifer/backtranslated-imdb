All in all, Big Bad John was a fun and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has got it. If you're a fan of the song (as I am), you know pretty much how it ends. But if you don't or do it and still see it, I strongly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a fun couple with good chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to strict urban people. You need to understand where these people should come from and only a handful of us are left. But even a few townspeople can understand it and appreciate it for what it is: a good home movie that makes you laugh, cry and be inspired.
