To summarize this movie: good for TV, but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I won't see it another time. The concept is good, but it ends up in the movie is just a summary. The end had a 'nice' twist, but it is still unsatisfactory. Perhaps it was the director's intention, but it was not prepared as if it were to be. But then it's an okay kind of movie.
