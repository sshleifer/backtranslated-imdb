I first looked at this movie at the Istanbul Film Festival back in 1994. It was so good I took some friends with me and went to see it again the same week. The characters are very well played and humor here and there is great. It's probably a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel like you are seeing an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines. I guess I'll put it in my VCR and watch it again tonight ...
