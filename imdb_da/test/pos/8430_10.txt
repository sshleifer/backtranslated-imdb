"China's Syndrome" could not have been released at a better time: twelve days after its release, the infamous scrubbing occurred in Three Mile Island. But even if it (and / or Chernobyl) had never happened, this film remains an important look at what could happen through poor management of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon turns into a five-star performance when the supervisor tries to reveal a cover-up on his nuclear power plant, with Jane Fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays his cameraman. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes "The China Syndrome" more worrying, but it's still a movie everyone should see. I hope the people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just because they knew their views and ideals were completely disconnected.
