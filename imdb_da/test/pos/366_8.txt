This is a well designed piece from everyone's favorite master of excitement. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are excellent (especially for movie time). I didn't find the first part of the movie very exciting, but the latter was definitely ready for it with an exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for that part of Guy Haines. Somehow I didn't find him very credible. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as a vicious 'evil guy' Bruno Anthony. Overall, I would highly recommend this.
