Thank goodness not all Dutch people are so ruthless. I think Jason is doomed to most, simply because he has a famous father. Perhaps he is not as big as some of these actors, but he is certainly not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a few years ago and I actually loved it. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I have to say that I really liked his performance from this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> In fact, during the movie, I forgot that he was a son. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you are a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you enjoy it!
