A March 1947 New York Times article, Crossfire described as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "ask questions of racial and religious prejudices more directly against audiences than are accustomed to expect." While RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century Fox made a gentleman's agreement, another story of anti-Semitism. RKO raced to beat the very "ballyhooed" Fox picture to theaters, releasing Crossfire several months before the gentleman's deal. In July 1947, RKO Crossfire screened for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several studies designed to measure public prejudice were conducted before and after screenings of the film. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for its depiction of anti-Semitism in America and became the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture but lost the gentleman's Agreement. It was also nominated for Best Support Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire became best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony Magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for "better interracial understanding." Loved this movie. If you get the chance to see it, watch it.
