This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it is over, you will want more. Well-written and convincing, this film draws you in and holds on. The molding was perfect, the signs purposeful and the outstanding performances. "Nanny" is the standard that all women must adhere to: strong, forgiving, protective and never judgmental. "Nanny", for me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of society. If I was half the woman, "Nanny" is, I might consider myself doing okay. I would have been destroyed if "Nanny" was dead at some point in the movie, but since she's not, I'll definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. I can only hope that the story goes on and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city, piece by piece and person by person.
