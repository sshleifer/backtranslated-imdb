What a great mini-series. The original TRAFFIC stole me completely away from anything else that was on. Far more engaging than the American remake, the original TRAFFIC boasts an amazing cast created by lesser-known actors to North American audiences. Juliette Binoche is the primarily recognizable actress who plays a drug-abused teenage daughter to an official. But it's not the star force that carries this movie (though I enjoyed the American version, I felt it was subdued by the famous Americans in the picture). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the US version before I found the original BBC mini series. Of course, there were no image filters, lush locations and the big name stars / instructor. But gravel and dirt in Europe (through drugworld) perfectly complements the impending sense of danger that permeates this entire movie. The problems, such as Getting drug addicts by giving them more, poor drug abuse campaigns and resistance from foreign governments to help destroy their drug cultivators from within, makes every TRAFFIC bold, immersive and awful in the same way! <br /> <br /> The truly incredible parts of the movie are all from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem really was in Europe ... even everywhere! For a real education on drug problems, besides how they affect the human body, see both this and the American version. Each shows a very clear and undeniable fact. These countries, who are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to death and suffering for many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
