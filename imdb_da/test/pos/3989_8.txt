I've always seen this movie, I've seen it so many times, but I've always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P They don't look like that in Romania. Nevertheless, Ghita Muresan plays right in the story Well, but as someone said before me, his English must improve. <br /> <br /> And there were some fun moments and some tragic / sad parts too. It was worth seeing, I thought it was nice that the giant wanted to find his love. I recommended you all. It's not the best movie ever, but it was great!
