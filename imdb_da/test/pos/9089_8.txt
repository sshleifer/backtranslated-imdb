This movie has a particular strange setting that takes place in a school that is really old to begin with, but it doesn't really look like a sterile medical school environment. Very gothic and atmospheric. As for the film itself, okay, the assumption is a little removed, but hey, why do we see movies, not? And it is less removed than any of the waste that is out these days, that's for sure. Medical students experiment with "short-term" death, as if they were short-lived, so that they can experience what the afterlife is like. It's fine, in some cases, until parts of it come back with the tour operator and begin to interfere in their earthly life. I hadn't seen this movie this year until I got it on DVD and I have to say I had forgotten how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks really beautiful in this movie, not as today's actresses who seem to be beautiful, but are dressed and composed as cheap hookers. Ahh, the good old days. It is nevertheless a glimpse, perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
