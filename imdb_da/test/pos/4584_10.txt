I had never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust this friend's taste so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat down to see it without knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, especially because I saw the truth in the satire. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the sense of stupidity and aura of stupidity and find idiocy to be one of the stupid movies they have seen. What these people don't seem to understand is that crass humor is there, not entertaining the audience, but showing what appeals to the morons of the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is well cast as an "average Joe." He is mainly there to be the cause of the bitter commentary on society scattered throughout this film. Many of the more fun bits are in the background, so it's easy to see several times. What makes the movie even more fun and frightening is that I see elements of it in everyday life, in people I meet or on the media. Then I go back and look at the idiocrats again and understand how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this movie can join an elite club. I want to see an ad for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient, and turn to my wife and say, "It has electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I'm saying.
