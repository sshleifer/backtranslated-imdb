STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> once heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) Comes out of jail to his bumbling jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), desperately crippling a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and slamming on the side Molly (Kim Novak.) He tries to make it big as a drummer in a band but until his big break comes together, he's stuck and doing the only thing he was good at other than being a junkie handling card in high stakes games. And try as he may, even the prison has not cured him of his dependence on the devil's substance - causing him to lie and deceive all those around him and drive him to desperate efforts to feed his habit. His longing to get out of it is his only motivation for a happy ending. When people think of Frank Sinatra, they generally think of classic high-pitched songs like Under My Skin, New York New York, and that must be you. But for no one to forget that he was actually a famous actor, and if his performance in the shelf from here to eternity was not enough, he will also be remembered for this groundbreaking drama dealing with what was at the time of the ultra-taboo subject of substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often listed as one of the first to include graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) at a time when it was a subject that was still heavily pressured underground. In his portrayal of the protagonist, Sinatra is fine and conveys the desperation, desperation and sincerity of a man who loses every second chance given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregors in Trainspotting. The first co-star to get an impression is Parker as the machine's demanding, needy cripple of a wife who uses her husband's guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. Novak as his secret lover still controls some strong moments, but is less a star than Parker. Stang does his usual cartoon help as the bumbling sidekick that tracks the leading man around with his pointed New York accent. Director Otto Preminger allows the pace to pull a bit at times, but it is still a heavily absorbing film all the way, with lots of unexpected twists and which should be admired for being one of the first movies to bring such an ugly subject so powerful for life. ****
