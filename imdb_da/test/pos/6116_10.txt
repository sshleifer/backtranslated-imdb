For all viewers out there who have smashed John Waters to make a movie like Pink Flamingos, just stop. It doesn't get you anywhere. Has anyone ever bothered to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr.Waters holds. Gathering up your best friends and making a movie just to break thousands of viewers over shows this man a great ambition within himself. Just read his biography Shock Value. It discusses the lengths he went through to finish this movie. Maybe it was not just the fact that John made this movie to brutal people, it was to prove that there might be something bad good taste>
