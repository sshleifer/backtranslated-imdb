Although I totally agree with the previous commentary on Toni Servilly's amazing play as Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful film and montage that makes this movie almost a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with various types of camera techniques that reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. They both used the same MTV style film combined with modern (alternative / techno) music, which made the film ?? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - separate from the other crime / mafia films in its genre. Although the movie can begin with very slowly almost "sec" compared to the faster Hollywood productions, it should be enjoyed the reason for its serenity, wonderful character portrait and stunning ending. Definitely a must see for people who enjoy the European / Italian cinema. PS Toni continues to act like this, we need an encore.
