An exquisite movie. They just don't make them like this anymore! We cancel an upper middle class family in Dublin in the early 20th century. They host one after Christmas dinner for their friends and family. Their table speech is just inactive chatting, but it's so well written that you are engrossed. Away from the dinner table, some fine piano games help create an intimate atmosphere as if you were one of the guests. Maybe a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added the magic of this movie. No real story, but real entertainment and an object lesson for upcoming and upcoming filmmakers.
