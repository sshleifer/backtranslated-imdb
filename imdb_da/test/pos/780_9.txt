I cannot disagree with a previous comment that "driving lessons" is more than a small one, but a man's accusation is someone else's approval, I suppose. In my book, this movie succeeds in pure charm, no small feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I don't want to wish that the story was a little less conventional considering the amount of acting in it, but the ending plot looks more like a background for character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Lady Evie is delightful over the top and above the ground actress. Although Evie has not been in constant work this year, it is unclear the last time she visited reality, if ever (think Edina from "AbFab" at 65, at some point she is even forced to tackle her kitsch factor). Some may find her annoying, but I think it's supposed to emphasize how much she pushes the reserved Ben's (Rupert Grint) buttons to force him out of his shell. Ben is as isolated from reality and lives all his life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to breathe a life into, despite being a rather one-dimensional character (you are the indulgent religious mother) . I was very impressed with Rupert Grint, who I found to give a very honest and trustworthy performance (not to mention sweet as everyone emerged), I can't think of many teenagers today, for whom I can say so. <Br /> <br /> The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evie's worlds collide. At first, Ben is understandably preliminary, but also fascinated, since Evie is essentially the opposite of everything he has ever known. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpful nature, a genuine sweetness develops between those who culminate in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first true taste of independence. The tone is consistently light even through a few short melodramatic bits, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit to the main players. All in all, if you are willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some wonderful performances, you should not disappoint. But if "sweet" is not in your movie vocabulary, it is best to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another small note, the soundtrack has music from Sufjan Stevens prominent, a good touch.
