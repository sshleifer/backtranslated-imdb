I got a chance to watch this movie at an early screening in Brea and I've been crazy about it ever since. The film is based on Shakespeare's twelfth night, which I have read and loved and seen on stage a couple of times, so I liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it doesn't matter - the movie is on it. It's super fun, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is fun and so was David Cross. In fact, the whole casting is great - I'm just a big David Cross fanatic. The shock is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few I hadn't heard before, but I know they have a CD that comes out, so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!
