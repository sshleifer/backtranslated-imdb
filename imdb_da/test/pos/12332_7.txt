I was a little surprised at the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly would not have my children see this. I think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old. <br /> <br /> Plot: A girl who tries to fit in the click gets mocked and plagued by 'in the crowd'. They talk about her staying in this gruesome mausoleum (reminding me of Phantasm ...) and they continue to plague her at night. They know a newly deceased clairvoyant comes back to life and raises the dead around them! It sounds terribly cheesy, but given the age and budget, which was undoubtedly quite small, this movie is fun at many levels. <br /> <br /> Look for an early EG Daily as one of the crowd brats. I enjoyed it and it scared my boyfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 children.
