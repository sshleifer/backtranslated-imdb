I loved this movie, but then again I'm a big Cronenberg fan. If you haven't seen a David Cronenberg movie, this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this out. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive gaming phenomenon a step further. <br /> <br /> In this game, players put a bio-manipulated game pad through a jack inserted into the spinal cord and enter the game directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot, but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget. It's filled with Cronenberg's slimy body works, dark fake scenes, all populated by a huge caste, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, who take the situation they find themselves very serious. These people will do what they can to figure out the game and then win on it. Like other movies of his, there is no lack of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat, but as an auto accident you do not look away. If you liked any of the above movies, then go out and get it here.
