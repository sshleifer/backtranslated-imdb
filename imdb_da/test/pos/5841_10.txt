I have never seen a show with so much history, mystery, excitement and thrilling excitement before. I'm building on television longer, but I own every season of this show and it's great. Each episode is extremely well-functioning, written and plotted. At the end of the show, I felt the stories were too chopped to be in a prison, but the actors pulled it off. Sopranos suck large compared to OZ. In fact, any show that is on a cable network, HBO or not just can hold a light to the OZ. I wish it would come back for another season. If that happened, they would probably kill all the signs on the show, but hey, we all have to go sometime. As far as the characters are concerned, I would say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories I thought were the strongest of anyone, except Beechers of course, but still ... anyway, best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!
