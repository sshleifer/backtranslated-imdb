Up and Coming was a very positive sitcom that brought a tool / channel that opened the young minds of the black culture. Focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people and hope for change. I recommend this choice for all US households to experience the struggle and reward. The show never got the chance to flourish into the idea of ​​middle-class black becoming business owners of their own. The problem was so compatible with the reality situation that it has affected the lives of so many. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put DVDs to Americans to enjoy with their families. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
