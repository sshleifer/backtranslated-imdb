It's a talk, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I've seen the first and second episode. The artwork and the animation fit very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is a gun drawing, badge wearing, a pair of shot cheeks, shooting on it, which he believes to be offensive or "guilty". So far, the episodes have had simple and subsequent plots that work very well with Assy's studies. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, is the soothing retort for Assy's A.A. antics and random "I have a hunch" lead. Assys lines are very funny and clever, here is one for example: "I have a ball and it has your email address on it, don't let me send" * bang * "looks like your in-box just got some new mail. "The thinking box at Assy Mcgee's headquarters is so far, consistent and cue. As for the sound, it is perfect, the sound effects and the voice work is 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone all boozed up, Don Sanchez, the mayor, police officer, everyone has voices that "fit" that personas very well. I recommend it to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before going to bed as it makes air on adults swim Sunday evenings. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10.10
