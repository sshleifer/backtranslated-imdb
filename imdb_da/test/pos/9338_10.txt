Without a doubt this is the big momma of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos, which are either "dance videos" poorly stored and / or badly interrupted texts, it was done right. Jackson co-authored and choreographed the VH1 and directed this masterpiece. In fact, one can say that Thriller is scary, so most horror movies with the last second sparkling eye. For me, this music video is what you judge all other music videos on. You can easily see the vicious influence, M.J. had early breakdancing with the zombie march number. Because of the dance, comedy, storyline and yes horror. I give it a 5 out of 5.
