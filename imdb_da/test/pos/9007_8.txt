The new voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to pass any frickkin's academy to become emperor again! It's the same again and again, right? This is a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. He teaches a lesson. Everything is the same !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back ... * sniffle *! Nothing changes because Disney won't do anything. It's probably one of the most delayed shows ever! The first movie was so marvelously better! Malina is probably the only one I like. Kuzco is such a crybaby! Kronk is retarded! And Yzma's retarded-ER (if even a word)! What I meant to say is ... How could you, Disney ... why?
