This is one of the classic Americans made for television movies just made to look at a rainy afternoon. Although the manuscript is extremely unlikely, it never takes itself too seriously, and it does not throw, leading to a big tongue in the cheek's murderous mystery / horror movie that is best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or chocolate box. A great bonus to this movie is the great place to film and, despite the strange exits and even strangers around Lake Tommahawk, I wouldn't mind living there! <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie to watch over and over again.
