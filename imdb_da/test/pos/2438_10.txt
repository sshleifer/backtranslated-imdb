Well, I don't know much about anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple and cordial. In other words, it was all it should be. The story is about a girl's first love, as I say, and I should definitely warn you: Don't expect anything challenging or provocative in terms of it. I mean, it's a children's cartoon. It is really just a simple story, but it is well told and it keeps you alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's short, it's fun, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
