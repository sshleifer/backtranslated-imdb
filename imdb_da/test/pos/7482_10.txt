I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it, but I thought it had Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it, and came to find out that it was not Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane who was amazing this movie. I love that almost the whole movie is in this suburb. The characters were great all together, and the manuscript was amazing. I really wish Skip Woods would write and lead another movie. In my book Thursday is the flawless story about this guy who tries to make the wife and the child after a shady past, but then his old drug dealer comes up and it gets completely Thursday. This is one of my favorite films, and it shows some real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I found it in a couple of Hollywood videos on VHS. Then dust out the old VCR and pop in Thursday because it gets the Pee Wees approval mark
