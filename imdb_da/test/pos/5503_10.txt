A very different Jerry Lewis movie, not like all the more famous movies everyone knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and national socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very American way. And, as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, un-American means more sophisticated, more subtle, more intelligent or simply better. That is why the film was not successful in the United States, but a great success in Europe. All in all, Jerry Lewis has shown by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.
