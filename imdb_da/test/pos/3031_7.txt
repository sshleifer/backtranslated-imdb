'The Cell' is a journey in a serial killer's thoughts, and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, whether the world it shows during this journey does not mean the journey is real. In my opinion, this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images that other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. It doesn't work that way, but it looks like the virtual reality. She and other researchers, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method can work. Catherine enters the boy and talks to him in a world entirely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that ultimately yield results. <br /> <br /> The right story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears, and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems arise. 1. Carl went straight into the coma he has been ill for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. That way, this part of the story is quite standard. <br /> <br /> Things are getting interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenia and a serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; she could die in Carl's mind. A bond on how the last victim was killed, a fate that this girl will have for about twenty hours, will make Catherine try to get the location out of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this movie more than worth seeing. Director Tarsem Singh, who made music videos before this, somehow goes back to these music videos. Each room in the imaginative world is another card clip that consists of beautiful and sometimes joking images. For me, the visual style felt brand new, as "Three Kings" had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you a movie, 'The Cell' won't disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre like this movie anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for it. I think you have to be a little open, of course there are not (yet) events in our real world. Still a very entertaining movie with great ideas that look great.
