(r # 88) Brilliant, very entertaining show with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles must see this. CGI blends very well with the environment and it's just fun to see these giants walking around their daily business as randomly as on the Discovery Channel. This show was a brilliant blow and it blows its followers "Walking with animals" and "The future is wild" out of the water. The biggest episode was definitely the last one to see the last days of Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteoric strike that became their death. This thing is almost too great for television. What about a theatrical release? I would pay something to see these dinos in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that is spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, it's for you. Dinosaurs have never been cooler.
