The film, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was excellently made. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - a former stage singer, and their young son-my guess is about 10 years traveling through Morroco for leisure. On the bus they encounter a French government agent and they are a little too nice to him. He is killed in the market after finding out the information he was looking for. He wants to carry this information out to anyone so he goes to the only person he even knows a little: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because this is where his son is, and the assasination that the agent told him would be. The film is very exciting. There are many twists (typically Hitchcock films). It also has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all that, it won an Oscar for Doris Day's performance of "Que Sarah, Sarah." This movie is very good. It's hard to find a problem about it. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all the fans. I give this movie an "A-" only because it is a little predictable.
