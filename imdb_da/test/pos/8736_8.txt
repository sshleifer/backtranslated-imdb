I discovered this late one night at Turner Classics. I continued to say to myself, "I will turn it off as soon as it stops being fun," but it is superfluous to say I saw it all the way. <br /> <br /> I'm a movie junkie, but I never even heard of this movie (or if I did in 1971, I forgot). It is worth seeing just for the performance of Goldie Hawn as the tart-tongued ing√©nue. Her acting is a revelation in this movie. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a clever script?), But her acting is extraordinary. I never understood how fun Goldie could be and it makes her later plays in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a little sad. In her later career, she is far too over-the-top in terms of her minimalist, wickedly fun look here. It is a pleasure to see young Matthau, the great Bergman and the star-supporting cast, but it is Goldie Hawn who will make this movie worth seeing again.
