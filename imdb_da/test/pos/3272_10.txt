I remember catching this movie on a C4 screen a year ago, and I was totally blown away by it all. I thought the movie managed to represent such a variety of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime and so many more. I was hooked on it all for a moment or so and was really worried about the signs. It made me feel scared for a second for Jimmy, and then I got to laugh at gangsters in the next ... and all the time I had my fingers crossed that things would work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are amazing, Bryan Brown is absolute quality and made me clap with David Field, who was fun as well as being a bad git. When I watched this movie I was able to order it on DVD, and as a result, any person I show it gets connected much in the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy night, and it is one that you can really appreciate with your friends.
