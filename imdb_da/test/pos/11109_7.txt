I had always wanted to watch this movie, and the first three quarters turned out that I hadn't waited in vain. But what happened in the end? I mean, don't understand me, I liked the movie. It made me absolutely nostalgic for the realistic, unique NYC of the 80s that we've lost thanks to Giuliani. But it still lacks half an hour!
