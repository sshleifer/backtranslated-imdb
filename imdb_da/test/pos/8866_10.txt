"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, you would just attack me right now, so some of you are still people. This thing won't show itself, it'll hide inside an imitation. It will struggle if it should, but it is vulnerable in the open. If it takes us over, it has no more enemies, no one left to kill it, and then it is won. "<br /> < John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made ?? fast, smart and clean exciting from start to finish. It is so that all the films in the genre must be made. <br /> <br /> In 1982, the film focused on Antarctica, and the film focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We get no introduction to their mission, but are highlighted in their existence when a couple of apparently crazy Norwegians look at their basil and are chasing a fledged dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy. It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a form-changing foreign organism, which manifests itself in the physical form of its victims ?? In other words, it begins to eat the Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining people cannot distinguish the difference between their friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> The suite of researchers, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If Thing really is among them, how do they start revealing it? How many things are there? How can Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed?) <br /> <br /> The origin of the creature in the film is easily explained: Thirty thousand years ago, a spacecraft shot to the ground and was frozen in the Antarctic. Thingen tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unconsciously released it from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing", the movie itself, resembles Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien" (1979). Many comparisons have been made ?? The protagonists are stranded in a deserted area stalked by a rarely seen enemy who manages to kill them one by one. But "The Thing" ?? for all practical purposes ?? come first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (write under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a self-production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was "The Thing From Another World", an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it has a little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake makes it more justice. <br /> <br /> The idea that Thingen is able to adapt physical properties to anyone is what really makes this movie so amazing and is the most crucial link to the short story. In 1951, the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably depict the shifting organism, but 31 years led many advances in SFX. <br /> <br /> Creature Effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could easily become a cheesy gore feast in a revolting scary (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. Thingen, although it never takes a particular form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply excellent. They still pack a battle twenty-two years later. Ennio Morricones scored (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, yet wasted when used correctly. <Br /> From the fact that its caste consists solely of men, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions from all the time, "The Thing" ?? by any standards ?? is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters and "E.T." ?? released the same year and featuring a very cheeky alien ?? In the long run, "The Thing" is superior in almost every imaginable way. Spielberg's story is outdated and flopped during his 20th anniversary journey. "Thing" on the other hand has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics ?? It is one of the most famous non-famous films ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is notorious for having a very bumpy career ?? from his amazing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and stupid "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his very best movie. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorable enough to land it on most "great movies" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? by close inspection ?? masterfully designed. It's a bold and brilliant thrill ride that is unique and chilling at the same time? a real relief for movie buffs that are tired of the same old horror tracks. This, at least, is really unpredictable.
