I took a group of young people who were of the same age as the protagonists, and it appealed to us all. I agree with the second post, the Wilson guy worked a thankless script to a much smaller character. It's good to have a movie for a certain age demographic (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in secondary school. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet did as the cool teacher. He kept us adults awake. The level of children's questioning authority was kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. Rebel. The setting and music were beautiful. Overall, if you enjoyed Holes, it really is the same.
