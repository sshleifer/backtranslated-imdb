It is not hard to imagine what the main problem for a scriptwriter is to have 18 equally well-written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that lasts about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes, and that's also what author director Ralf Westhoff is doing here. Very few of the characters can be recognized as humans as you and I know in real life, many of them are only characterized by two or three attributes and remain vague. I realize it, but still believe that the "Shop" is successful, that it does whatever it wants. It is a movie with very well-written dialogue, extremely good acting and a movie that made me laugh loudly, really often. I don't think this movie wants to make an in-depth analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it will be moral commentary on speed dating. It's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Fun and entertaining.
