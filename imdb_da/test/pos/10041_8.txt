Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood of the West, struggling with military bureaucracy, confederates, Native Americans and carpetbags business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end. Not to mention the always reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to link this story with the facts and the real people, it doesn't work. Just enjoy it because no one has ever claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn worked together.
