Six teenagers go to an old distant abandoned school, where 27 years ago a terrible massacre took place for one night with fun and pranks. Instead, the kids run out of the vicious mad security guard (very well played with the extremely eerie threat of Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed the unpleasant killings. Director Carlos Gil tells the fascinating story at a rapid pace and does a good job of creating a compelling ghostly and mysterious atmosphere. Witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a smart and inspired mix of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing at the end. The smooth filmography of Fernando Arribas makes expert use of light and shade. David San Jose's humorous score does the same. The attractive and appealing young cast gives all the lively and engaging performances, with Carlos Fuente's particularly commendable tours as starring Ramon, Olivia Molina panicking Maria, Zoe Berriatua as unpleasant joker Jordi and Carmen Morales as spunky Goth chick Sandra. The murder set pieces are just as bloody and brutal as they should be. Outstanding whammy of a surprise dark ending too. A solid and satisfying shocker.
