<br /> <br /> "Let's switch Murders - your wife, my father" - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines as they meet for lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid and respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife, flirting Miriam, will not divorce him so he can marry Senator's daughter Anne, laughing the whole conversation as a joke. The following week, he no longer laughs. In a scene with classic Hitchcock excitement, Bruno Miriam closes through a carnival and strings her. As he does, the glasses fall away and we see the murder frankly reflected twice through her lenses. Cold-hearted and amorous Bruno, his part of the deal is over, is approaching a horrible Guy who expects, even pushing him to "do his bit". Cases are not helped when Anne's perishable and incredible younger sister turns out to lose Guy of Miriam's murder. So accused of a murder he did not commit and expected to commit another, what should Guy do? The power of this movie is in the presentation of people as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock makes perfect.
