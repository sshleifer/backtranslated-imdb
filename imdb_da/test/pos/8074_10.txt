I watched this movie twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best picture prize). <br /> <br /> As a silent cinematographer, I am interested in modern films that quote or recreate the yesteryear library language. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the film refers directly to Lang's Metropolis, and his plotter's allegorical-parabolic character. But I didn't see Murnau in it. However, there is a more obvious Melies tribute: the moon with a human face (here cigar-raising) and the paper-made, painted mountains and urban landscapes. I enjoyed the movie most for their pictures, and in the meantime, I found the story of muteness and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless cities very interesting. From this perspective, this film is a unique reflection on the silent bios muted, because in the quiet period one can hardly find stories with silent figures. In this case, one can question whether the story of the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or there is an intention to play on the maturity of the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflection I found in Guy Maddins caution where the inhabitants of a mountain village have limitations on using their voices. I intend to write a paper about it, if you know movies related to this topic, let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's movie to all movie galleries (one of the critics called it: the festival). PS: The winners were announced and the film won the award for best movie!
