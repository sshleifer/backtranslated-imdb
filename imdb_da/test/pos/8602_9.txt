I did not really focus on the larger genocidal aspects of history (although the terrible images at the beginning are very powerful). I was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you. I was really wrenching to see Yasuko being rejected as "defiled" by the bomb. The image that stays the most for me is when Yasuko is standing in front of the mirror, fighting the hair, quietly and clearly it looks in lumps.
