Got this the second day from the creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine while the family stopped in a hotel, had never heard of it. After reading it was filmed at Balmedie Beach, I just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the movie all the time while they were living in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> 1st away I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan (baring Star Wars) I really just wanted to see what they had done with this movie location, I was currently surprised. This did not prove to be a standard Sci-Fi, more like a mix of sci-fi and survival fear. Had a good story that was different, had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with Â£ 8000. Action was better than the average for a low budget movie. The way they have edited across the coastline to make it feel that the dry desert plan they are on was nice. <br /> <br /> Weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were sweet like predators in the invisible state. <br /> <br /> All in all, I want to buy future releases from these guys, maybe another horror next (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very informative about giving background to the producers, I would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next DVD release. Excellent work keep it up
