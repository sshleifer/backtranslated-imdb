I was a projectionist while in the United States. And remember this movie very well. we had just been created with Stereo Sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. Instructions came with the wheels. the overture played while the projected curtain image was closed, and I followed with the theater curtain closed too. for a break the theater curtain was closed, and after five minutes I restarted the film with the projection curtain closed, while music was used as a curtain call to the second part. Being the first stereo movie I had ever seen and been such a great musical production, I have certainly enjoyed watching it every time I showed it to the run.
