When I read synopsis - 3 people lost in nature fighting against a huge crocodile - I was not just pulled in. It sounded like the typical geese movie scare formula for a bunch of people stolen by a monster - except in this case there are only three of them, so we wouldn't even get the macabre 'joy' to see that they were picked up by one after one. <br /> <br /> But I saw it (couldn't sleep, nothing else to do) and it turned out to be much better than expected. The action is amazing, the atmosphere thrilled, and you really get the rare feeling of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror as it should be done. First-class filmmaking. It's not perfect, but it's worth seeing. I give it a 7.
