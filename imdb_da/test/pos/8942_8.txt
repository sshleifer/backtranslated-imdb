Wales seems to show some ghost movies recently. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw very much Annie Mary, who I thought was very good. But plots with a view is not only quirky, it laughs a lot of fun, has a lot of amazing talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is great) and a plot that is not entirely original is so wisely written that one always pleasantly picks up what Almost can be throwaway lines. That was the kind of movie I wanted to see again immediately, it was over, and one of the few I actually wanted to own. Although many of the characters are caricatures and you must have been in a Welsh village to understand it, they are also very human and the report between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to see.
