I'm afraid I will have to add my name to the long list of people who stay flabbergastede that this movie has not yet been released (Sept 2007) on DVD. It is one of the mysteries that makes the mind skewed, especially when considering the amount of DVDs available today that contain material that should have been many years ago. I still have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my qualm is more of a principle than a frustration of not being able to see the movie. With regard to the film itself, this is an excellent all-round with good picture quality, more than satisfying soundtrack, lively plot with excitement, feeling, sadness, frustration, feeling of good and exotic surroundings (for Europeans). How true the movie fits into reality in Burma, I have no idea it is actually less important, the key is that it is entertaining, it is a success. You will soon be attached to each of the main characters, and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the last passage-the-river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries like Burma, and this film at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events to occur later this month seem to respond to this question with a resounding "No", and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the monks' lives, let alone women or children!
