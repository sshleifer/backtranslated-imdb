It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us into the trials with a group of American American scientists who gave a high mission during World War II: beat everyone else to the atomic bomb. Sequestered in a heavily guarded New Mexico composition, brainiacs slowly burn the idea from ambitious concept to immense reality. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that requires your close attention. It is a real-thinking person's film, not only from the scientific aspect of developing an apparently impossible weapon, but also the moral consequences of helping to kill on a massive scale. Signs are constantly torn between the reality and their duty of war as Americans. The film is never sermon about, but gives us freedom to wonder about the enormous inner turmoil these men face. The performances also deserve special mention. Paul Newman delivers one of his great, underestimated performances as Pattonesque general responsible for delivering the ultimate big stick to Allied forces. Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY lose much of their traction, it is unnecessarily romantic component. Dwight Schultz as head of the scientific team is struggling with his feelings for his family and his relentless occupation with his big project. Director Roland Joffe obviously felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. In addition, it is the interaction between the researchers and their military hierarchy that gives us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. However, it is hard not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face on one of the most exciting stories in human history.
