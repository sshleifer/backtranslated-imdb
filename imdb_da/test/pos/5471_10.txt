I'm from Texas and my family vacationed a few years ago to Sante Fe with my brother. He suggested that we go to see the church with the stairs. I was absolutely blown away by the miracles that took place there. The movie is amazing - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It's amazing, absolutely fantastic. If you haven't seen the stairs personally, it's worth the trip to see it. The tree is beautiful and the architecture is amazing. Just being in the chapel gives me goose bids! To read about the chapel history and then to see its beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's amazing! Then see the stairs personally!
