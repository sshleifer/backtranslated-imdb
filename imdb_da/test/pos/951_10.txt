if you haven't seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go see it. wow. its devastating fun. I don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are lots of hot guys in this one, look for someone who calls Velu "Maacha". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are also brilliant. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Look, you won't regret it. There are some good laughs in this. If you don't speak Tamil, learn it. Then you get all the inside jokes. It's one for the whole family, except perhaps the violent bits should be skipped. I've seen this movie about eleven times .... and counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
