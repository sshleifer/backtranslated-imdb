Wicked Little things were a really good movie. I would say in some parts, it seemed really incredible, and others seemed to be as though it wasn't enough to think about putting into action the characters, but in general it was exciting and entertaining. do not understand why this film's rating is so low. I don't understand why all the Afterdark Horrorfest movie reviews are so low. These are B-movie people and no more. They provide good entertainment and most of them do not have many mistakes at all. It is definitely worth a visit because you will not be disappointed with the result. Wicked Little Things is one of the best 1st annual Afterdark Horrorfest movies and compared to many other movies in the series, this is one of the best superiors.
