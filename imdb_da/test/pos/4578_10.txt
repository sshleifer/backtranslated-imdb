I like money! I stumbled upon this brilliant movie in a local video store last week. Wasn't sure what to expect. Bringing it home, picking up the player and then my journey started into stupidity. The first impression I made was very chuckling, no laughing loudly. It wasn't until the second view the movie really started to address me and humor was so much more fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers, first to see it was okay, so the right fun started telling people about it, just talking about each scene and setup. I make all my friends see this movie, everyone I know. This movie may well be one of the most accurate "Future" movies ever made. This movie is more than 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization. Mike Dommer, the amazing mind that brought us Office Space, has given us a vision of life in the automated future. Luke Wilson's dead pan humor as "Average" Joe improved the movie so much more. Watch this movie, so when you're done, read more! Write more! Think more! For the sake of the future, if not for your own!
