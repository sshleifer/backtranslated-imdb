A unique blend of musical, film noir and comedy - with a few sex scenes cast on a good scale. The only other movie I can think of with a rather uniform wild and madcap mix of themes and clichés is the French movie Billy Ze Kick - but it has a more surreal and quirky approach. <br /> <br /> Not that this movie wouldn't be surreal or quirky. The humor is sometimes quite subtle, at other times obviously in your face - and often exceeds the limit of offense. To give an example: In the post-coital chit chat with a prostitute, our hero Max Müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder by using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a saying. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of movies with fun sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (while I want more) - while the song perfectly supports the action, changing the meaning of its words a few times and expressing an end to Larry's inability to provide additional service. The movie's greatest love scene between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks such a subtlety - these are stubborn things, especially when Bettina sang slowly violating the moan, of course everything in the music's rhythm. <br /> <br /> Inevitable unless you are one of the fake ones.
