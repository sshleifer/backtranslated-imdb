Kramer vs Kramer is a movie to hold onto and not forget. It's not one of the most popular movies ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best movie films, but that doesn't mean it's still not important. I thought the movie was well done and made you see more and more of it. The performance was the best positive for the movie, and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he has ever done as the lonely work collector who will take care of his son as his wife differs from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great achievement with Meryl Streep, who played Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10 but manages to make the movie worth seeing and appreciating. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best movies ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeens Outlook: 9/10 *** + A-
