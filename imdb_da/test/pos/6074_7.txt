The English patient is one of the films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say the most because this movie, although very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers from some disadvantages. First of all, why, oh why are the modern movies so long? This lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really difficult to concentrate and follow the very serious plot. I say if the movie was an hour shorter, it would only serve it well. But we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful dissertation of human soul, love and fraud, war and cowardice, violence and courage. Ralph Fiennes is a fantastic super actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready to save his lover's life only. He is amazing, even though half of the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is, as usual, very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot to her excellent game and love story with the Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and very strong. And then there is desert in Egypt, then there are deep, cloudless skies, green groves in Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here too. It is obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, so naked bodies, infidelity and everything. I don't know what to say. So much of a fantastic actor's work, so much of realism, so much brutality that the war brings. This is not a movie for relaxation. It makes you think.
