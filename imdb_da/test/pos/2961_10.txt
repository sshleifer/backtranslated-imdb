Back then in the states I was about 7 or 8, I always woke up early, just to see this along with a whole bunch of other comics like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But it was perhaps one of the most memorable and fun animated works out there, and I still find it very fun today, I will never forget the episodes, like the one where two earthquakes fought over the cane of chocolate pudding? or the one in which the earthwater is trying to reach the island where all the ants are, and my personal favorite, the one where the bog, the wagon and a dog end up in an animal hospital which will later be the basis of a similar Looney Toon cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and bulldog. This is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there that anyone would love to regain, I would. An excellent series.
