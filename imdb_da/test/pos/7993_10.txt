I've had this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever since then, but the real difference is that THIS movie doesn't date when I grew up. I noticed a few scenes in this movie that had no meaning like: 'Hhmm ... the audience is angry. Hi! Where did they get these tomatoes from? "Then I thought," who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! "The original Tim Burton Batman was also good, but it was a bit cheesy on some parts and I didn't like all the actors. almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no involvement with prince. <br /> <br /> Today, many fans of Christopher Nolan movies, which Burton claims the Nolan films are more serious and therefore fail more loyal to the comics, I do not think it is true: -It has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman, who was a revenge criminal criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years looking in his silliness in the 60s (and a bit with Batman & Robin) .A director can freely choose what kind of Batman he has to imagine for so long, if it is good. is about a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears, Burton managed to create a perfect balance between silliness and darkness around the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched the Nolan movies and I love them too (especially The Dark Knight). There is simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth, and he sought an explanation for almost every aspect of Batman. It's a little too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton films are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. My conclusion is that you should not compare Nolan with the Burton movies. They are just different and it is up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.
