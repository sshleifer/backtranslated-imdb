Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India known for his choice of subjects for film and the strength of his scripts. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. A faithful adaptation of the Nobel Laureate Tagore's novel on the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, gives the director a new dimension to the highly acclaimed and controversial work.
