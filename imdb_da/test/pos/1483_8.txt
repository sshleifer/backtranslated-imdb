There was once a person in my family (not to say who it is for personal reasons) who believes that Mr. Bean is always so stupid in what he does on the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at the time. Shocked immediately. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one why I love to see Mr Bean. Being one of the earliest shows on the local television here in my country, where I first grew up watching, is just one of the things that had put me in the head. There were even my friends, and I talked about a few of the selected episodes and we just laughed. <br /> <br /> No matter how Rowan Atkinson, like Mr. Bean, will do in every episode, it's always stupid, fun, and fun. Although it can sometimes show some of the repetitions here, it has never been possible to bring back my childhood memories. In fact, I dare say this is the very first show that introduces me to the kind of shows coming out of the UK when I grew up. The comedy series ... certainly malicious as the British might say.
