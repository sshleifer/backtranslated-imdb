Now before people start to get a breakdown on this movie (those who play rugby anyway) it's a movie! It has made Hollywood treatment entertain people, and therefore those who play rugby (even included) will naturally choose holes in the choreography of the game in the movie. Althogether is a decent movie and draws attention to the morals and ideas behind the rugby game. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a real team, a real trainer and his work that helps guide the kids in the right direction to be better people in the future and is also based on real people who have played for the highland team. It is just a typical sports film with a character that is misunderstood and eventually finds its way on the right track again through the rugby medium in this case. Is generally a sensitive movie that is fun, but has errors in terms of portrayal of the game. But as I said, this is a movie during Hollywood treatment.
