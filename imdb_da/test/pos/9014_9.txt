While I realized that this show is too strange to please everyone, I can't figure out where all these bad reviews come from, and I'm most surprised at the bad reviews it has received from fans of the movies. I liked it and got hooked on it since the first episode I watched. However, it is a bit messy that Kuzco was put in school. And it seems to be high school rather than college. But I think he's only eighteen, right, so it's not like he's too old to be educated? And haven't the kings always had the best education available to them? So "Kuzco must graduate or he won't be emperor" things don't sound too strange to me. And I suppose his education was neglected before, so he must be educated now.
