I don't cry easily over movies, but I have to admit that this brings me to tears. Although I'm not an Ms. Streep fan, her performance was excellent. The title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is. In the first hour I didn't like any of the characters, but it changed as the movie continued. The film also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. One should watch movies.
