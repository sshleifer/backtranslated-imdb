This movie could be compared to "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie. So many parts of it are so fun and so many parts are so heartbreaking. It's not perfect in its production or even its dialogue, but the story is unique, which says a lot to modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is boring at best, but Heather Graham does an excellent job in my opinion. Try it - despite the trite-looking DVD cover. The character of Joline brings many problems into our self-service culture. She asks us if engagement is really for the other person or ourselves. It really is us. Following through on promises (anywhere from marriage to an affair for a friend) is a good feeling. Yet, our words are nothing but a changing puff of smoke. Joline is like a wake-up call. We must be aware of our words and obligations, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we must not commit ourselves to anyone who is unable to do the same.
