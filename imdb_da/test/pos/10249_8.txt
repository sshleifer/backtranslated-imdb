On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a creeping ensemble comedy masking as a period (seen in the early 60s, complete with a flawless Motown soundtrack). But there is so much more to this movie - it gets better every time I see it. The casting of unknowns (at that time) is excellent, and it is remarkable as a completely black-cast film that does not fall into any Blaxpoitation clich√©s - sometimes COOLEY HIGH feels almost like an updated, urban neo-realistic movie , with much pointed humor added. At times, it shows quite a tight budget, but the limitations actually serve the film well - there is a laugh and honesty of emotions here that gives the film an immediate shortage in most similar-minded films (such as Schultz's later CAR WASH, which was more popular, but essentially meaningless) Warm-hearted, but also true to life, it may be one of the sleeping in the 70's - celebrated at that time, it seems to get filmfreaks at this here today. Their loss - this is a nice, fine movie. Bare-bones pan-and-scan DVD (no widescreen!?!) Is testament to how little caring - this excellent movie is.
