This DVD set is the complete widescreen 15-episode round of "Surface", a TV show made by Universal in 2006. The full play time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus a few bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects featurette). This was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it the screen in terms of quality production design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 10+ hours are a lot of time, and typically with this type of thing, the overall quality begins to fall in the later episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (Discs 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the rest a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seems that they were surprised by the success of the series and could not cope well with subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for further episodes. It even seems that additional authors were brought in to the later episodes, because the characters (which were already the weakest part of the series) lacked consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes. The series was canceled, and although the last episode gives a number of conclusions, there are still many things left. <br /> <br /> It's basically a science fiction story of genetically created dragons; kind of TV mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as a puzzle when a crew Navy sub is found adrift at sea, sailors on a Texas lake are sucked in whirlpool, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. Etc. And as long as things remain this vague there is a fair amount of tension and tension. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one in the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a marine biologist from California who discovers a strange creature rising from an underwater thermal vent on the seabed. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) shows up with his younger brother in the Gulf when a similar creature pulls his brother away (never to be seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. He takes a home where it closes in an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic impulses, causing lightning strikes, emptying the sea of ​​the fish and reproducing as a bunch of striped rabbits as they find an underwater thermal vent of boiling water. As long as it is uncertain whether they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the premise is interesting. When you begin to suspect their origin, it becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (a dizzying bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff) plays essentially the Richard Dreyfuss character from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" so you know it with a better actor and a better director could have been an interesting character. You will grow to hate this character more with each episode. Unfortunately, what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon condensed into two, as Ferguson and Bell (soon to be the low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) soon mated and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as unlikely as things "Jason Bourne" gets into in You expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (it may even be part of the fun), but their adventure is not just totally incredible, they are complete and totally boring. There are three consecutive episodes that have Ferguson and Bell together in an immersion that wants you longing for the excitement of a daily actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the casting, and the segments with his pet clothing (Nimrod) are often cut with the boring Ferguson Bell stuff to keep you in mind. And these segments benefit from the presence of the beautiful Leighton Meester (the latest "Gossip Girl" fame) as his sister Savannah. Apparently, the producers fetched the meaning of this for their "teen boy" audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "first love" interest in Miles. As Savannah's screen time drops, Catlin is gradually phased in. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third story to keep viewers sufficiently engaged, and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of another group of young actors. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
