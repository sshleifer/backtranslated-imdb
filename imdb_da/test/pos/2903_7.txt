I would give this movie high marks for cinema photography and performances. I just read a user comment about the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan like fleeces Sinuoeh, the protagonist. I remember a mini-biography of this actress after the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French man and wife in the film industry, taken with his extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also excellent in this movie. Like other neo-biblical films from the 1940s and 50s, "The Egyptian" reflects the morals and values ​​of that time, but is still good entertainment because the show is amazing and the story so well told.
