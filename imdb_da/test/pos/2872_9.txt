Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time this year that I had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror buff and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty gory. I'm not a big wrestling fan, but Kane really pulled the whole monster stuff away. I have to admit that I wouldn't watch this movie, my 17-year-old dragged me to it, but I'm very happy about it. During and after the movie I looked over my shoulder. I agree with others that the whole recovery movie is enough. Therefore, I think this movie gets some good reviews. It's a refreshing change and takes you back to The Texas Chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no CGI crap.
