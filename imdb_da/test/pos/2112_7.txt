I've seen Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. Watching a G-rated movie is refreshing. This is a good movie. The story is mainly from the view of the children. The interaction between the children and the adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you liked Little Rascals, you'll probably enjoy this. I've seen this movie on cable. Either on the Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would have gone to see at the theater. But I only go to the theater for the effects of the big screen, so most of the comedies, romantic films or dramas I do not go on the big screen - I am waiting for the TV / cable edition. Get your kids together, pop some popcorn and enjoy it!
