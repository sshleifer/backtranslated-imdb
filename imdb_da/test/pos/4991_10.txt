I am very impressed with the actor in Comanche Moon. Before I began to see this, I didn't expect to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It blew my heart how well they played every role! This was, in my opinion, almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It's hard to compare any movie to Lonesome Dove. If you didn't make that comparison, I'd give it a thumbs up. It was very entertaining! I don't put many comments on this page, but I just felt that I had to get my opinion out there. Amazing! I don't want to go out and name every actor who was brilliant because I would probably list every one. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on his head and played captain Gus. His mannerisms were perfect.
