A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealistic collection. Recommended view for those who like their movie complicated. My interpretation of the 'strange' end would be that Andrew's journey ends in hell. He does not like the gentle consumption-controlled emptiness of the purgatory; a kind of "living", but not progressing, that is, not getting anywhere - even the city's railways do not stop at the stations. It has a Metro system as if you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board these trains. He is incapable of reaching a fragrant, sensuous sky, and is starting to continue his bus journey to his final destination. The old northern version of Hell (Hades, NOT Hell the Earth City) does not burn hot as the British version, it is cold, freezing, Niflheim's land (land of cold and fog). This seems to be where Andreas ends, just without accessing the sky through that tunnel.
