I remember seeing an elizabeth montgomery movie when I was maybe 5 years old (if that) and to this day I can remember this movie (in just small and small). It was the movie, I remembered everything throughout my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the part of history, and the house is constantly dark. The main part that was the most freaky for me was Elizabeth, who walked around the house all dark, and then someone was in the field outside. At that time I thought I was an old witch, but the memory is now wild, so I can't really remember who it was, but it was someone in a field outside lurking ... and that part is what struck me most of the time. I really wish I could see this movie again. If anyone knows how to get a copy, please contact me at valid908@yahoo.com
