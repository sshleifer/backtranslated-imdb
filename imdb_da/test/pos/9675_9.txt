> This show is the only greatest thing to come out of America since The> Simpsons. Not only does it have thousands of new ideas, but it is actually controversial (see Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not afraid to "check out" people. But the great minds of Fox have canceled it with Greg the Bunny and Futurama, so make sure you buy the season 1-box set> while you still can. It will be the best money you ever spend. It is definitely a show that gets better the more you see it, which in the first place the constant flashbacks can get a little annoying and doesn't always seem to fit the story properly. But after a few episodes, you realize how brilliant it is and how well it compares to any other show in the air at the moment.
