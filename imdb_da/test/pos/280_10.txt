At the start of this movie, which I saw myself at the IFC in the early hours of the morning, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped without the opportunity to escape was so powerful that I did not know if I would continue to see ... even though it did not seem right to me that I had much of a choice, so convincing was the situation . But gradually this feeling of discomfort (even though it never completely disappeared) fell, and I felt drawn to Tessa & Bobby's assumptions and really hoping for hope that they might come together again. <br /> <br /> Really just a moving, strong story closely matches a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it before examining her trivia, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If you're lucky enough to catch it on the independent movie channel sometime or enough to find out another way to watch it.
