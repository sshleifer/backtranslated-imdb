This is a great German slasher, who is often quite exciting and creative, with a fun story and solid performances. All the characters are cool, and Benno Fürmann is great as the psycho killer, plus Franka Potente gives a great performance as the lead. It took some time to get started, but it was never boring and it had some good death scenes too, plus the music is wonderfully unsafe. I was fortunate enough to get the subtitled version instead of the dubbed, and I thought all the characters were pretty sympathetic, plus it's also very well made and written too. It has some really good plot twists as well, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the end is amazing. The final is particularly exciting, and Franka Potente was the perfect choice in my opinion, and I wish Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) was not killed so quickly because he was a really cool character. In fact, there were a few moments where I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I have to say that this movie deserved all it's praise, and although it has plot holes, it's not enough to inhibit the movie. This is a great German slasher who is often quite exciting and creative, with a fun story and solid performances, I highly recommend this one! The direction is amazing!. Stefan Ruzowitzky makes a fantastic one! Jobs here with excellent camera work, very good angles, nice close-ups (see opening scene), do a good job of adding crazy atmosphere and just keep the movie at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is little blood and gore. We get cadavers cut open, lots of very gory surgical scenes, lots of bloody stabbings, people being dissected while still conscious, separate finger, suicide, gutting is bloody wear throat, lots of evil looking frozen bodies, lots of blood and more . <br /> <br /> Acting is very solid! Franka Potente is great as the main leader, she was very sympathetic, remained cold under pressure, vulnerable, easy on her eyes, and we are able to take care of his character, the only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to ask a question poor dialogue here and there, but it was not so often she was amazing! Benno Fürmann is excellent as a psycho killer, he simply chilled and wonderfully OTT, he really gave me the cribs and was an effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, as the smart slumber I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was very sympathetic and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also on, and there was a big twist with him at the end. Holger Speckhahn was good as Idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as Prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great as David, he had a really cool character and I wish he wasn't killed so quickly. The rest of the throw makes it fine. <br /> <br /> Generally, I highly recommend this great German slasher! *** 1/2 out of 5
