For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original movie that many have said. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in Britain in 1923, just after the novel was written. As much as I would love to see the 1949 version, I would thoroughly enjoy an opportunity to watch the true original release of this story on film. <br /> <br /> Granted 1980 movie with Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields, and the two youngsters filmed with beautiful filmography. The play did not seem so good when I first watched this movie, but after seeing this a few times .... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult guidance would actually have a simplistic approach to approach live life .... whether it is in their language, appearance or daily activities. Although some have been fortunate enough to see the 1949 "Blue Lagoon", I cannot fail to wonder if anyone living there can remember the 1923 release of this story for movies.
