I do not really know when it was that television stations began to prefer to have beautiful men as their journalists - regardless of human IQs - but it was clearly a problem when "Broadcast News" came out and the movie does it right good work on it. Portrait of a love triangle between the beautiful boy, air-head reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and the producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the film draws no blow. Probably the best line in the movie is when Tom says something like, "I really don't understand what I'm reporting." And in the time of FOX News and such things, a movie like this becomes even more important. All in all, definitely a movie that I recommend. Also with Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as anchorman.
