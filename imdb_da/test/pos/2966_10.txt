I liked this movie. I wasn't quite sure what it was about before I started to see it, but enjoyed it anyway. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother did not want her to appear as she did. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is the city of a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it will be again or come out on video.
