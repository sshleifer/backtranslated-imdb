I'm not usually a drama / feel good movie kind of guy, but when I saw the trailer to "radio", I couldn't resist it. Not only is this a fantastic movie, but it also has engaging plays. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent portrait of James Robert Kennedy, a.c.a. "Radio." Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedies in it too. So for a great story, great play and a little comedy, I give "Radio" a 10 out of 10!
