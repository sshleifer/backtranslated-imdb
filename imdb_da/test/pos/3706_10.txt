Mum should really get another title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mother or with the word mother in the title. This is a very superior zombie film for so much of the waste It gets combed out time and time again, and everyone ends up immediately like any other zombie movie out there. It is so different and refreshing that it can almost categorize. <br /> <br /> The friendly old lady who takes in a creepy lodge that just happens to be a carnivorous ether that then infects the old lady who also turns into a carnivorous zombie or ghoul, quite like not precisely defined. <br /> <br /> There is pathos in history as her son realizes what she has become and initially horrified, trying to help her deliver "food." (I will not say more about this for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It is one of the 'quiet' movies as opposed to guns, explosions of rage, car crash, etc. Boring, etc., so many movies make all those The same nonsense, but still with enough moments to satisfy horror fans, as well as putting sadness into the story, along with cozy touches of humor as opposed to the silliness of some so-called "horror" films. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly good atmospheric shot at the start of the movie, where the old lady sits alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for the company and looks so innocent, but what she stays! ! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A gem of a movie and even if not your stuff, should at least be seen if only once by a true scary fan.
