I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "Annie" was a stage show I loved, but the movie was a flop. "Phantom Of The Opera movie" (and I think there were three) failed to match Weber staging. But I LOVED this. The DVD will take honor place among my "users". Although it is a movie adaptation, it is somehow captured by the mood and atmosphere of live theater. Bette Midler, always a treat, is only unique in this role. There is good music, lots of laughs and even a tear or two. I have seen most of the great musicals from the 80s and 90s. Somehow I missed this, so there is no comparison to make. But if it is revived, I will first queue for tickets! But this movie is so good, I'm in the odd position to wonder if the stage production will measure up to the movie.
