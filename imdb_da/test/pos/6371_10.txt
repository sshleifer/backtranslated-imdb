I loved Complete Savages! Why did they cancel it anyway? They should have made another season and so on ... God! They always cancel the good shows ... and leave behind all the boring things. Nothing interesting on the TV since Complete Savages are gone. This show was a good idea. A single firefighter's father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog ​​... Every one of them has his own madness in that house. TJ is always the child ... always the smaller ... Kyle's rocks! He breaks everything he touches! He is always in detention, he always does the wrong thing ... But still he is so fun of all the things he does. Sam is the wise one. He's always wild and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally he ends up dating Angela. Chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school, studying and things like that. He is always fun. And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the macho guy, the "rock star" ... But still, as crazy as everyone else. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle jimmy ... he's the man! He is like a 30 year old child. He is like doing the same stupid things that the boys do. I have always wondered how he ends up being a fireman ... And the dog is the picture of the whole Savage family. The thing is ... this show had everything to make something really big. It had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
