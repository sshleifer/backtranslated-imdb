RKS after the success of GHAYAL began working on this movie, which was a comedy film was in the making for 3 years and finally released in 1994, but did not work for some reason. Before this movie, DAMINI (93) released and did well <br /> <br /> The movie is a crazy movie like most Priyadarshan movies today, but it's fun and well-handled. The film has a decent plot unlike today's movie and makes you laugh, most characters became famous, it's the Crimean gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The movie makes you laugh all the time, even if it's for slapstick and overdone, but it's one of the funniest movies. <br /> <br /> RKS's great music is good <br /> <br /> Among actors, the Aamir steals the show and delivers its funniest performance. This was his first out comedy. Salman is fine, but watching the amateur front out of Aamir, but doing a good job and their chemistry is lovely Karisma is annoying and sounds like a child Raveena is enough Paresh Rawal is too fun in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is fun in his over the top act Shehzad Khan (called Ajit) is very good, and Viju Khote is also fun, everything is good too
