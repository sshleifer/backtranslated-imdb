"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used to make them." It's Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a newly widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits the paydirt as he seems to have another woman every night. He meets hospital patient Glenda Jackson and quickly develops a relationship with her. But it is someone who gets hard tested when she informs him that she is a one-man woman and expects him to be a woman man. <br /> <br /> This is a cute, very fun movie that also featured Art Carney as a senile hospital administrator and Richard Benjamin as Matthaus's friend and co-doctor. It's a must see for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
