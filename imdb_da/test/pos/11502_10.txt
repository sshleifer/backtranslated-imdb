This movie is amazing. Best play I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor, and of course Hilmir Snær and Bjørn Jörundur. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality about a fight for a man who has many problems and people in his life. Black humor mixed with big acting and this European art film style, it seems, it comes together in a best Icelandic film ever made. I'm telling you. "Watch this movie, you won't regret it". I gave it 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... See this
