Not the best plot in the world, but comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another fun guy is Rob Schneider, who makes you break up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell playing Buckman. Lauren Holly probably plays the more serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie and certainly plays the most serious character in the movie. The actor, I liked, was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric pictures his character takes in the movie are fun. <br /> <br /> Plot is a bit uneven, if Lt. Commander Tom Dodge, who for years has wanted to command his own sub. When he finally gets the chance, he gets instead of a brand new part a stainless WWII Diesel Sub, Stingray. His crew is no better, misfits of the US Navy. He is then put in a series of War Games that shows how an old Diesel Engine can handle itself against the current Nuclear Navy. Things aren't getting any better when he finds out that his diving officer is a female officer to see how women are doing the actual subgroups. To get the commander he wants, he must win the war games and blow a Dummy Ship. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, I actually laughed non-stop when I watched this movie in theaters. I loved when they were in silence and buckman farts, and everyone's reaction to the smell is fun. <br /> <br /> Altogether 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to see, it's great to have a movie so I hate movies that try to be 100% serious.
