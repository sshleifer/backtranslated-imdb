I am proud to say that I am a student at UW-Milwaukee where parts of the film were shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a movie class, possibly the same course as fellow Smith. <br /> <br /> It was here that I learned about "American Movie." Our professor told us about it shortly before the release. I was sure I was fascinated, but for some reason I went to see it for months (it should have been fine if it still plays, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally came to see it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. It is not a masterpiece - it goes a little too long - but I find Mark's passion and commitment inspiring. I hope this movie signals the beginning of bigger and better things to him. Perhaps his future "Northwestern" will propel him to fortune. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of ****) <br /> 108 min / Published by Sony Pictures Classics
