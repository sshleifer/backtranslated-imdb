Samuel Fuller knows war and is one of the only directors of American film history who could accurately depict the horrible experiences of it in a form such as the movie picture. His pessimism and idealism, if it sounds a little odd to blend together, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he is always out to tell the truth, but brutal (or put in melodramatic constructions) it can get. The verbote, however, deals with the post-war experience, as in the opening scenes we only get the great war of WAR - in bold font to a point. The opening shot is like a big exclamation mark that seems to continue into the rest of the scenes: A dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans up, we see another soldier shot down in war wheel terrain. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller sets the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven's music over a shoot-out between the Americans and the Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the fight continues, and then he goes on to be treated for his wounds. This may lead to the belief that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2-flick (something that would normally not be found in Beethoven and later to a degree, Wagner put in these pictures), but that is not the case. Instead, Fuller does this for a "Coming Home" kind of movie, but not at all in the sense that 'this soldier comes home damaged and so on and so on'. Instead of going home, Brent remains in Germany when he has fallen over the heels of the woman Helga (Susan Cummings, quite good at pulling German accent) and wants to work in lesser capacity in the military so he can marry her . What he is not aware of is that a) she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother, but it becomes complicated emotionally at the revelation point of the slightly naive but heartfelt Brent, and b) there is an underground Hitler youth secret called werewolves, who want to pick up right where Hitler ended - began small, despite the argument in the group - by attacking the very government now embedded in Germany to give them what Brent describes , a "blood transfusion." With this, plus footage from the Nuremberg trials, and (as told, I think by Fuller himself) a quick, unshaken story of Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multi-page look at a society in the immediate stretches of an immediate post-war environment. Although Rossellini handled it in his own way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller tackles it with layers. First, the love story, or what is the tragic downfall of a man who cannot see what he thinks, must be reasonable that it is his wife and a child in the way he cannot leave until the revelation that he (partially) has been swollen. Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as Helga's Young Confused Brother, perform with the greatest detail for emotions; It's not very simple B-movie parts, even though they might have been. Then another layer is the political, a society's struggle to tackle conquest, and a mentality that is fully sensed by Fuller in making the Nazis a total non-gray area thing: they are evil especially when they cancel the reason to meet. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a team team that is oddly absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller's 'talkiest' movies, which is not a bad thing given that it is one of his best written scripts, as the characters do not speak simply or in too many chatter (except for a small scene where two characters talk about the Hitler youth as youth crimes, which according to Fuller's autobiography is actually another layer to consider in the subtitle and 50's film period. And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style when he doesn't go for battle scenes or matches, as editing is not always very fast, and sometimes there is no step in a full minute or longer. There is a strange excitement that grows out of this, especially when there is something said of a sign that gets someone else wild or suspicious; Fuller could easily go to a large close-up, but there is a more grim, cold quality that does not move away from two people in a conversation without a simple over-shoulder deal. But when it does, Fuller as the great fight outside the US military office or the Nuremberg shooting can divide into Franz's memories of the werewolves, being like a great stylist like ever. <br /> <br /> Very hard to find but extremely worthwhile if you are either a fan of the director or WW2 movie in Germany - or even just a story-buff-verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional, with a cast that is better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards "others" that is just as judgmental and thought-provoking.
