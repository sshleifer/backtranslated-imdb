Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best movie from 1997. I could see this movie over and over and still love it. I'm not rushing to see the runaway romance / disaster epic Titanic again. The fact that Boogie Nights didn't even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrowed the academy is. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter and Robert Zemeckis' Contact came close to being as good as Boogie Nights. No other filmmakers in recent years have come far away from making a movie as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction - until now. Paul Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Like Tarantino, John Travolta's career gave a kick, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick that his career needs. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly make stars by Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful movie. The best thing about Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
