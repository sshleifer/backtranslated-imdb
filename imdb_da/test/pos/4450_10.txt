I watched this movie five times and never get tired of it. This contains traces of the "giallo" genre, but also with a vibrant Italian landscape setting, where ignorance and superstition are more mortal than any serial killer. With an excellent location (reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes by the Taviani brothers), good characterization and some of the finest re-reactors (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro waste, just one masterpiece to be discovered generation by generation (It was recently received great recognition at Paris Cinematheque on a duplex shelf for Lucio Fulci)
