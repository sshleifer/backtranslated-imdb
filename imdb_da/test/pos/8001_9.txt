Batman Returns is a really dark movie showing Caped Crusader's fight against Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll come to them later). Michael Keaton works well as Bruce Wayne and shows he's a good actor. Tim BUrton leads this picture well and the film's locations are impressive. Bad guys: Danny deVito is threatening as Penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a really hard childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She is the best catwoman ever! She is threatening and extremely sexy. There is a scene where she kisses Batman the cat way that just warms up the movie. The action scenes are also good, and the end is dramatic and tragic, probably the best end of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can control a Batman movie really well (he has already demonstrated this with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. As much as him.
