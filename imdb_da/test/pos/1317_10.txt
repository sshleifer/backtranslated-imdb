Mishima - a life in four chapters is, in my opinion, the best Paul Schrader movie for this day. Mesmorizing cinematography, accompanied by Philip Glass's mystical musical score, added a magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novels, whose originality and picturesque narrative is beautifully depicted in this image. As a gifted character, Mishima was plagued by serious self-conflicts where the majority of them are the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his last chapter or the battle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notorious masculine communities with centuries long warrior traditions and thus the expansion of the gap between the sensitive and the militant traditional side of Mishima itself. <br /> <br /> All Schrader's films (and those he wrote scripts for) are basically inner-conflict stories within a man who doesn't belong in an environment he lives in. This also applies to Mishima There, besides the education of the Japanese military school, was raised with love for theater and words. His death consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theatrical tales that ended in a lifelong game. Movies like this come together once in a long time, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
