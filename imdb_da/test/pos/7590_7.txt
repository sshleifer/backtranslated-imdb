This one real produced by the MGM in 1936 shows talents of two of its young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a way, these short films were promotional trailers that contained new talent in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist conducted this, which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. The orchestra, staying in a public park every Sunday, does not get the attention it deserves. Enter two music aficionados, Judy and Edna who love to hear the band played by one of their grandfathers. Two of the city's elders feel that there is no publicity for this type of entertainment, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls enter a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know, call and run errands and help their neighbors in exchange for a promise that they will attend the park concert next Sunday . Well, that day comes, and to their surprise, hardly anyone comes to the music. The two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing. The result is clear, people across the park flock to hear the talented young singers thus securing the orchestra's existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired song of the two stars who are wonderful in their reproduction. Ms. Durbin's operative voice fits well with Mrs. Garland's natural, creating a lovely duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out on it on TCM!
