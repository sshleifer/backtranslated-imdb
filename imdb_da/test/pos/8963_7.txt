Recap: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American congressman who (according to this movie) was instrumental in the United States' hidden war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: A pretty funny movie about Not so funny stuff, especially as they were real. But with a focus on the film, Hanks performs very well as a vicious female congressman with a good heart who is championing the hidden war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the entire movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman in particular, has a rather humorous tone. So much to add comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story that it tells, and perhaps it ends the most, is serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened to some questions about what could have been. So the movie works like a comedy if you want one, and a lot more serious if you want it. Something for everyone? 10.7
