Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy film all the time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan have performed brilliantly, while Aamir's plays were far better than the salman.Aamir Khan is known as' MR. PERFECTIONIST 'in Bollywood, and he proves it in all his films. The story moves around two young guys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) are both from poor families and are a great dreamer. They will be rich without any pain. So when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon) daughter of Mr.Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) coming to India to find her bridegroom, they leave both fathers their fathers to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins. There is also a twist in the movie that makes the movie even more fun. Paresh Rawal is in dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does. Hakti kapoor (crime master Gogo) also adds a great comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a first-minute, rib-casting comedy movie, and one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
