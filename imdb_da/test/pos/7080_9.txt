"One True Thing" is a very quiet movie that opened in the autumn of 1998 for glowing reviews, but a gentle box office. It tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) so that her father (William Hurt) can run her academic department . These terms are only general. The power of "One True Thing" lies in the way actors raise their characters across the Hollywood clich√© area. <br /> <br /> Streep is Kate, the perfect home baker whose ability to brighten up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume celebration celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since graduating from Harvard University, he has a certain fate about her. Ellen almost believes that mother is a simplistic head of air. On the other hand, she admires her father - who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York company and is almost heartbreaked when her latest piece is torn down by Hurt, which seems to be a very lonely figure. To get to the point when Kate gets sick, Ellen's perspectives change, and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt apologizes for not being there when the family needs him the most, and Ellen assumes he has an affair. Meanwhile, she has abandoned her desk at work to spend time crafting with her mother's "cult" group The Minnies, and also to learn that her mother is not as weak as she first assumed. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in character study. Streep is once again in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slowly but ends with a brilliant talk about the promises of marriage. Streep earned his eleventh Oscar nomination for this achievement. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that is not revealed until the final moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Bridget Jones's Diary" or whatever you have seen her and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it. Zellweger works within her character's bitter anger by understanding her parents, and realizes a young woman struggling to keep her lip up while she is screaming inside.
