This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The film has a great story and some amazing make-up and effects. The only thing I would love to see happen is a successor. The movie was created for a sequel and with improved technology, the second movie could be incredible. David Cronenberg will appear in a sequel as well as Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was an amazing original, creative and entertaining idea, and I could see it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this movie and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the movie.
