Beautiful .... the one word largely corresponds to this film. Everything from cinematography, director, acting ..... brilliant. At any point in the movie you can pause it and you will no doubt look at any mosaic or "artsy fart" that some people would say. I assure you that after a view, "Bobbycrush" will be stuck in the head. I know from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is fantastic. It goes well with the tone and pace of the movie. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make movies that show love and shame in true (and surreal) imagery.
