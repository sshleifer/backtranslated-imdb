This comment discusses "Northern and Southern Book I", which deals with the 1842-1861 period. The 19th century history in the United States is mostly identified by people with the civil war (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because it was civil war that put the Union under the tough test; it was the civil war that made the Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; Finally, it was this period that finally ended with the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> From the birth of film pictures, there were people who adapted the time on the screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. Still, the most famous film about north-south clashes is still, I assume, WIN (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent television series based on John Jake's novel, "North and South." It's the very best TV series ever made, and the time spent watching it is really valuable. I taped it on my video from Polish television many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. Why? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, Maines of South Carolina and the dangers of Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of living. Nevertheless, friendship unites them. But what they experience is the struggle that all people make: friendship infested with "truth" of "political correctness", love afflicted with hatred of "legal spouses", gentleness by "social heroes". Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - one who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares about friends, but political fanatics step in and destroy a lot. Finally, he is one who can see the tragic future of his country, but there is nothing he can do about the inevitable destiny of the South. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most aspects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that even though there are tragedies, he must rise from despair and live, as life is the most valuable thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship arises stronger than any prejudice, policy or conflict. Other grades are also particularly well-developed. There are villains such as Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really evil, but most people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is initially full of rebellion, prone to fight, but later he learns to be a true southern lord, for whom southern pride is not brave words, but primarily brave deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movements striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black breeding farms". Her marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of saying "NO" to Southern politics. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters, Brett and Ashton - sisters whose veins run completely opposite blood. Brett believes in her gentleness, but also naivety, in absolute faith. She marries Billy, even though he is northern because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of everything that is valuable in any young woman. However, Ashton is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who doesn't hesitate to do the most evil things. The clear picture of their world confrontation is their chat about men and family ... unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters go according to their values ​​... but war breaks out and they have to put a lot ... <br /> <br /> Second, the show ... someone said that not all people act naturally. I wouldn't say that. I'd rather say that all casts do very good jobs in their parts from the protagonists, who are portrayed by younger employees to the guests, made up of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a good job. I consider this role as one of his best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part may involve too much suffering, but she manages to express all kinds of emotions really well. Kirstie Alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolishing Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth considering as horribly ambitious Elkanah Bent as David Carradine as a monster man, disgusting Justin LaMotte. And, unlike him, there is Jean Simmons, who is truly excellent as Orry's mother, whose heart pervades the family's life and honor. <br /> <br /> Third, memorable moments "North and South" leave a creepy trace in one's mind. Who can forget the first meeting in Orry and Madeleine - what a charm, what kindness is there in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful that is a real drama at this moment, a drama of a woman left by someone who truly loved her. I also liked the Churubusco sequence and George Hazard looked worried about his dear friend, Orry's life. So his meetings with Constance are amazing. Virgilis speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of achievement. And the last part of the first part: Although North and South can separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically symbolize the train. There are simply so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to even mention half of them here. And these beautiful tunes by Bill Conti and shot in glorious landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say last? "North and South" is a true must on DVD, simply a fantastic television series about the victory of everything that is valuable in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truth, absolute fidelity. 9.10
