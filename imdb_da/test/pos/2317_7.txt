This movie is about a lot of misfits that must be assigned a task that is expected to fail miserably. Misfits pull together to complete their mission. <br /> <br /> Hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> Like the "Police Academy" movies, humor comes from the boiled characters on the boat. I thought it was an exciting movie and I want to stop watching it anytime on TV. No, it won't make you consider your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of humankind, but it's fun enough entertainment for 90 weeks. Plus, Lauren Holly looks warm in a marine uniform.
