Before starting my review, here is a quick lesson in Australian slang that can help you see the movie and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and abroad. In Australian slang, "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word relating to butt revealing underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of Australian cards, a "stubby" is a small canned bottle of beer and a " stubby holder "is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you love black comedies about small criminals, then you will love this movie, unfortunatley many people on IMDB with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humor have gone through this movie, which unfortunately makes this movie seem more mediocre than it is. Many reviewers have also compared it to Lock / Layer and Pulp Fiction, while it's the same genre, it's a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have also panned this movie by using Heath Ledger's death brother to open and direct the story to this movie without seeing the movie close enough to realize that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill the honor of the heath, this is explained midway through the film, but not clear enough for most to understand. This movie is also reminiscent of Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs, because it is the director / writers debut feature, and for a debut function it is as good as these two films as a fact like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs I rate this films as a 10/10 for a debut / director debut, but unfortunately Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan do not meet the expectations of his subsequent movie, Ned Kelly. <br /> <br /> This movie is one that you sho I will definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that holds up to multiple views quite easily.
