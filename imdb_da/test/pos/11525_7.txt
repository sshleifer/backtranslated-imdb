As a guy for four in his eighties, I thought this movie made convincing viewing - if not the edge-of-seat stuff. I deserve a much higher rating than the 4.3 it had when writing this. (I gave it 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz was again sparkling in yet another completely different role. The plot was a little stupid, but the point for the movie for me was beautifully summed up in the final, rather surreal order. A movement that ends with any parent. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that a young single bloke might find the movie rather boring, but for other people who aren't fast on high doses of testosterone, it would be somewhat sweet in this.
