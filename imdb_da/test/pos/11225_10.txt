It is a rare and fine play, an allegorium on death and transfiguration that is neither preaching nor mawkish. A work of mature and courageous insight, Northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind. Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders 1987 maintains the Wings of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin) an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum ranging from the everyday to the supernatural. This story of terrestrial and celestial prominent domains of the American West holds the adventurous literality that marked its German predecessor in the noble genre of angels who cast their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. Its heavenly transcendence, inspired by the doleful faith or impelled by a feverish dream, never shares ways of raw and root. This firm foundation redundates for great credit for writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
