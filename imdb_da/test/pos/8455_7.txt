All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller in the years to come. You have the star play - Michael Douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that largely launched his movie career, Fonda plays his typical direct female who makes his piece for the woman's lib, and Jack Lemmon is as confident as ever to show us a man with a crisis of confidence. Give them a shortcut theme that big businesses are duplicating, and it is encouraging to a kickoff, but to make life imitate art so soon after is a marketing man's dream. The script is impressively tight, intelligent but mercifully holding the jargon to a minimum and there is a true sense of sustained excitement brought into play by the director as our three protagonists ran to beat the clock. If you like 'flute fan' dramas, then it's not as good as "Insider", but it's all more than nervous enough.
