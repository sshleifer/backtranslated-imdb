The right best picture of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is better than Elia Kazan's GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (the final winner of that year's academic awards) in virtually every department. Edmard Dmytryk's closest perfection, John Paxton's terse script and J. Roy Hunt's expert Expressionist Lighting are wonderfully averted by an outstanding ensemble cast. Although Robert Young (who plays an easy, methodical, and very sympathetic policeman) and Robert Mitchum (who actually occasionally throws witty comment) are the nominal stars of the movie, it is Oscar nominated Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - as well as Paul Kelly in the small but crucial role Graham's pathetic man - giving the film's most memorable characterizations; Ryan proved so convincing as a homicidist racist that he eventually became typecast for a while and excellent in equally vicious roles in films like ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952), NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also known for its atypical structure, as Ryan's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, has been shot in a fair manner, while the true truth is evident from the bad, distorted memories of the true protagonist of the movie, which is not I haven't even played any of the movie stars! CROSSFIRE was originally also treated by homosexuality (as according to Richard Brooks' original source novel, The Brick Foxhole), but this taboo topic was unacceptable to the Hays Office at that time - far from the situation we have today (at least ) 3 gay-themed movies are in progress for this year's largest Oscars! <br /> <br /> The print used for Warner's DVD transfer shows some regrettable signs of wear and tear at times, but the sound of comment from noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is a good one, even though I'm not share their belief that Dmytry's career steadily fell to his HUAC problems, such as good pictures like SNIPER (1952), CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) was strong; having said that his partners at RKO with the producer Adrian Scott and writer John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, hopefully this will be part of the next Film Noir Box Set from Warners) and CROSSFIRE - his best work. In any case, the latter is, in my opinion, not only one of the central films of the 1940s, but also one of the finest noirs ever made.
