This review includes MILD SPOILERS but not enough to spoil the story ... Seet Nihon Chinbotsu (Sinking of Japan or Japan Sinks, depending on where you live) recently, a remake of the 1970s movie of the same name that in itself was based on Sakyo Komatsu's best-selling novel. This film is a gem of Japanese filmmaking. It seems that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. The Americans predict it would be in 40 years, but according to Dr. Tadokoro (a seemingly "crazy" scientist), it happens in less than a year. The Japanese government is not as convinced, but sets up a disaster evacuation plan as well as forming a new D1 team to deal with the crisis. On a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese Prime Minister was killed and the cabinet was panicked. The D1 team is back to dealing with most conditions and is headed by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (Dr.Tokokoro's former wife). Instead, she turns to Dr. Tadokoro for advice, and he plans to blow astronomically large holes in Japan to avert the process of sinking. Japan should soon negotiate with different countries and persuade them to adopt Japanese refugees. It seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if ever, touch-wood, I hope Ito Misaki will be safe ... she can always stay in my place ... hee hee). The scenes of the evacuations are really well done and show destruction, suffering and desperation that civilians have to face in such disastrous times. And man's many faces surfaces, arrogance, egoism, bribe, brave, fat ... This is a really well made movie. the storytelling is solid, with a fascinating story and wonderful plays. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was done really well and portrayed a sign and often crazy scientist who kicks and bases things. His frustration and worries were very visible, and that is a really good thing. Reiko (the game of the beautiful Shibasaki Kou) was also played quite well and has the most memorable line in the whole movie (see it to find out) and I want her to have a good actor voice. She plays Toshio Onodera's love interest (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh I almost forgot ... she really has really long hair ~ And there is also a subtle but background love story that is well written, and if anything, the Japanese do it really well, it is love stories ... <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur, and if you are interested in geography, you have a really good time (I know I did ... hehe). I can see that they went a long way to making the film's theory credible, and the first few graphical screens and explanations were done pretty well (though you have to apologize for Japan's famous Engrish. <br /> <br /> OK about the effects (it's just about the effects, isn't it?). Having seen the movie with awe-inspiring, I have to say that this movie has special effects that are on equal footing (or even better) with some Hollywood productions. ... the massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... everything performed splendidly. The opening scene is so cool, the first earthquake catches you in surprise, mountains fall, the destruction Due to volcanic eruptions you get to hug ... to actually see Mount Fuji warm up is a wonder ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it's so sad !!! But what I felt was one of the best scenes was The huge tsunami scene that sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope of sticking to ... the final scene also deserves to mention ... wonderful things. If you like effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... every good movie has a good song behind it. The seriously addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by the super sweet and sweet SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it's simply lovely. I feel that it fits in very well with the movie, and it shows that whatever disasters hit us, our love and strength will keep us going. The disaster scenes are handled with orchestral music and sometimes silence (a Japanese specialty) and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on the screen. Oh, and I mention it's a really, really, really wide screen? Okla, has been going on and on about this movie. Yes, I LOVED it and hope to see again ... It has plot holes, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well made. I would give it a 9 out of 10. I am happy to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also one of their best. If you haven't seen it, you really must today ... it's a must see!
