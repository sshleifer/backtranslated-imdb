I have seen this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life and it never gets old. For all the clear remarks and insults (mainly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a huge heart. And that's what keeps this movie fun after all these years. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), the master car salesman and has ridden it all his life. But after his death dies on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and must be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a large car company. So in order to save the company, Tommy has to go to sell the company's new brake pads. In continuation of the tour, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is a former classmate of Tommy's, who was Big Tom's right hand. (and real best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy between them to drive the world. It's the big, stupid guy compared to the smart little guy. It works and some of their scenes are unforgettable fun. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good there as when they get the audience to laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have a little talk about Chris Farley. I read his biography ("Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Actions" for anyone who cares) and understand who Chris was in reality, made this movie more special to me. Chris Farley was a really good person who fought and ultimately failed to conquer his addiction. Although this was the first movie he had a big part in, it's his best movie. It really showed who he was and just how much talent he had. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, though it doesn't make it fun. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are matched with a good screen shot. Rob Lowe is the appropriate slimy as Tommy's "new brother", and Bo Derek is solid as his voice mother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Thishy makes it easy to believe that they are father in son. Big Tom is just as crazy as his son, though he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth behind the advertisement. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedians. He keeps the pace fast and energetic, but most importantly he knows how to make comedy fun. He does not make the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they are doing and he allows them to do so. But Segal goes one step further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone, which both drags the heartbeats (real) and tickles the funnybone. Critics did not like "Tommy Boy." Shame on them. A movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversive intellectual to be fun (God forbid Farley and Spade was forced to do mute comedy at "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.
