The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a landmark theme story of the weirdest fashion. The film is centered on a medium-sized youth couple who pay pay slips to pay slips in 1976. One day a mysterious box with a red button appears. Later in the day, an eerie gentleman appears and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars, but a person they do not know will die. It is a disturbing and provocative issue exciting outlined in the trailer and TV spots. But let it be known that you just don't know what you have before you see it. Sometimes pretentious and somewhat melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective because of its good performances and exciting subject. It would be unfair to ruin some of the plot twists for you, but let's just say that the movie will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not quite meet others as it begins to outline. There is very obvious symbolism and subtitle in the film, which is both interesting and annoying, as it was not so evident in his other superior movie Donnie Darko. There's not too much to say without destroying the movie for you. It is supposed to inspire lots of cafe chats afterwards. But I also want to say it's shot well and has an appropriate aged look to it and it's worth seeing. Check it out.
