I feel very strongly that this movie was like waiting to exhale with white women in the 1950s. As in Waiting to Exhale, all the female characters were mixed with men who were either married or not good. The only difference was beyond the obvious that there was not much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (Hope Lange's guy), but even then there was conflict in this relationship. The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together, and who had hope and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, romance did not seem easy, even though they were young, intelligent and attractive. This movie can be called a tearjerker with the weirdest part involving Suzy Parker's character whose obsession with an ex-girlfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is a must see.
