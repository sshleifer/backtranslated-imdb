One of the myths of the early sound era is that they could not get Western because they had trouble recording sound on the spot. In fact, it was the financial restrictions for depression that temporarily killed the genre, at least in the "A" budget. But in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn had really kicked in, the "western" western flourishing examples, including Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron, flourished. The Big Trail was perhaps the largest of them all ?? a giant pioneer of western shot in an early widescreen process titled greatness. Thanks to the latest DVD release, we are now showing the widescreen version along with the full screen shot at the same time. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the adventure spirit lay in great outdoor prospects, and in many ways a perfect choice. He makes great use of the broader frame to show the western landscape at its most breathtaking. Very typical of Walsh is a number of shots towards the beginning, like the one in which a woman cuts firewood. Most of the screen is tightly filled with wagons and other clutter, but in a corner we see the desert stretching invitingly. When the lorry goes, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with carts pulling away as stage curtains. These shots are not as effective in the full screen version, but on the wider canvas Walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better. <br /> <br /> But there's an unlucky flipside for this. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency to place the actors in the middle of the shot is as if they were in an imaginary full screen box. The extra width just becomes that ?? additional. It may seem logical at first because it means that we politely see so much of the actors as we would in a full-screen picture. But that makes the players small and insignificant within the frame, while the entire background business dominates the shot ?? and there are a lot of backgrounds in the Big Trail. When widescreen formats resurrected in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake before eventually realizing that in talkie scenes it is better to hit actors from around the chest and lose some of their height, but allow them to fill the screen . <br /> <br /> It's a shame because The Big Trail is a very well balanced and fine scripted effort. Romance and revenge partial plots are simple but well-defined, and do not threaten to overweight each other or pioneer story. It could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other, we are distracted by cattle herds, drive cars or anything that fills each extra empty frame. Still, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some good comedies, largely courtesy of "Comical Sweden" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also known as John Wayne's first leading role. While Wayne is another victim of distant framing in dialogue scenes, we at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but self-conscious vocal delivery. He betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clear there. Unfortunately, this potential was not widely realized at that time, and he spent the rest of the decade slumbering it in B pictures before finally hit the star. Also in this picture is Waynes mate (and later productive character actor) Ward Bond. He is not credited, but you can spot him in a number of scenes, most notable about the 80-minute mark where he stands at Tyrone Power's left. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a wonderful epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it was this amazing scale that would put the western (and widescreen) in bed for some time. And even though the 40s and 50s are now considered the Western Golden Age, was it a changed genre with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west? not better or worse, but of a different kind. The early talkie period was the end of an era where Westerns could be truly gigantic.
