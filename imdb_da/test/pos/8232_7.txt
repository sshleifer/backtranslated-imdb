After clearing up Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a nice little rally. Plus a rather interesting scheme of sharecropping. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he is after villains Billy House and Steve Brodie who run homesteaders from their farms. The homesteaders they drive away are in a sharecropping scheme funded by Robert Ryan. It appears that he is betting the various farmers on a homestead package for a percentage of the profits from their crops. Ryan is losing his shirt because of all shenanigans. As depicted by Scott, Bat Masterson is a stand-up Western hero who has a passion for going east and becoming a reporter as we all know he did it later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic plot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a little stupid and degrades the action. Anne Jeffreys makes it fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes, as always, provides the amazing comic book help. <br /> <br /> A great complement to the Randolph Scott collection of westerns. Also interesting, because his later Western films do not have him wearing a hat as white as this one. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of Professional Bull Riders, a proud resident of Liberal, Kansas, a city with a great tradition of Bat Masterson marshaled there or not.
