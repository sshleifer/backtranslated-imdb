Intelligent, nail-reading drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and was soon on the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the movie). A nuclear power plant in southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to become public with the real story behind an accident at the factory. A questionable valve problem shows that a television news movie shows that it was an accident that hit catastrophic proportions - and worse, security conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that threatens everyone's life. The movie is occasionally too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interaction, but the performances by Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a puff-piece newswoman at the right place at the right time) and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) is fantastic. The thrown bits involving nuclear protesters are both exactly accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news biz (with its corporate structure and stupid yes-men) is captive. *** 1/2 from ****
