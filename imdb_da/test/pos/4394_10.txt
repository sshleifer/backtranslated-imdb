The first time I saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. When I saw it again, it made much more sense. Give it a try, see it more than once, there are many key elements that prepare the story that could miss the first and second time to see it. The Cohen brothers brilliantly shine actual events from the early 20th century into this story to create a credible attitude and history. The combination of Clooney's leading role blends well with Turturro and Nelson's related actions. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is fun. The soundtrack is also good. This movie has become a favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.
