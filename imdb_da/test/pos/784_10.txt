I just watched this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I have to say I thought it was great. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The film was about a seventeen year old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeenth year old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I must honestly say that this is one of my favorite films. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. If you did not catch one of the performances at the film festival, it should come out in theaters later this year. Please see it! It's a good movie.
