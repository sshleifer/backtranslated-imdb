I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, its basic fox enhanced version of the simpsons (cau'se lets face the simpsons are very dry if you are over 9 years. It's political, irrational and irresistible Peter, Stewie, & Quagmire are my favorites, Peter because he is rude, uncomfortable and just doesn't give a mischief. Stewie because he doesn't want to lie, by his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least And twitter because a guilty pleasure is filthy jokes, there is also an episode for everyone, if you are the political type, then Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3). the sexual and bodily humor, there is impossible emission (VOL.2 SEASON 3.) Or if you like other kinds of humor, there is dusty Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2) .What I say is that when you see this show, there is unparalleled humor for everyone. GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOOOO!
