when i was a kid it was the movie i was watching. I think it's a good movie for the kids to see and parents don't have to be afraid of violence or obscene images. Rainbow Brite is a cheerful young girl and she tries to make the winter away. She finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to herself. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
