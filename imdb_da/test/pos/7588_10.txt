As has already been noted, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) could be considered the first music video. This was a happy accident as a result of MGM's need to twist a series of short films for exhibition with its feature-length material. They had a couple of fresh young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially merged a mix of musical styles into a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in the park. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed at the time they would capture the best collection of images since the Eisenstones "Odessa Steps" sequence. <br /> <br /> It is Sunday with some inattentive people sitting around a small wooden shells in the park while a tired-looking ensemble plays Strauss. Events unfold and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The operative Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland accompanies the contrasting "Waltz with a Swing". The Climax blends the two styles into a duet of "Americana". <br /> <br /> One should see. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
