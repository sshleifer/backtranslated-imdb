I wanted to see this, to get an inside look at the show. It told the story more about Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still thought it was amazing. We must see that Robin is always 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The introductions of the main players seem to be right for me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all of Williams's energy. The little behind-the-scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley) were enlightening. I also thought that Richmond-Peck's Harvey was also a lovely stone in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This movie told the ancient story of Hollywood people going through stardoms up and down. It kept me glued on my TV, and I learned to love Robin, good hell, most of the time everyone seems to be the super people I sometimes think Hollywood is. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why the network people are always playing to be idiots. We never saw the head of ABC. Just heard him like Charlie from Charlie Angels (I wonder if this way is planned?). It seems so sad that a show at number 1 could be so destroyed by their own network. I think this story could be told about everyone's life as they climb the ladder to any job. Movies and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with, you just want to come back in their past to remember your own past. I remember seeing the show and always wondering what is happening in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me and I will see some of them. It cannot all be the truth, it is also not a lie, but eventually it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.
