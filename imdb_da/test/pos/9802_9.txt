Mine takes the end. Bobby died in the hands of his father-in-law. Mike had tried as he needed to get Bobby out. Only one child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died .... Mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind ... about how Bobby left ... Mike made a plane flying Bobby out. Children who are sexually and violently abused often create completely different worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> Seeing my old residential area was also great. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived just around where these houses were filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses ... not studios ... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills ... we use to hike them as kids .... looking down on our little valley .... see glimpses of the bay. Was a real nostalgia trip for me.
