Hilarious and low-budget comedy is best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-reflecting humor resembles a truly raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recurring lines filled with ethnic veil and horrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedies like this around today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will warrant many viewing and review to appreciate some of the parts. If you've had the state and / or wet hot American summer, get ready for a little more honor. If you consider this for the younger audience yourself, I would say that every child on earth should see this.
