This is probably the greatest war movie and certainly one of the greatest films. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this gloomy glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this silent silence and lack of manipulation that gives the film its amazing power. There is no attempt to make a hero out of Ichikawa's protagonist Tamura either. He is just a badly condemned sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror that hopes, but is not sure he can hang on to his humanity in the process. Ichikawa's violent lack of oblique and illusion makes Brande on Plain alone. Ichikawa died February 2008.
