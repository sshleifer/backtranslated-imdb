Not all movies should have the predictable ending that we are all so accustomed to, and it is great to watch movies with really unusual phrases. But with that said, I was really disappointed in the end of the party. In my opinion, the end did not really fit in well with the rest of the film, and it essentially destroyed the story that was told. <br /> <br /> You use the entire movie to discover everyone and their feelings, but the events of the last 2 minutes of the movie would have influenced majorly in everyones character, but the film ends and leaves it too wide. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was very well made, and unlike similar films like Serendipity all scenes were credible and did not go over the top.
