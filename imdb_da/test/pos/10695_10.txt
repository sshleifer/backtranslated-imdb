Excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic, cult-ninja flicks of any time. The reason is that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. I mean to be honest if I could get ninja ability through possession I would. Moreover, in order to be in the 80s and so on, the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this decade is evident and, after all, Ninja 3 The Domination can keep the original from the American ninja-cookie cutter shapes that Troubled the 80s for so long. This chick is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids .... I think the first American ninja was great, but let's get real people, it has nothing on Ninja 3
