"Closet Land" tells a strong story and has many different subtle elements. You could read lots of things about the movie's plot before hand, but you don't really have to. All you need to know is that the film is about an interrogation. Along the way, we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. Ultimately, the film constitutes a warning (really though the film has several aspects) about what happens to people's freedoms when they "see the other way" and ignore the injustices with them around them. <br /> <br /> If you have an hour and a half and know where to rent this, I highly recommend you do it.
