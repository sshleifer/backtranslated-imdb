This movie is trying to run away to the typical 'I'm fighting because I'm bound to defend the motherland. The NAZIs are all bad, I am against them '(typical of German war films). How? Don't talk too much about it and just refer to the war and the POWs. Nevertheless, I would like to see a German movie that would be something between Kom and See extremity and the "bad NAZI" Das Boot. I say this because the German films, with the exception of this factor, are the best showing World War II and the German side. You can easily see some of the German hierarchical relationships, very different from those in the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie trying to get a real view of what was Stalingrad and I wasn't there and I doubt most people were there now, but if I wanted to Choosing a movie depicting this fight would probably not be the only American enemy at the gates. Why do I say this? Because even the best soldiers are not quite, and given the conditions, they can consider their own lives instead of the fatherland. This applies to all ranks, and finally, you see that Paul gives the example.
