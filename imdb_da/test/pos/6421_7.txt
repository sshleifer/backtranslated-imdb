I first heard about this while I was searching online for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror action, the contemporary THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974, if R2 SE DVD from Raro Video, by the way I recently acquired)? ? where it is referred to as being in a similar vein but also just as good. After watching FOOTSTEPS for myself, can I see where that reviewer came from ?? since both films deal with the psychological degradation of their female protagonist. Stylish, but this is due much more to the art house cinema than anything else ?? especially the work of Alain Resnai and Michelangelo Antonioni (and especially LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975]); Therefore, some have accused it of being "deadly boring" ?? an epithet often linked to such 'pretentious' (read: cerebral) fare! <br /> <br /> Overall, does the film involve a woman's quest (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the previous three days? as she seems to have no remembrance. After a series of cryptic tracks, does she travel to the "mythical" land in Garma (nearby places, so carry the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember)? where she meets more people (including Lila Kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort), apparently reminiscent of the heroine staying there during her 'blackout'! Most notably, however, is a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, from Mario Bavas BARON BLOOD [1972]) ?? the former always seems to happen on stage in good moments, while the latter seems to confuse Bolkan with another woman (sporting long red hair and a mediocre touch!). Although essentially a piece of humor, this is nevertheless a gripping puzzle: inevitably, vague events are spurred with a deliberate pace? and how much of the film's power derives from the remarkable central achievement (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the fine Lucio Fulci giallo A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN [1971]). However, there is no denial of Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's contribution (which provides a large number of sweeping camera movements and an effective color scheme adopts orange / red / blue filters to create atmosphere and comes up with a saturated look for the disorienting, bizarre finale) and Nicola Piovani's appropriate melancholy score (the composer is best known today for his Oscar-winning work on Roberto Benigni's Holocaust-themed tragi-comedy LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). With this in mind, it is worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I was looking at: well, it seems difficult to get in its original form (I cannot be sure whether it is unclear here or not, except to say that the movie ran for 89 minutes while the IMDb lists it at 96), this edition of a rather slaughtered English-language VHS is released (the duplication is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with burnt-in Swedish subtitles for start-up (in addition to the DivX copy Frozen for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story about 82 minutes mark)! Still, we get a welcome bonus, that is, a 9-minute highlights from the Soundtrack in MP3 format. I realize that I have not yet mentioned the moon's mission subplot, as Klaus Kinski's presence is limited: by the way, he also had a short but decisive role in another good arty thriller with sci-fi leanings (and also in a distinctive location) ?? namely LIFESPAN (1974). When I was watching the movie, I couldn't understand what possible connection this had to the central plot? Except that Bolkan referred to a recurring dream of a movie she had once seen but not to the end, "Footsteps On The Moon" (a somewhat misleading alternative title to the movie itself) called ?? fun, she first remembers the picture as BLOOD ON THE MOON (which is, of course, a classic 1948 Western Noir with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!). Having said that, did I take this "diversion" in step as just a scary press on the movie (also given Bolkan's previous appointment as a translator at a conference that discussed the future of the Earth)? and had certainly not expected the astronauts to turn up on Garmas beach at the end to pursue the female line where the sand becomes so terribly lunar to the moon! <br /> <br /> The movie's plot will probably make more sense on another view ?? But to be honest, this is best used as a visual / audio experience, and one should not really expect it to deliver a story that is in any way clear and easily rationalized! To the record was the only other Bazzoni bet I had managed to capture prior to this, the middle straight giallo THE FIVE CORD (1971), starring in Franco Nero (which I had recorded on Italian television at the end of the night) ; Some time ago I got hold of his spaghetti-western version of "Carmen" entitled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinski ?? as a DivX (after I had already missed a matinee broadcast of it)? But the switch was somehow defective and therefore the disk wouldn't play properly!
