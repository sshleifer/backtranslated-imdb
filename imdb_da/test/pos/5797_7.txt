In Russia, the ordinary teenager, Vera (Natalya Negoda), lives a relaxed life with her drunkard father and his simpleeton mother, without working and waiting for the call for a technical course by telephone operator. Her brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, who are always motivating arguments. When Vera meets the university's Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) students, they fall in love with each other and decide to get married. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I've just seen "Malenkaya Vera" and I liked this deep family drama a lot. I'm not familiar with the lifestyle of the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first one when Victor tells Vera she was perceived not because her parents wanted to get her but because they wanted to move to a bigger apartment. Another when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties in Vera family and their friends, repression in the park and other situations depicted in the film are common in third country countries. This low budget film is very orderly and the story is very deep and genuine. The game has amazing performances, and actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. In front of the Brazilian VHS, published by Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the centerfold of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, as many long sentences in Russian are limited to short translation in few words. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("The Little Vera")
