Nelson is a doctor who wants his four students to kill him and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife. So they do and soon enough, all the medical students would like to know if there is life after death. Life afterlife is not about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more eerie. Earlier ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. It has some rather scary moments that can translate into reality, and it makes people think a little about what happens when you die. It is a good movie to see when it rains and you feel down. It is also a little strange. <br /> <br /> See it with a haunted past.
