AristoCats is such a fantastic Disney classic that I just loved as much as a child. Still to this day I can't resist seeing it, it's just such a wonderful and charming movie with great animation and lovely songs. I really miss the animation films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. This movie is just about irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats that played the piano, learned the appecio's, lol, it was just as sweet with piano and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very spoiled in their large mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them as if they were her children. But when the lady feels it's time to do her will, she leaves too cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth cat named Thomas O'Malley, they go home to their lady, but learn fun to be a treasure. <br /> <br /> AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a little over looked. I would always highly recommend this movie to children or families it can be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and the story are just memorable. I always want to be in the movie's best song "Everyone wants to be a cat", such a fine song. I also love the dogs that guarded the farm where cats were left, they were just so sweet. This is a great movie, please see it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
