On June 14, 1905, sailors boarded the Russian battleship, Potemkin, during the Russian Revolution this year rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second biased treatment they receive, and especially the maggot-infected meat they have to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that time is ripe for a revolution. And then Sergei M. Eisenstein's burgeoning classic of Russian propaganda begins, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battle-Potemkin.' <br /> <br /> The film itself is filled with shining examples of amazing visual images: glasses from a runaway ship captain are delicate from the side ropes he had been thrown; the body of a deceased mutine lies peacefully on the coast, the sign on the chest reading "killed for a pile of garbage;" close-ups of the fist of the hundreds of spectators finally occupied by the tsarist regime; a fateful baby carriage career down the Odessa Steps as desperate spectators waking up with breathless breath (this scene was memorably "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly exciting scene in his 'The Untouchables'); The barrels in several guns are scarcely smoothed against the vastly fought battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> But the movie itself is best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes ?? But as a single film, and in fact, each scene is hugely memorable. Although divided into five rather distinct chapters, the whole movie flows wonderfully; At no time do we find ourselves lost, and we are absolutely never in doubt about which side we should be sympathetic to. <br /> <br /> The film is often referred to as "propaganda" and that is exactly what it is, but it does not have to carry a negative connotation. The 'Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein for a particular purpose in mind, and it does this perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century's celebration of the failed 1905 revolution, 'Potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its homeland symbolizing the revival of Russian art after the revolution. It is a little unfortunate that Eisenstone's films failed to perform well at the Russian cash register, which was reportedly beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood movie in his opening week and ran for just four short weeks. Fortunately, even though they were banned on various occasions in different countries, "The Battle-Potemkin" was more admirable abroad. <br /> <br /> The movie also showed a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test its "montage" theories. Through quick editing and remote images of the amount of extras, the audience must not sympathize with any individuals but with the revolutionary population in general. However, Eisenstein briefly breaks this mold into a scene where Vakulinchuk escapes the master who tries to kill him, and of course during the famous Odessa Steps sequence, as our hearts are terrified of the unfortunate child's life in the tumbling baby wagon. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched, largely with orchestral works by Dmitri Shostakovich, worked wonderfully to increase the emotional effects of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films in the silent era, "The Battleship Potemkin" is a triumph of phenomenal film production, and is a significant piece of film history, the very exaggerated events in the movie (among other things, there was never a violent massacres on the Odessa stairs), so completely anchored in memory that we are often uncertain of the true story behind the imagined events, which is a great achievement.
