This is a very funny movie. There is a self-defeating, iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing. The characters are interesting. The movie flows very well and keeps your interest in the entire movie's 1 hour, 50 minute duration. Movie quality is not of the highest Hollywood standards; but the original movie should be made in the genre in a gritty punk rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the filmmakers is very well detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers even become the main characters in the documentary version of the film. The interviews of the filmmakers and the actors have been brought together in a very entertaining story illustrating the battles involved in making the original film, the possible failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rise from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. In my mind, the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining movie than the original movie (Waldo's Hawiian Vacation) ever been. Two thumbs up for a job well done.
