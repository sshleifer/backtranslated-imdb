The last film by Vice President Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer is on the phone") is a truly exciting but incomprehensibly neglected giallo that contains virtually all trademarks that make this Italian horror subgenre so magnificent and addictive to the fans . There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, false priests ??), lots of scary moments, plot twists left and right, excellent music and ?? Last but not least ?? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is a kind of prologue, is a strong piece of horror! What is it about ordinary baby dolls that make them so scary? When the anonymous man dressed up as a priest, a little girl attacked and the broken head of her doll ran down a staircase, sending it really cold shakes through my spine! Years later, the young girl from the prolougen is an adult woman tied to a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money, but uses her happiness to stimulate other disabled people to practice sports and remain positive. She ?? Joanna ?? fall in love with his personal trainer, and they immediately married. Of course, he is only after his money and begins to terrorize Joanna by reviving her childhood injuries that crippled her. The repetitive images of a creepy preacher, ruled by eerie melodies and a nursery rhymes, give "Formula to a Murder" with lots of real scary and Alberto De Martino's instructions are very determined. The plot is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a brilliant greedy scourge. Due to some plot gaps and lack of originality, this movie may not compete with Italy's best horror action, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many formerly obscure and unknown Italian gialli received marvelous DVD releases, and hopefully "Formula for a Murder" will be dealt with soon. Meanwhile, good luck tracking this baby down!
