Aristorcats is a hilarious movie that not many people have seen. It is clearly not so many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It is my favorite of the Disney classics who have tons of amazing movies already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I would have gotten them taken care of too. I would be ruined by some old bags that I had been working on for so many years, just decide to give her the will to the cats. I would also kill them. I don't even like cats so I wouldn't give a shame. I think The Aristorcats are so fun and sweet. There are many characters that are fun, like Edgar. Aristorcats are my favorite of the Disney classics and it is final. The cat is out of the bag. <br/> <br /> Aristor Cats: **** / ****
