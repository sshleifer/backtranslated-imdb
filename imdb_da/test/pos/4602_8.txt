There is no other word for it ... Fox dumped this without any marketing of any kind. No one in the country, except those who have been looking forward to this movie, knows something about it. All the red flags have flown. It must be a mess, it can't be anywhere as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Although Office Space is not, this movie has absolutely satirical bites and jokes. It is a misfire at certain levels, but who is to blame is left to mystery. <br /> <br /> Based on what is currently shown in theaters, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's fun, sometimes laugh-incredibly fun. It is effective, sometimes brilliant. What it is not as far as I can tell is finished. We'll see something coming from this movie again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoot. Alone, it can be fun. It is sometimes ballsy. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around at the mall, I was surrounded by advertising and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It's not quite as dusty a dystopia as 1984, but this film paints a nasty future for our culture. And there doesn't seem to be much that anyone can do about it. Anyway, go see this if you can and try to figure out what happened that it was so specifically buried.
