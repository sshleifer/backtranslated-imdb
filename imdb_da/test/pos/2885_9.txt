Onstage John Osborn's adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" is a great tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright. On the screen with a little editing, it gets a little sloppy because of cutting 3 crucial scenes from the game (one is an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed.) However, the action is brilliant. Sir John Gielgud returns to his wild roots like Lord Henry, and although he is a decade old for the role, he becomes quite the enigmatic, deadly cad and cynic that Wilde has lived so carefully in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong and offers a touching portrait of the disturbing artist Basil Hallward.Peter Firth, while I was not originally my view of Dorian, handling the role of style and grace ... and later with a convincing burden of cruelty. The support money is just as fine, Gielgud's former 'Importance of Being Earnest' co-star Gwen Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity, and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane. Knowledge, pathos and tensions in Wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other nausea is with hair styles. Many of them seemed out of place, looking more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairstyles rather than the actual style. Overall, acting and writing behave this production to a high level of small screen excellence.
