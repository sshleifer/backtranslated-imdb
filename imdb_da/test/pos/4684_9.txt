Over the past few months I have seen many reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The essence of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that the film for all its modernist bravado and high budget technology does not have much substance where it counts. Watch people, it's just a funny movie. This is the type of picture where you have to sit back, relax and just enjoy the constant pace of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001) you can concentrate on the characters and plot at the same time without having to think much (lucky for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there is a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), it may not be so pleasing to forget what the trailers turned out to be, and some of the dialogue may seem meaningless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert who meets the Gene Shalit action and enjoy yourself once! Oh, and another thing, no matter what you do, don't compare it to the original, to repeat what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, IT IS NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION !! My advice - if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother to see the Italian job. But if you don't have a serious inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton get hit by a bunch of cranes, go ahead. Bottom Line, my fellow players, are: Enlightenment and fun, Dammit.
