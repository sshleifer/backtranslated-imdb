In short, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell out. First: The part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot instructor who gave him a golden shower !!! (I laughed so hard!) Other: The part where he tried to prove that he was a swimming school instructor. He seemed like a pro dive in, but as expected he could not swim (properly at least ^^). But the fun part of this was when he finally reached the end and said "how was it" or something. It was so friggin fun, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this anime series, I highly recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the most fun!
