Kramer vs Kramer is the story of a marital breakdown and the consequences of the same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more to a minor child, who in this case is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer vs Kramer is the greatest strength that movies is the way parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to audiences as whole-minded people with many sides to their nature. Although the film is oblique in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he is not presented as any kind of saint, and Streep is also not a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career oriented man in the advertising game. He has largely ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, but it is a big shock to him when Streep says love is no longer there and she wants to go out. She also wants to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents gets Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying in another agency. At that time, after over a year, Streep decides that she wants custody. Both parents make convincing witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations the tie is always broken in favor of the mother. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars for this movie, her in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are determined, Streep gets less screen time than Hoffman, if that's crucial. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for marriage failure. As for Meryl, it is a cook's choice for her as it is for many women to balance career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche records for everyone to see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have won the Oscar for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked his first by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene steal the child stealing the movie. Children with their lack of inhibition are natural actors, and Henry is great because he comes across as a real child, not a Hollywood child. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy treated Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done much worse than Channel Spencer Tracy in his performance. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs Kramer also won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director of Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is an intelligent and compelling drama about adults who fall out of love and try to deal with the best they can with it for themselves and their children. Don't miss it if you ever broadcast.
