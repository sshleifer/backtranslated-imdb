A man named Jerry holds an old Aztec doll. But this crooked little figure is obsessed with an evil spirit who takes over Jerry's body and pushes him to spill the blood ... I have seen two other horror films "The Dorm The Turned Blood" and "The Kindred" by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow, and I have to say that "The Power" doesn't disappoint either. The plot is slow but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore.The scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by weapons that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot.I liked this low budget horror movie And you should also, if you are in the 80's horror genre.8 out of 10.
