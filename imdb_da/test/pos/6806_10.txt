My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign of ... but I would like to add a few words. <br /> <br /> ?? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite films as a child. (The other is "The Wizard of Oz ??.) The cinematography, play, manuscript and music came together, such a wonderfully little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my narrow eyes. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold followed The manuscript book is quite good. The characters are so carefully created. It's easy to get emotionally involved throughout the family and the cozy little Irish village where they live. The principle ... completely outsider believes in the horse and even enough for a chance to try the biggest horse race in the world ... is awe inspiring to any young person, especially a young girl in her 40s ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans creature let alone athletes.You have to be terribly boiled for not appreciate it is deserved. <br /> <br /> But the perspective I most loved about this movie is the innocent innocence of the moral message. It's almost magical how "mother and apple pie" file I was really surprised by the IMDB reviewer who asked ... "Was the world really this trust?" and then proceeded to chastize the director of his complacency with regard to the unchaperoned overnight journey involving the two main characters. My answer to his question is an unequivocal YES !!!! The movie goes the world was relying on the 40s. /> <br /> My grandparents remember to take my mother to this movie when it was released, and then my mother took me to see it when I was young and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time When she could see it repeatedly on video tapes, now we have it on DVD, it has been a family favorite for generations, albeit generations of horse lovers, it was never about sex ... it's about to age! about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals Also so old-fashioned it wasn't even about prize money! It's about the girl who understood her horse, had what it took to be the best, and yes, the director was actually worried about Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development g, because the book made a great deal about Velvet Brown (Liz Taylor's character) cutting her hair and tying her breast so she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase. This was just a guy who was sports since then ... I think there have only been 12 women ever to compete in this race. It's almost insulting that someone would bother to think about the Lolita case about this particular movie ... Anyone has had anything to do with a young girl and her horse, knowing that the only thing they ever think of with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now for a good deal of trivia ... the stunt ride was done by the now famous Horse Whisperer, Monty Roberts. I think he's mentioned for his riding in the movie credits. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 out of 10! I never get tired of seeing it again.
