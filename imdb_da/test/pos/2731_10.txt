I just watched the movie "15 park avenue", which was the first night presentation film in the asia community human rights film festival in new york.i was really moved by the subject of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of "mithi" by leading actor concona late sharma.i only have one word for anyone reading this comment, running to get a copy of this gem and see it. My sincere thanks to the director monkeys who have done an excellent job again. This comes once in a blue moon, and I was lucky enough to watch this movie on the screen and also participated in a post-film discussion / question and answer session with concise late sharma. in a single word "a wonderful experience.
