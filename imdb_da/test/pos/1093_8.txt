It is by far the most final film on the police force that I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV movie. Dead straight dialogues, dumb treatment of the subject, brilliant direction and amazing performance (even of those with little work to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and Don, although they are professional rivals, is great. And then the little events are like an insider who does not give information to Imtiaz, even though he is basking in the closet, but only to Nana when he is out. The change in working conditions with the change of the senior is treated wonderfully. The first half keeps a completely confused and moving as a documentary with Nana, acting as a mentor to Jatin, explaining the work of his intricacies and philosophy. All in all, one of the most amazing movies on the police in Indian cinema. Definitely not to be missed.
