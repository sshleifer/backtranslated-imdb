In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful of his dance partner, attempted to raise everyone and had no awareness of Riverdance's spirit. It's good he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male leader, is amazing, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Ivers' fiddling is astonishing (which is Noel Eccles' percussion) and Maria Pages' "Fire Dance" is worth the price of admission! When Sider and Ivers meet, at the end of the show for a musical duet, it's a real treasure. I agree, editing is not free, but no technical defect may deviate from this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one to get. There has never been anything like Riverdance! This is the right one!
