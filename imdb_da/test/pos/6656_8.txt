I saw Cold Mountain and the English patient again this weekend. The former is a civil war melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier telling the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he hardly knows. Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella, who does an unusual job. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwood's dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a compelling heroine. The English patient had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly cast as the clever, prolonged and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, who seems stupid and obscure and lacks that quality will make you believe Inman could be obsessed with a kiss. As an actress Kidman has a limited selection, she usually plays strict facial women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was too old to play the legend and love of the law. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For a person who seemed to be persistently contradictory and near hunger, she seemed ridiculously well fed and dressed. Kidman was so impeccably prepared that it looked like she had spent three hours getting make-up for each scene. Michele Pfieffer could have played the game perfectly in his younger days. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately intrusive, but her animated performance chewed the landscape, but perhaps she tried to compensate for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own quiet movie in the Odysseus role, but played his role well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / Southern villain. During the Civil War, people were probably not very well-educated by today's standards and perhaps they spoke in monosyllables. But if you see BBC adjustments of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill, are all articulated. Perhaps this is unrealistic, but it would improve my entertainment.
