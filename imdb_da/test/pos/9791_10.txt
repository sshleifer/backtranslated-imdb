This is just my all-time favorite movie. Nothing special. It's just so incredibly detailed. Make me cry just think about it. Geronimo Bill is the best guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spear is important. You don't need money to get what you need. If you need something, it just comes to you. If people would realize that the world would be a much better place. Whatever you do, don't make it for the money.
