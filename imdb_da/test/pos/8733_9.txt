I've been playing this movie continuously this month, and I just love it. I was around in the 60's (oh dear) so it's nostalgic in a way. However, it is the fun premise, the clever dialogue and the great ideas that keep me going. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reactions to Stephanie at the end of the movie are invaluable. (I would be more specific but don't want to spoil it for anyone.) Who other than Matthau can play a man not quite up-and-up and yet we still love him? As for Bergman's costumes, I think she looks as dowdy as she should. I think "she was robbed" when she appeared in an evening dress. It doesn't fit her, which is too bad. I never liked it when I first looked at her, and I still don't. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for his role. People thought it was a groundbreaking achievement at the time, and yet it is the only show I don't love as much as the others. However, she has the right amount of sweetness and equality that is important to this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great in it, and it's too bad that his movie career doesn't go after this. <br /> <br /> I hope more people see this movie ... they will love it!
