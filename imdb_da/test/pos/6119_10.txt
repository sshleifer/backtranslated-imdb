The movie that gave us John Waters is one of the funniest movies ever. Yes it can be rough, but it is filled with hysterical moments that no one has ever done. The infamous dog scene must be one of the highlights of the cinema. Not a movie to slightly offended it is one of those movies where you always see something new. Divine achievements are worthy of reputation. Mink chairs are hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the entire Gross-out comedy genre. I know what sounds a little extreme, but think about it. Before these comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical. After this movie comedies became weird and weird, but in a good way. I would give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
