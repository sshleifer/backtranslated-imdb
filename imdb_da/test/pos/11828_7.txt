I don't think this cartoon was as bad as some might think. Of course I was only five at the time it came out. But I found it very entertaining at that time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity. Batman and Robin were expressed by Adam West and Burt Ward was a good mark and gave me a sense of knowledge as I also look at the resumes of the campy 1960's live action show "Batman" of that age. This cartoon also introduced some new phrases I had forgotten about, for example. "Bat-Mite". Looking back on that, I'm sure he was probably as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much at the time. The best thing I can remember is his sound as a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Gee, I'm wondering why? :) Anyway, give it a look if you can and make your own mind. You may be surprised.
