Best years in our lives perfectly capture my youth's era and the feelings of that time. The molding was uniformly wonderful. This was possibly Dana Andrew's best role in his career, and he should also have been nominated for an Oscar. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all. The cinematography is among the best in any movie. This film is a time capsule of what was like in the 1940s. One must watch movies for any real movie fan. Some critics have said this movie is aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles that veterans return from the war will always be with us. This is just a fantastic movie - one that can be seen again and again.
