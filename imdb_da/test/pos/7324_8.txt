This belongs to their top level, although there were others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, who were more deserving of Oscar nominations than this one. But if nothing else, the recurring speaker message, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard" followed by Curly's "Woo woo woo woo," makes it a classic on two levels. First, it symbolizes everything Stooges represents; my daughter loves to repeat the message when she is in the middle of doing something stupid. Secondly, these are the absurdity of doctors in a hospital; I imagine the terror I would feel if I were a true patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the speaker. Throughout this brief you hear this message, and you know something terrible is happening, and the speaker's voice stays with you for months.
