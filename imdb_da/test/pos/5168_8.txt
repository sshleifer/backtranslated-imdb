The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it is mostly about the family. That's why some people call it "the children's vacation." As we get older, natural degradation and progress remove people and the things that gave us our special memories. John Denver plays in one of his sweetest roles George Billings, a successful NYC architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier. His life is focused on his 9-year-old daughter, Alex; Both are still providing for their losses. George tries his best to make this a special Christmas for her daughter. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (roguishly played by the wonderful colleague Flag of M * A * S * H ​​guy, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO to investigate a possible real estate deal. Located to her daughter, the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work, George and Alex fly into the city, where they immediately meet a collection of lovingly generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose greatest eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Georgetown is a picture book community, we all will love to live in and we will love the people for neighbors. George soon meets a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek.) If it wasn't for the grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. But in reality he is in town to find properties for Renfield to develop, and there is a lovely ranch near the city to be cut off and the dark edges of the film are about the impending foreclosure and reactions of townies, ranches and the outsiders. I won't ruin the end for those who have never seen the movie. It is a typically merry Christmas day, but it is handled in a rather subtle and credible way, showing the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy. All in all, this is a most comfortable way to spend a couple of your television hours. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have good chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a really good job. I have always loved Mary Wickes' work, a recognizable actress, and all the other cast members do a good job with less fleshy parts. This is a regular Christmas gift for my family; I rate it 4/5.
