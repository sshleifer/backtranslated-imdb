I recently seen Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it was a great crowd and some rather intense discussions. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the movie projects are amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy surrounding these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy. I've never heard of the actors before, but I liked all three very much. I think they did a fantastic job on their journey of self-discovery. All in all, this is an incredibly cool and exciting exciting movie. I still carry many of the pictures in my mind.
