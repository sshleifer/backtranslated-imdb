"The Couch Trip" is one of the silly comedies they crawled out in the 80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who constitutes a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to comment on Charles Grodin. Most of the movie's humor jumps out of their satirical look at Beverly Hills and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her girl). It's the kind of movie you just look to have a good time. Don't expect any kind of religious experience. But you will most likely laugh a lot about how the Beverly Hills people embrace their wealth. Also with Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (of "UHF").
