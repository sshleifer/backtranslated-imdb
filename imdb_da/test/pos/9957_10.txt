There were at least half a half dozen movie versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gone around making a big budget theatrical feature from the game. . . until now. Due to the character of the most memorable character, Shylock's unpleasant Jew, it is a good guess that the little unpleasantness that happened in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have dampened the enthusiasm of filmmakers. Sure of the main motivation for Michael Radford's new movie is to give Al Pacino a chance to shout, bend, crush, mumble and be tormented - all he is very good at. Like Richard III, Shylock's role is a dream of natural beauty. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an antisemit when he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before their time to some decades after his death; and it is unlikely that he has ever traveled abroad. At some level, Jews could just as well have been a mythological race to him. But while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his game is certain. Pacino gives Shylock a weird accent that is likely to suggest the smallest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th century money lender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawling on the Jews' miserable teratment and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who pleasantly spits on Shylock (Pacino), who just stands and holds his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker
