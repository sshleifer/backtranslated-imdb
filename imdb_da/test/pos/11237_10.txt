I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, 2 dudes are competed at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They blend the scenarios for each show so it's not the same every time. The panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize games. They will break down what the guy did wrong and what the guy did right. Some participants are weak, some are strong, but what's happening is always entertaining. If you are a guy who goes out, you can relate. I've seen weak games I've seen strong games and this show is too real. No doubt.
