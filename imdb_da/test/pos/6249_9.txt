One of the strangest and most frightening scary and eerie horror movies coming out of the 70s, "Tourist Trap", even by the loose, free-wheeling, convention-defying "everything goes" standards of its time rates as a real breathing. Still, the picture is very strange - a masterfully mounted spooky atmosphere of pervasive off-kilter supernatural fear, which from go-go is recorded as highly spooky and becomes more and more opaque and frightening as the film progresses and provides ample shock with a few scatter moments of surreally lovely dream-like elegance and ending in a bitterly ironic, crushing nihilistic note with a jerky end-image that is hard to shake - making it such a unique and unique unpleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers traveling through the deserted California desert by car are hopelessly lost. They stumble upon the "Slausens Lost Oasis", a seedy, rundown roadside dive, there is a part petrol station, three parts crummy wax museum, and all share ratty and forage. Sammy's lonely, seemingly vain and harmless owner, the Slaus (juicily overplayed with infectious hammy brio by Chuck Conners) turns out to be a fake psychic killer with deadly telekinetic powers. The Slaus brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortable human mannequins to life and fetches the children one by one so that he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppet Master" "Arrival") Schmoeller is probably teeming with every ounce of excitement he can squeeze from the pleasantly ambiguous and open script he wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (Saying script is stubbornly refusing to give a rational excuse to all the bizarre things that come out in the whole movie, often mistakenly criticized as one of the movie's main weaknesses, is actually the movie's key strength, which gives the image frightening, everything - and all-can-happen, common-logic-prohibited quality of a true nightmare comes horrific to life, which would never have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what happens.) Pino Donaggio's beautifully chilling, discreet score, Nicholas von Sternberg's shady filmography, and Robert A. Burns's gruff, narrow production design adds immensely to the film's deeply disturbing mood. Excellent performance is another important plus, with the beautiful, neat Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"), especially fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic to the endangered teens. Even Tanya Roberts is well known as a luckless lass who has a knife levitated in her head. Offbeat and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is worth a visit.
