The star war correspondent William Holden separated, falling in love with a fantastic Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones against the amazing backdrop of Hong Kong. The kinematics are magnificent as they rendezvous on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. History deals with racist tensions, society rejoices on mixed relationships and extra matrimonial matters. But what I love about it is the heroine strong character presented by Jessica Jones, a Eurasian physician who remains humble and firm in her altruistic mission and remains loyal to her love. Despite that, she is fired at her hospital to cavort with a married man by gossipe high rangers. In one day, William Holden is called the Korean War he covers, and then the bad day she gets the news of his death. Of course, the end is tragic, I cried when she went to their hill. It was a very sweet sick anchored love affair. It defeats all odds, the fact that she was fired from her job, how his wife would not give him a divorce, but their great love was persistent - they experienced a great love after all. I don't personally believe in extramarital affairs and think he shouldn't have started something when he was tied to another, and she shouldn't have allowed herself to do it, but despite that, it was a truly magnificent movie. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is hungry and gave a magnificent performance, though I thought it odd that they did not employ a true Asian actress or a person with Asian blood. I agree with a review, Jessica Jones radiates sexuality when she settles on the ground and looks up to William Holden, who speaks calmly, but her eyes say come take me now. I find it a pity that most amazing movies were made before I was born, it seems that many Hollywood movies lack depth, big acting and entirely dependent on stunts and heavy sex scenes. This is really one of the greatest fake love stories in movies.
