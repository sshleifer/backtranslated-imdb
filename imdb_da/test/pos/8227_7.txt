Ronald Colman plays a lost son. Though he is not a bad guy, he is a little fleeting and has not done much with his life other than traveling the world and having a good time. Now that his recent venture in Africa has failed, he is heading home to England. His rich top class father plans to throw him on his ear, but thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms. At this time there are two women in his life-showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (already engaged). How will all this work out and Ronald show himself and act as a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this cozy little movie. This is not a good movie and will certainly not change your life, but it is certainly very entertaining and fun. Most of this is due to Ronald Colman's always brilliant plays. Heck, in his career in the 1930s, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or another drunk and still made it entertaining and sympathetic because of his charming persona. His seemingly effortless style in this movie makes it very easy to like him, and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the movie! In addition, the writing is very witty and makes it a good romantic comedy.
