Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazing personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband - and the reality that may be the youthful joy and excitement of her younger years behind her. We learn a little about this woman's marriage, except that she has felt her independence slip away so late she has also recently learned that she is pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a complacent wife, despite by the mother's way, she speaks to her husband over the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who - after an accident during a game - has been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy, exciting motorcycle man who has a lot of trouble in his own life. The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely realized, like the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, poignant performances, especially as these are not very sympathetic people in conventional terms. Some scenes (like Knight's first call home from a payphone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the scared memories of his characters into scrapbooks we have been allowed to. He gives scenes the opportunity to play out, but editing is pretty imprisoned, and the movie must never be too heavy (there are at least two or three very fresh moments). It's a boring effort - so much so that the picture was still shown at festivals almost five years later. Some may dodge Coppola's unapologetic twist of events to emphasize the final with bitter irony, but the power and drive behind the image almost eliminates its shortcomings. *** from ****
