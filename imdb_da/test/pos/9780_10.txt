Having had a grandfather caught and sent to Changi during World War II, I was reluctant to see this when it was first screened on television. My grandfather kept a diary while in captivity, and when he died there, his comrades bought it back and I have been able to read it and feel that at least I have an idea of ​​what Changi really was , primarily. <br /> <br /> This is a great story of what happened to the bad blocks that were sent to Changi Prison and show what adversity and cruelty they experienced to protect their country. It's a great story about mateship, commitment and the Aussie Spirit, who will never give up attitude. It's worth seeing if you like Australian history or something to do with World War II. I enjoyed this mini lot and give it 10 out of 10.
