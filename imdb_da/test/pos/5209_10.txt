This film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made because it shows the soldiers' reality in a combat situation and the special circumstances of the battle of Stalingrad, obviously when comparing this film with works such as Anthony Beevor's book "Stalingrad" . <br /> <br /> Unlike the better known "Enemy at the Gates", where the plot is redirected to a sniper / hunting story, this movie shows what war can do for individuals. Although occupied by Germans, "Stalingrad" is anything but a nationalist apologetic film. It shows that war movies can be something beyond flagging, jingoist distortions of the gloomy war worthiness that so many Hollywood war products appear to be. <br /> <br /> The writing, acting, direction and other movie techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie for anyone considering joining an army and obeying orders from any kind of "Fuehrer".
