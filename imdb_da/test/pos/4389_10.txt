They loved him and turned him into a horny spout! God, it comes to me every time. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Memorable lines, from "Thank God, your mother died born, she saw you dead of shame" to "I don't understand, Big Dan." Big scenes, from the opening track (grin so grin I cried) to the bluegrass. <br /> <br /> See it. It's good, it's great, it's fun, and it's based on a famous story. Be sure of your time, believe me. Do not look at this if you have a weak bladder, for you will certainly wet your pants laugh.
