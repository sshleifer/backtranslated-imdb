I'm a big fan of $ 5.50 DVD bin on my local WalMart. Hopefully you have one at your local department. You can find a bunch of campy-flicks, a lot of waste and the occasional surprise. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this, and in thought it would be another cheesy kung fu laugh talk, I was really surprised at how good it was. I see many movies, and as a result I can almost always call how a movie will show up. And if there is a plot twist what it will be. Not this movie! The management is brilliant, the plot is amazing and the battles are incredibly inventive. If you see this, sit somewhere on a dirt-cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I still recommend it.
