You think the police are always right. <br /> <br /> You think "eyewitnesses" are always right. <br /> <br /> You think the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy you have failed to perform 98% of a basic survey. You think an American city might have "few bad apples" in law enforcement, but the "good police" quickly sipping those who systematically engage in evil for the sake of evil in the bud. You believe in the possibility that a soccer lineman will be instituted as a detective solely because his father is the county sheriff and allowed to beat "confessions" of randomly selected teens with absolutely no fear of negative consequences for himself in the 1930s America, but not today. You think a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if someone with a brain in the head can see the defendant being a random passerby neighbor by the police because it was hot and they didn't want to work that day. <br /> <br /> You believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months or 20 years there are "exceptions to the rule" and an injustice like this could never involve your family member, any middle class or anyone who you. <br /> <br /> You think you're aware of all the terrible, undoubted, 100% evidence for the last 10 years in America - but you haven't seen this movie.
