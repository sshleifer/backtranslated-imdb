"House of Dracula" is not so bad for a movie and is sometimes pretty decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> Arriving at Dr. Franz Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) in his bath home, Count Dracula, (John Carradine) is discreetly seeking a cure for vampyrism. He starts working on a potential cure for blood transfusion, Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives at his property and seeks a cure for lycantropy. He works with the two patients and discovers a possible cure in a form found near the lab, and after searching the area he finds Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. Being obsessed with reviving it, Dr. Edelmann neglecting Dracula's and Larry's requests, and having demanded that they get their treatment instead of working on Monster, they turn each other into a climactic showdown. <br /> <br /> The good news: It was a pretty decent movie. There is a main page that is totally creative and imaginative. This is the first film that openly suggests the idea of ​​vampyrism as a blood disease, and one that can be transmitted from person to person through the exchange of body fluid, something that would be taken up by later genre works, but rarely as directly as this. There is even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed to be responsible for the condition. It works in some pretty nicely used ideas and comes across as a pretty nifty idea, although some of the execution is a bit outdated. The fact that each creature has at least one standout scene is a nicely made idea. The wolf has a wonderful scene in which he transforms into a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and becomes crazy. Dracula's original look of showing up as a bat and flying towards a tended figure that sleeps and then appears in human form looks really impressive. Monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused. The big bat that Dracula turns into always looks decent at one time, and it is quite realistic. It's a thoroughly decent affair. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There are several things that weren't so great with this one. The fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really does not know what to do with them. There are several different back stories that need to be mixed together and that must be clear enough to mix well and seem coherent. This really has none of that. The plot is rather flimsy and does not give any preferential treatment to any of the stars, and instead concentrates on one and the other and then all three at the end. The monsters appear to be engaged to each other in the least possible reason, making it a major distraction. The conclusion is once a big disappointment, and seems to have changed at the last minute. There are a few other little things that were not so spectacular, and it also contributes largely to this. The Final Judgment: It's a pretty decent movie and manages to get through most with an entertaining style. Nowhere near the classic status of each monster's debut features, but it's a good enough clock for fans of monsters and universal movies in general. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Weapons
