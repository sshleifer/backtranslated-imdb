There was a lift film before this, and in fact Rififi was an obvious influence on it - but The Red Circle is more than just another post in an overcrowded genre, and with this movie director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something that both spans on the surface and gives the audience something to think about. Being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime film as weapons and gangsters, and Melville delivers it with this movie in cuddling; The tone of the movie is also very relaxed and melville allows the majority of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. The story has a number of angles, but the central character is Corey - a thief released from prison. His release coincides with the infamous killer Vogel's escape, which slides out under police commissioner Matthew's nose during a train ride. The first thing Corey does on release steals some money from his former boss Rico, and the other thing he does is recruit Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull off a jewel hoist. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The movie is bolted together by four excellent key performances. Alain Delon is calm and counts as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè looks formidable in her role as the escaped killer. François Périer is also good as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from André Bourvil in his role as police officer. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours and is not exactly an exciting trip. The director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film contains criminal films as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two-thirds of the movie just builds up to the exciting hoist scene towards the end. Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene where no one speaks a word. The hoist in this movie is the same because it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; But Melvil's skill in the direction and the calm and complex way it plays, do well. The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off fine. Overall, this cannot appeal to all criminal film fans, as the action is more than a little slow; But The Red Circle is an excellent movie and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
