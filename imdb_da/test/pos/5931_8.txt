Probably the best Royal Rumble this year. Match 1 sees the Edge battle Shawn Michaels in a good but very long game. Next up one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - Heidenreich goes on The Undertaker in a boring coffin fight. Match number 3 sees Bradshaw defending his WWE title against the Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good competition. Next fight up sees Triple H, defending his tenth heavyweight title government against Randy Orton in a big fight up. <br /> <br /> Next up, Royal Rumble finds out in which 15 Raw Super Stars and 15 Smackdown! superstars hit the ring to try to win the room and meet the master who may be at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights Included Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder gets his ass kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All the superstars beat crap out of Muhammad Hassan and Raw Superstars vs. Smackdown! Superstars! <br /> <br /> Not a bad PPV at all. <br/> <br /> Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Vinkel vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The Royal Rumble match - 9/10
