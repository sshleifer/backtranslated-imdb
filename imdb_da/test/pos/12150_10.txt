This movie is simply one of the best movies I have the privilege to own. It took me years to come up with this movie, and it was well worth it. The film is supposed to be propaganda against anti-drug, but becomes the opposite, not even halfway through the film. The relished look on the players' faces as they get their bounty of fabrics is gratifying for all those who observe. Until the final stage of their drug-induced life, heroin comes to mind. YIKES! This is the anti-drug announcement that was so sought after. The soundtrack to this movie kicks ass! It is by far the one of Pink Floyd's best albums ever! If ever the chance, take a look, listen, and the moment to watch a spectacularly made movie.
