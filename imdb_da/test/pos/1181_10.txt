Film does not always assume deep, provoked thoughts. Sometimes they are simply supposed to be escaping from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br /> A romantic comedy with a vintage vintage, Out To Sea, may not be a big budget, you might easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it is still very much a movie worth seeing on. A sweet movie to be given a break. <br /> <br /> This is just good, light heart fun. It's not supposed to be a deep movie. It is something worth looking at. If you have nothing else to see for Brent Spiner's humorous and uninterrupted release of Oye Como Va. Gil is a character you love to hate, and Mr. Spiner draws the perfect evil comic foil for two beloved comedy films.
