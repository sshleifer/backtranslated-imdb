When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN, he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insects in the lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his treasure, Miss Honey Bee, from the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> Although not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this movie was created), HOPPITY is an enjoyable movie that should bring joy to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality. The biggest drawback of the movie is that none of the characters really have any 'heart' - they don't come 'live' on the screen as Jiminy Cricket did a year earlier in PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> However, it is ultimately unfair to compare Fleischer Studio production with Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; Their contribution - and that would be a significant one - would be in the realm of a one-reel comic. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they created alternative realities as viable as all produced by other cartoon studies. HOPPITY was their second experiment with animation-length animation (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and from now on they will be using their energy again on the cartoon card subject. In fact, the first in the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already in release. <br /> <br /> HOPPITY's story owes much to Frank Capra, with it's energetic, you get her up against powerful social forces. In fact, the film's original title was MR. BUG goes to town, which immediately impresses Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their Capraesque adventure. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, known as Popeye's voice, speaks here for two very different characters, old Mr Bumble & Swat the Fly. Movie Mavens should be able to capture veteran poll actors Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both in unknown roles. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice songs from Hoagy Carmichael & Frank Loesser, of which "Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee" is the best known. "We are The Couple In The Castle" is a fine romantic tune that It is unfortunate that the film's first animation with its sweep out of the sky and past the in-depth New York skyline is covered behind the opening credits.
