I thought this is a wonderful written movie. I love little Scamp and the street-wise angel. This movie is very easy for young children to understand, but also a good movie for adults. I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and Tramp and that movie is a classic. Lady and Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, captivating songs, brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters. I've loved the movie ever since I saw it for the first time. I also loved how they showed the different personalities in each character. It also shows fallout and good things by making new friends you can hang out with. My favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the various characters sharing their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was the fan of the original Lady and Tramp.
