I don't have a really solid thesis here, so I just have to throw some observations. First of all, the film is absolutely beautiful. It is shot in high contrast black and white, and some of the scenes are so well composed that they are almost distracting. <br /> <br /> There is an order early on some intense protests, and some of the images were amazing - three guys are launching tear gas on the protesters, etc. Secondly, I believe that one of the greatest signs that this is a new movie looking back on the 60s is that it is really about how the idealism of revolution is morphed and shifted to something else. Taking this shift is really interesting - I believe that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self-forgiving phase have strong points and weaknesses. The movie does not necessarily take the view that things are due. <br /> <br /> Third, I think the romance works really well. Finally, I really really really hated the end. It was too melodramatic. You can even say that the end is unworthy of the movie that preceded it.
