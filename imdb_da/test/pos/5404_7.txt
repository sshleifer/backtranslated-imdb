This movie does not have the excellent images offered by American Beauty or The Ice Storm, and because it was made after these movies, it cannot be felt as very original either: the music, although subtle, sounds much like the American beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with the Isstorm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Without the intention, the film seems to try to restore the success of the two aforementioned films too much. Sometimes, the story tends to remain a little shallow, rather than being larger and more successful "brothers" by having too much going or not delivering the most effective dialogues. Here, the writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty. But it can be said of most movies ever made, even the best, and there is still much to like: said music scores and (expected, given cast) effective performances. Notice, Emile Hirsch, who would shine a few years later in the excellent "Into The Wild". Generally, I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas, although it is not the first on a list of must-sees that will be topped by: 1 American Beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 toddlers. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen and wanted them, check it out here.
