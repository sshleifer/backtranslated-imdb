Notorious HK CATIII actor Anthony Wong is for once (well ... not even - he was a policeman in the DARKNESS movie DAYS and a few others ...) not a psychopathic insecurity in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Normally recognized for its role as a complete wackadoo in such CATIII "nasties" as THE UNTOLD STORY and EBOLA SYNDROME - this time Wong is at the receiver of nastiness ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a guy who goes to a magician who promises to give him great dreams at a price. Believe in his words, the dreams that Wong has about having food canned sex with smokin 'hot schoolgirls - but dreams come with a price that is more than money. The wizard can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, harass Wong out of his money and business, kill his family and eventually kill Wong. Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on and finally finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out, Wong's brother is a beautiful dope ass sorrow and with the help of the wizard abused wife - changes the tables of the wizard and his arrangements. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more comfortable CATIII movies I've seen for a while. Absent is the cruel and dark feeling of some of the other CATIII posts as RED TO DEATH, UNTOLD STORY or MEN'S PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although it's fun in terms of sex and topic, is more "fun" then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "carefree" CATIII post that delivers plenty of nudity and a good deal of doing without being overly comical. Definitely worth a look, especially for the genre enthusiast. 8.10
