This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best I have seen. While it may not have the production value of some of the newer adaptations, it has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Jacobi's depiction of the disturbed prince is multilayer and riveting. His emotional patterns range from hatred to grief, love friendship and everywhere on the map, but without seemingly forced or over-the-top. In fact, some of the more powerful sequences arise when he teaches them, with silence, soft speech, and thoughtful expression. As for whether he interprets Hamlet as sour or sane ... yes, you have to decide for yourself. I changed more than once. At one point, it seems that he has believed himself and just plays madness, but suspects he's actually angry. A revelation to itself, captured beautifully. After performing Hamlet's part on stage several times than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity for the role comes as a little surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the production itself, it is presented as a kind of "filmed copy" of the stage game with small special effects or fancy camera work, minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to talk about. This production relies on the skill of the play and Shakespeare's words to elicit the emotions and interests of the audience. And it works. The other players are also top notch, especially Patrick Stewart's "Claudius" and Claire Blooms "Gertrude". Together, the casting gives a seamless ensemble. <br /> <br /> The last (but far from the least) element that makes this production stand out is the game itself. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. But strangely, I never noticed the time. I was busy getting caught in the story. I suppose you will too.
