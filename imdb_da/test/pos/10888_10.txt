You only have the best Italian suits from Armani, hand sewn and fitted to your precise measurements. Your car is the finest that German technology has to offer and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You are a member of the finest polo clubs that often eat in restaurants like Spago and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear weapon, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. You are skiing in the Alps, scuba diving in the Caribbean, sky diving over the Andes, and your hair is never out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's most famous spy, the best queen's favorite son, the British SS's bad boy and perhaps the most wanted man in the world. James Bond's character was created by Ian Fleming, and is the film industry's longest lasting icon that is the subject of over fifteen films spanning four decades. The latest man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took over James Bond's role from Timothy Dalton in 1996 and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the framework for the first major title developed by a third party on Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. Its continued dominance in the sales cards is merely evidence of how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most of the time, movie licensed games are flops. Although the two look like a good mix, the results have mostly been terrible. Play as Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the Star Trek flops, ammunition is probably against this mix. And for the record I'm not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if I've seen the movie. At least that was how I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than usual. Though it wasn't a bad movie, Goldeneye movie didn't have that much appeal to it, and I don't place it in the top ten of Bond movies. However, as a game, let's just say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first person shooter, and to be successful you must have at least as many brains as possible. For those who have seen the movie, which I imagine, most of you are reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the film with some variation. A plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, has begun in the Soviet Union, and in the process, a beautiful woman has been captured. Your missions will be many, the danger extreme. You have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most cruel missions the world has ever known. M will map you as soon as you are ready. Hello, James.
