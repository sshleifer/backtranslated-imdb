My friends and I watched the movie last night in Austin at a show for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and fervent - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience laughed at the whole movie. Texas is a great state - with lots of small towns - and of course lots of teenagers who grew up like "fat girls." I know that many people will relate to this movie on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were amazing - they were so good in these rolls, it was like the manuscript was written with them in mind. And if the script was very well written (very credible), and asa is a great actor (his facial expressions alone made me giggle). It's an independent movie - but don't let it fool you ... It's a good one! Seeing this caliber of work from such a young is truly inspiring.
