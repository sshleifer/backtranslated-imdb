Brighton has a traumatic drama in their family breast: The 20-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded because of a fall when she was one and her over-protective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories to Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railways. Evie sabotages the mystery of her interviews that various universities are being rejected and teaches her own poetry to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd) who thinks Emily has had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of poetry. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds Evie's reality triggering a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama of needy love and guilty complex. The performances are amazing and this is Lauren Ambro's first work, from "Six Feet Under", which I see, and she is amazing. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on the role of the play. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
