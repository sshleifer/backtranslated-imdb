The lives of three distinct and distant individuals cut each other with the brutal killing. The one-hour movie reveals only the event that brings the three people together only after half of the movie is over. I have seen other segments of "Decalogue", but one struck me as the most sparse in dialogue and yet most fascinating in the structure. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a law student practicing a mock defense for a man accused of murder. Of course, the same arguments must be repeated by the man as a fully-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the short 1-hour version of Decalogue 5). We are made to imagine that this may have been the case. A cabin driver who is a misanthrope has two facets in his character: the good side gives birth to a mangy dog, cleans his cab carefully, catches dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense, and remembers his wife while he dies ; the bad side scares little poodles, refuses to make a trip to a drunk - probably worried that he will puke in the cab - and donkeys on beautiful girls. The repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy, drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without provocation, is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and manuscript thus presents the good and bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> But the film is not about the death penalty, but more a treatise on killing. The fifth commandment: "Do not kill" is explored theologically - ("Even God saved Cain ..."), sociological tenderness of crimes for children and poor abandoned dogs and psychologically (aftermath of the drunken night with a male friend leading to him sister's accidental death, whose photograph he carries with him). What makes ordinary people kill - it's never quite explained, but suggestions are legion. <br /> <br /> In Kieslowski's world, there is a pattern where events and people are connected in cosmic sense (note the resemblance of the sound to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab). Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the command literally and figuratively - why are we killing? Are the people legally killed really badly? Is there a force beyond society (the drunk night that led to a girl's life) that makes us abominable killers? <br /> <br /> It would miss the forests of the trees to discuss the two ailed kittens in the movie - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to consider why we are asked by God not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a longer full length version of the movie was made by Kieslowski. But even this short one-hour version is great with its gloomy and scanty script, intelligent editing, interesting filmography and top-notch direction that gives much more than the sum of its parts. This segment predicts the healthier Decalogue 6,7 and 8.
