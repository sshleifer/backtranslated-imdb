Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a teacher housewife suffering from amnesia. She's even on PTA! But then an auto accident occurs the woman she used to be and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is fun as the low-rent private eye, trying to help Davis find her past, to find out he is in the way of his head. Davis also has some hilarious lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson seems surprisingly good. Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally manage to throw his St. Elsewhere TV picture. The film is directed by Davis' man, who almost seems to have built the whole movie around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> I pull out this DVD and often relay it. I still love the makeup scene. Is Geena hot or what?
