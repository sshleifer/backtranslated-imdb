As one who often goes to the cinema, I have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies I've seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave excellent performances that allow viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel the characters. It is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend solely on special effects, but allows the characters of history to touch the human psyche on many levels. I want Hollywood to produce more movies of this caliber.
