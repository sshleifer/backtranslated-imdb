I love this movie, it is excellent and so fun, Ben is FIT and I didn't mind meeting him on vacation !! I rate this movie a 10 because it is gr8 and I hope they never get it again because it would never be the same. Calm bit is wen Others look at the moon, and he shouts at Nicole to "get outside and look at the moon", that bit always makes me laugh and never get old. Another thing is Nicole looks much older than 14 ... but is an Gr8 actress. But I need help with something Have n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen Nicole and Andre dances ??? Its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because it's a good song !!
