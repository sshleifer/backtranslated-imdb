This is a great movie to watch as it was so nicely directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I wanted the film to have more depth in it as far as its story is concerned. It's a historically relevant movie about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film forgets to focus on character's motivations, which may make the movie a bit too low to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie for what. <br /> <br /> Somehow it doesn't make the movie any less good to see for yourself. It is made with passion and eye for detail. Everything about the movie looks good, for example. its settings, costumes and camera work. The story still seems so powerful, but at the same time it could have been so much better and more powerful with a little more character development and insight historical information. Guess if you are fully acquainted with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this movie will be the perfect one to see. <br /> <br /> It is a bit typical for a French movie to tell a story slowly and subtly, without going into much detail. This often seems charming, but in this case the film could really have made a little more depth. Apart from that, this film is still a good example of French cinema, despite being led by a Polish director and stars also lots of Polish actors in it. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is great in his role, even though the film also decides to concentrate a lot on many other characters. The movie may have a bit too many characters, but each performance is a big one, so it won't really be a big deal, except that it delays the story a bit at certain points. <br /> An amazing movie that could have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
