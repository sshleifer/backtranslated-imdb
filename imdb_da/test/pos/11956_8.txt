If I ever write movies or do them, I would have one of them to be like this. I enjoy the goof ball sense of humor and jokes contained in. This movie does stupid things without looking like that. Names of places and signs are invaluable, Generic New York High School, Octopus Calimari (George's sister), etc ... genius. I've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable TV staple while I was growing up, of course I didn't get all the jokes back, but it was still fun. This movie is a timeless classic.
