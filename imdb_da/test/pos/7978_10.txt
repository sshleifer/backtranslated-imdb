This is a cute little movie that gives virtually what it promises - a great entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it contains top SASS shooters, you should note that it is not a likely candidate for "Best Picture" Oscar. The guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that the movie does not star Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, ie. You should not expect to see the current hottest names. It was supposed to be just plain old entertainment, and in that respect it is as good as many of the old "oaters" I've seen over the years. So what do you get with "Hell to pay"? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You get the chance to see some stars from the last few years that work pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older. You will see some good SASS shooters in larger roles and a few SASS ham in the background. It was very fun for me to see people I have shot with, visited in their home, and who are my good friends, get to do something that many people only dream of - they are in a real, living honest to gosh movie. They make a lot of wannabe actors, and wannabe shooters never get the chance to do that, and I think it alone makes it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, not all SASS members are, and so I saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly there is a lot of movie in the theater right now that i would not give a nickel to watch, so scared money to see "Brokeback Mountain" get "Hell to Pay" and see some real cowboys have fun.
