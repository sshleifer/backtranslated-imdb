I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was that of Bridges of Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to pull it out, which gives a very good performance, and so does the rest of the throw. The direction is imaginative considering that the film was made in 1971 and there had been no plot holes - as the director seems to struggle to cover up at times - we would talk about an excellent movie. It's still powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
