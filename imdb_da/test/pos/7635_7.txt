L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or SEXORCIST, or the ridiculous title EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST rip-off that features one of the best horrors I've ever seen. The scene is when the junction comes alive. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (large FXs). It is a shame the rest of the film does not maintain the level of fragility exemplified during that scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. Imagine the producers who decide to make an exorcist copy, but when they do, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (an obsessive sculpture of crucified man who is shocking when you think about it), but then forgets totally their original idea of ​​making a boring and uninspired EXORCIST rip-off. Had the movie continued with the obsessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this movie would have rocked. But when the girl becomes obsessed with the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. She and the script completely forget the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like so-called "Euro-cult" movies, the first 45 minutes live unlike any other Euro-cult movie. But after the stage, when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatized, the remaining 45 minutes suck. Boring. It does not go fast as it tries to imitate (badly) the EXORCIST. Then watch the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the 1970s fashion, sleaze and the amazing statue-come-live-to-ravish-the-girl scene, but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and eject, and maybe as good as cut your toenails.
