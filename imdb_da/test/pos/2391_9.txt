I found the movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie, the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny Uncle was wonderful He was genuine in his character. The end took a wonderful twist. I'd recommend seeing you. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me of a little sandy bullock, she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls who appear in the film, she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of one of my friends who really lives his life in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pool because that's how most people cook. I actually saw the movie twice and learned more the second time.
