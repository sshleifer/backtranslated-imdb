Although this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome, others thought it was fun, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. This episode was fun and just shocking. South Park has made the story as their first episode with the most cuss words unless you count the movie as an episode. I enjoyed it, they did fun with Chris Hansen and his TV show, catching a Predator. I did not like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen wanted to make a show on tourettes and let a boy talk and bash the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like is how South Park believed the people with tourette's syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that. I've seen people on TV with Tourette's syndrome, and they don't just beat out bad words. Unless I'm wrong.
