I'm sure people from the United States don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they shouldn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not like hypocrites like the United States. The only places where teenage consent is illegal are the United States and Islamic nations. In France, for example, Age of consent 15. In Brazil it is 14. In Spain it is 12. So teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old at the time of production do not do anything illegal. Emergency is not considered a big deal in almost all civilized countries. And only a freak could consider teenager's love as a child rape.
