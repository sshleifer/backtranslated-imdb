just got back from watching this great funny movie. <br /> <br /> part of the reason I loved it, it was because I could point out people and places I knew ('I go there every day!' 'I work there!', 'I have had drinks there! ',' hi! it's our postman! 'etc). But still, if you're out for a 'feel-good' with a little spice (sorry excuse) - that's just the right answer. relationships, culture and most importantly, love is all interwoven in the plot. <br /> <br /> with preston (where the movie is tuned), which has recently become a city, it is good to see this work with the place and add to the feeling of uprise. It is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north. fabulous!
