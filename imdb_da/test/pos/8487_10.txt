Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a moment, you stop watching a movie and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was really a genius of music and the movie well depicted it. Nobody ever or will ever write, play or record music like this musical giant. As he passed meat, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the movie, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music schoolship for college and could play as Ray was an asset to the director. What could be better than that? You don't have to have a "double" piano and then try to split the screen from the hands of others to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also addressed how hard Ray was. He wasn't always a good man. You don't even have a mess for him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes it's just hard-driven. But I think that's what made him genius, so I can't fault him for that. I choose Jamie for best actress!
