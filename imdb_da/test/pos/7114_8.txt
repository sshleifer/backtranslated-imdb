This is another universal fun filled scare party. Many people will compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Although it has similar cast and same director, it can stand on its own. (It seems that Erle C Kenton directed most of the 40's Universal acting films). Plot Strap: Baron Latos appears at Dr. Eidlemann's home and seeks a "cure" for his vampireism. Larry Talbot (who somehow survived the House OF Frankenstein) also shows up by the good doctor's door seeking a cure for his suffering. After a failed suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor find the Frankenstein monster. To complicate conditions just before he bites the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor turns into a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. Where it leads is something you should see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Carradine actually offers a very good performance like Dracula. He does not chew on the stage as he wants in later roles. It is difficult to suppress giggles when he appears in a top hat. The cap / jacket is traditional, but the hat must go. Where does the hat go when he switches to a bat ...? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens provides an excellent portrayal of the doctor. He is torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood flow he now tends to. This is a very underrated performance. Chaney brings even more life to Wolf Man in his fourth appearance in that role. <br /> <br /> The monster is not much to do this time. Just put on the table until the end (some stock footage from Ghost Of Frankenstein used). At least in the House of Frankenstein he was up and about a bit. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sticks to the basic Universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running wildly with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. It gets a low 8.
