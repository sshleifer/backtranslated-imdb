The original The Man Who Were Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock recognition for the first time outside the UK. Of course, part of the reason for the recognition was that people were wondering how Hitchcock could give so much on the screen in such a dirty budget over sumptuous Hollywood products. The original film was shot in a studio. <br /> <br /> For some reason he chose this from all his remake movies, and Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a large Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decided to see what the Man who knew Much would be like having a sumptuous budget. This is shot on the spot in Marrakech and London and has two major international names for ticket office. This was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only team with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock movie. I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she would take care of the profile of blonde leading ladies whom Hitchcock preferred. Perhaps because her wholesome screen was unlike the sophisticated Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Were Too Much. Her best scene is when her teacher James Stewart gives her a sedative before she tells her son has been kidnapped by an English couple who were friends with them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially since she records four different emotions at once. Day and Stewart are on holiday with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco, and they are acquainted with Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stuck in the back of a market in Marrakech and whispers some dying words to Stewart about a murder taking place in Albert Hall in London. Their child is shaken to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock movie. Doris actually plays a well-known singer who went from stage to wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera, and I remember it well at the age of 9 years. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, even competing with the fast-growing Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song, which released titles like True Love from the High Society and the title song from Around the World for 80 days. It became Doris Days themed song for the rest of her life, and she is still going to come back. In fact, the song worked pretty nicely into the plot when Doris sings it at an embassy party in the climax. <br /> <br /> Instead of mirroring, Hitchcock shot the scene of the murder at the real Albert Hall, and as another reviewer said it was not corrected, it was choreographed. You will hang on your seats at that moment. <br /> <br /> This was remake worth doing.
