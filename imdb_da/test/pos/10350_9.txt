I'm so happy that I lost this movie when it came to the BBC last month! It blew my mind, so intestinal and true. David Tennant is absolutely fantastic in this, although his character is not always easy to identify or identify with. The final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart, those eyes .... I guess he made this movie between Dr. The Who series, and it makes it even more of a performance for me. I just love Dr. Who, and yet I saw nothing of him in Mr. Tennant's portrayal of this man who knows he has changed and struggles to create a kind of new identity and life. <br /> <br /> great little intense drama!
