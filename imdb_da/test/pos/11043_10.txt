The magnificent Greta Garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. She gets good support from the rest of the casting, which includes Charles Bickford's sturdy sailor who catches her heart. Mrs. Garbo gives a good performance, which she usually does as the alienated daughter of a sea captain returning after fifteen years. Also in the cast is the great actress Marie Dressler. A good movie!
