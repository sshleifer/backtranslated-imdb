I look in the TV guide to movies coming from Germany, and I found one called The Bunnyguards, so I saw it and I laughed myself silly! I wanted the DVD, but it's not available here (I could order it from Germany, but it doesn't have subtitles) It was played again, so I taped it and watch it from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I searched for information about it and found out that the real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know it by its Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany don't like Erkan & Stefan Because of their accents, but not German myself, I didn't mind. The jokes are good, but some Germans can find their accents off-putting. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun and if the DVD had English subtitles on all extras (has a 2-edition with only the subtitle function would be bad) I would buy it up in a moment! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
