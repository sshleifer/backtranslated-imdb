Haines is excellent as the brash cadet, who believes West Point will really match something now that he has come. Haines shows off his lightweight, greasy cartoon persona when taking on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Fun for the first half. And amazing touches after Haines character go too far and are almost cut off by co-cadets. The new humility-filled Haines gets its last minute to play in the bill football game against the fleet and despite a broken arm wins the game. Great, entertaining entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy as his best. William Bakewell also scores as the thin supporter. The beautiful but-goony character will be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in recent decades, another taking on the beautiful but daffy ladies played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!
