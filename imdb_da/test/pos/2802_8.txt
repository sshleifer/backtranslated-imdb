One of the biggest French successes in the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well met abroad, which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of these years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and gathered everyone under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those you imagine or see in everyday life: either unclear, either seriously or with a sense of humor. I assume that if the film worked so well, it is because many students must have recognized themselves in the protagonists' portraits and especially Xaviers. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and thus his experience abroad as an Erasmus student through his eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his mistakes. An intelligent presentation with a lot of brilliant ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety over the world and is an Erasmus student. On this topic, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the papers he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs him of the various necessary procedures, all the papers on the screen appear when she names them! In the next order, Xavier's voice-over confronts the viewer with his view of the modern world. Now, where do you find the second example? The scene where Xavier has a thorough medical examination where Klapisch films his visions is big enough to talk about himself. <br /> <br /> Also, the instructor was not really interested in his protagonists' studies. He left this point low key. He makes a lot of effort in Xavier's private life of course in his love affair with Anne Sophie, but also and especially in his relationship with his fellow riders. It is a true friendship story that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness, but also its arguments and tensions. Through Xavier's adventures and at the end of his stay, he will have been initiated into life, which will make him more mature. The message that the author wanted to transfer is not hard to guess. You naively believe that you live in a sloppy and complicated world. Do not give up, but intensively seek to get what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, we could also fear that Cédric Klapisch, with the subject, would not avoid a trap: the clichés. Let us be honest: they are included in the manuscript, but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie. Then, the manuscript contains convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding, we see that Xavier is tearing after leaving his family. But fortunately the script is missing here. Quite quiet dialogues and cool young actors who are completely confident in their roles make up everything. <br /> <br /> Despite the weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" must be taken for success in the youth movie. In addition, the whole atmosphere brings us to believe that this film is primarily aimed at a young audience. In the end, the end of the film and its great success allow us to suggest that Klapisch bowed to a fashion that goes straight to American cinema: the preparation of successors. And in fact, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel entitled "les poupées russes". Let's hope it will be as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
