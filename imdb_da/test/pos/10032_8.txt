When you stop to remember Errol Flyn's and Olivia DeHavilland's frequent on-screen teams, "the dead with their boots on" (1941), it is most likely that the film was best remembered. It is the sweeping saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the time he enters the West Point Military Academy and falls for the delicious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland) during his term of office during the American Civil War and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director Raoul Walsh puts his historical epic on the laurels of highly dubious recovery of historical texts, rewritten by writer Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are out of proportion. Therefore, the fight against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as an uneven agreement between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and an involuntarily absent company wishing to regain that country, Custer gave Indians through Nationals systematic genocide first peoples. <br /> <br /> Flynn, who wisely plays Custer as being part of Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more unclear. He literally eats charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner actors Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver amazing comos that seem to have much more depth and character than actually written in their material. Overall, despite its loose history reproduction in favor of a good romantic yarn, "the dead with their boots on" are abundant film feeds for a Saturday matinee or Sunday night cooing with one's sweet. Warner's DVD is pretty nice. Although film grains are often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely reproduced with deep, solid black and very pure whites. Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The sound has been very nicely cleaned and presented at a suitable listening level.
