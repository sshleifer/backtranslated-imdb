Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in movies. But it was pretty close to tears. It really got me when Radio's mother died and he just didn't want to get out of his room. I felt really sorry how, if you were mentally retarded, you couldn't really understand death. I really liked the movie and it's a must see.
