How would you feel if you only had a few weeks left to live? This movie helps you know through the eyes of a guy who is facing that situation. It is told with sympathy and without many emotions. Some may feel quite slow - but I think it adds to the realism of the movie. Some may see it as a love story, but I find it secondary to seeing its last days through his eyes. The love of life is part of the end of his life and gives it more influence. Low key and gentle, the film rolls out the story a lot as life does. Without clich√©s and with unexpected events set against passing by. If you like your movies gently emotionally realistic, it may be for you.
