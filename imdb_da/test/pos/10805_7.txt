I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu excursion, plus the time period is certainly fascinating. Being a Wajda fan, I was disappointed and it can be an understatement. The film has never really taken film flight - there is no basis for the animation between Danton and Robespierre etc. Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, afterall! There were also some amazing actors, but they never really grasp the audience's attention as they should. Depardieu comes out as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant Danton ... not exactly the picture we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible as usual, but again the script sets limits, even actors of great talent cannot break down. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda show up ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you are familiar with Wajda, then you would know them. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was disappointed with this very rewarding movie. Great cast, fantastic instructor, but no quality base. Bad, undynamic script. We have to get into Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) mindsets ... What is their motivation? Eh ... who knows? You like women, the other powders themselves? Riiight. Okay, so if you're looking for a big French Revolution movie I highly recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's in two parts and so good! Excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy time bits ... definitely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn has apparently taken some notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. SEE IT! NOW! As for Wajda fans - you are better off with "Man of Iron / Marble", "Promised Land" and the like. Cheers !!
