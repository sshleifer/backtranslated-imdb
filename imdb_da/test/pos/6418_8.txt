OK ... The end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before ... And Klaus Kinski should have got his 10 second look cut out ... But there is no one to get away from the fact that this is a truly wonderful atmospheric Euro thriller ... I can't believe I've never seen this until now ... It's good to know there are movies out there that are still worth tracking ... And that is it really ... Stunning visuals ... Haunting ... And building a great atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is some of the most relaxed and perfect plays you could see ... Lila Kedrova is the place to be a fellow visitor to the city, who may or may not be, as she seems ... If you miss high days in the Euro cinema, chase this out ... There is a decent widescreen - print that goes around ... And please get it out in a restored DVD somebody ... They did it with directo The riders "Fifth Line" ... And this is a much better movie
