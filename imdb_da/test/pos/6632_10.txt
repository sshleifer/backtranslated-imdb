Shame represents a highlight of the career of a master. Ingmar Bergman pervasive, existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland, which is concerned with surviving a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painstakingly detailed performances in this extraordinary, dramatic drama. The film's intensity rests in Bergman's preservation of the focus on the immediate, intimate relationships between his two characters - both musicians obtained - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand. We see that the external pressure of war complicates and corrodes their relationship. Both signs are forced by the material circumstances of war to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with Ullman's character, which has been edited and distorted for political effect on one side of the conflict and on the other hand, is used as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
