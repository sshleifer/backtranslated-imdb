The title suggests that this movie is a successor to "An American Werewolf in London". None of the characters from the previous movie remain and are not even mentioned in this movie by name. So, as a successor, AAwiP fails to say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a charming, effective horror movie. It's one of the better werewolf movies I've seen for a long time too. And I've seen my part, like an American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy. <br /> <br /> The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eifelt tower one of them rescues a woman who tries to commit suicide. What starts out as a romantic relationship slowly becomes a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed ... I really liked the play in this movie. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saved her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles nicely. I really didn't find anything annoying about the play, so thumbs up for it! <br /> <br /> The effects on the werewolves are good. It doesn't look too cheap or fake for me. Of course, the opinions are divided on this topic. But let's just say I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some really fun scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. So to sum it up, a US werewolf in Paris can't be a direct successor to that predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie. Perfect for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
