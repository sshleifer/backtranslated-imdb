Seeing this hilarious retro but very entertaining career girl tale, I became the floor of Joan Crawford's first appearance. All I could think of was initially: "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his infamous booking picture!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes into the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange come out of a cabin in Greenwich Village. As they walk down the street, you can see part of a sign behind them for the Stonewall Bar - scene of epocal "rampage" that is considered the trigger for the modern gay movement. <br /> <br /> Talking about Baker and taxis, I had to laugh when she enters one and tells cabbie, "56th and Sutton Place, thank you - and be careful about the bumps." Can you imagine the reaction of a driver in today's Manhattan? She says of course because she is pregnant and does not want to harm the fetus. But it does not stop her from jumping out of a car when she finds out that Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Now they had to find a way for her to lose the child (1959 and all). Sue Carson is lovely as Mary Agnes. Why was this her only movie? There is no biographical information about her in IMDb.
