After discovering the Ring Trilogy, I have greedily gobbled up all the other Japanese and Korean films that are either on or after the bandwagon. I don't have an easy definition of horror, but this movie probably printed some of my buttons, though I can't claim that the movie makes a lot of sense. I'm squeamish, so there were several points in the movie as I just didn't want to see what happened on the screen. The movie confused me, so I became anxious to see things I thought I should see. <br /> <br /> It's an imaginative movie that gives a great deal of visual. It also gives food to thoughts. And lots of material to argue when the movie is over. <br /> <br /> The characters are well-defined for the least. Could they make movies like this in the West? So it does not make sense in the end, but when you have an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the other world, then no movies will deliver a final all-explaining pay-off.
