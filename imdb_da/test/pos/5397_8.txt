Enjoyed this movie, which is all about an average family, so it seems. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in a son who is great for swimming and winning many trophies, but he hates it a lot and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his second son, Tim, (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter, Penny, (Michelle Williams) who is fortunate to be away in college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband too. A very tragic event happens in the family that changes everyone's personality, young and old begin to use drugs, smoking pots and drinks all the time at parties. There is even a gay scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
