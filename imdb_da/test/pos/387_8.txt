Although some unrealistic things happen at the end (ie a policeman shooting a gun in a crowded career where any innocent could be killed), it was still an intense and fun thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincingly giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is okay, but is no match for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock movie with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent people in trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other movies, I thought this was a fast-moving story with a few dull spots. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old online games that contained some good collections. Hitchcock's real daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of her father; she can act Note also: the DVD has both the British and American versions, and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic movie still referred to in modern movies, even comedies like "Throw Momma Off The Train."
