The very few reviews I could find online at Children's Island really do not do it justice. I read them all before I ordered the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already been reviewed so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very happy now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give an overview of the plot because other reviewers have already done so. But I would say that I do not understand comments that it is gloomy, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic. It is certainly very unusual, as I suppose, to make it seem strange to some people, but the other criticism must reflect the judges' own problems because I did not see anything in the movie I was just watching. I'm not attracted to boys so nudity didn't seem pornographic at all - it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is without help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it is Sweden, not Utah, so topless women are not that big. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me the most is how positive the film is in its depiction of this gutsy-lost child who goes on a kind of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences seeking - and ultimately find oneself. It is fascinating, thoroughly original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I am not at all surprised that Barnens√∂ won three major Guldbagge awards, for best film, direction and actor, but I am completely amazed that the Actor who won was not Tomas Fryk, the child, whose fearless appearance as Reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, Reine's mother's cunning girlfriend. I don't understand it at all, but it doesn't change that this is a good movie.
