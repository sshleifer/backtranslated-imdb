/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it doesn't matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin is a great show of haunting images. The visual direction is (and has been) inspiring, the film's pure scale is impressive, and the technique is certainly groundbreaking. What really is amazing is, in my opinion, the depth and efficiency of a movie, without proper literary script, sound (scared audio track), decent picture quality, today's faux-depth (self) referentialism, unusual acting, pretense, etc. What You get is a pure visual experience to remember. <br /> <br /> BTW, the previous poster noted: "The Eisenstien felt after much suffering to give the heroes what they wanted. The problem is that you think Eisenstein is building up a big final fight and then he tastes you "It's a little cheap. I'd rather have seen a huge final action scene." I have to warn you The end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not generous for the heroes. The story was, however. Potemkin really went through the squadron as it was shown in the movie. Finally, I would highly recommend watching the battleship Potemkin anybody more or less seriously interested in cinema. Watch it with a movie, it kept me talking for hours. But if you tend to consider movies that are generally accepted as "big" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you yet. Not very cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me it is a full 10/10.
