As a lesbian, I'm sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on television as a sad person, forever vacillating between suicide and murder, but never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are tired of Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you will breathe in relief on this wonderful offer from the BBC. Nan Astley is the daughter of an oysterhouse restaurateur who "wonders why she can't feel like she's about Freddy" (one of the local guys who has her eye on her). She's falling ?? and fall hard ?? for Kitty Butler, a male successor with a visited theater troupe. Nan comes with Kitty to London as his dresser ?? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is pleasant in this story, and some of the things she does are not appalling either - but she will win your heart and her story of love triumphantly will leave you with a beautiful lump in the neck at the end. <br /> <br /> If you are a lesbo-hating macho man or a homosexual housewife or any brand of religious fundamentalist who thinks homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and you believe in love, you will cry at the end as much as I did!
