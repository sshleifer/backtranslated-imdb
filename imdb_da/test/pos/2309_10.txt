Especially when looking at the amount of crap that made it DVD. I found this movie a lot of fun. Rip Torn is classic with its barbs; Rob Schneider whose hilarious annoyance as overcompensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a big "villain". The whole cast seems to have a blast and it is not at the expense of the audience. If you like just plain funny comedy, and don't look too deeply into meaning, just fall in love with it.
