I think this movie is entertaining, though it lacks some features that are crucial to this kind of movie. First and foremost, when Doug and Chappy start their mission, they set off with F-16B, and under the combat scenes they control F-16A. The other thing I don't like in this movie is the ever-repeating F-16 that rolls to its right to escape from missiles ... why coffee and fluff have not been shown in any movie yet? Third, when you see F-16 almost out of ammunition, lots of missiles are again displayed ... the models used to simulate the broken aircraft are also not good. But I think that using IAI Kfir as opponent's plans was really good, far better than F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie is not as good as the masterpiece). A fun movie I love flying and I have seen it more than 3 times.
