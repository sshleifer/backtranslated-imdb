Miles O'Keeffe again assumes the powerful Ator's role in this first sequel to the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The reason is ridiculous, the script is terrible, the play is hammy everywhere, the special effects .... let's not even go there! - All in all, this movie is a real joy! <br /> <br /> The highlights of the movie include Ator and Thong (his dumb companion, not his underwear) being attacked by the invisible attackers in a cave (certainly hidden in the budget there!) Ator struggles with what should be the most compelling giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course the infamous hangliding scene! <br /> <br /> There is one question I have, though ... at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator probably destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us). .. where in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage to get out alive? Did he mature any kind of primitive timer / detonator or something? <br /> <br /> Oh yes, such an illogical ending really only adds to the overall charm of the movie - they just don't make them like this!
