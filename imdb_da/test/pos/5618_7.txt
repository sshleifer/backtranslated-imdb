I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to do two things in this movie. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, who is considered the best violin success of the last century. Secondly, he has brought the Dead End kids on display with his movie of the same title and seen them signed with Warner Brothers, and he was trying to create another gang of appealing urchins. <br /> <br /> Although the film was good, the children from this movie were not required to be reteamed for another function. <br /> <br /> The leader of the band is Gene Reynolds, who at one time played the violin, but now leads a street bench of unpleasant urchins. His father-in-law, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin, his late father gave young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform the school of weak protests from his mother Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds happens to stumble upon a music school run by the old music era itself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take him in, but they have their financial problems with many creditors led by Porter Hall. This movie is mostly seen today because it is a chance for classical music lovers to watch and hear Jascha Heifetz as you gather is somehow the solution to everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this movie, but has a rather colorless part as Andrea Leeds boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Besides the Heifetz, one thing the movie does is touch, though gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses. Arthur Hohl is a mighty man, and Marjorie Main is very clearly a very violent wife. <br /> <br /> The kids in the throw are doing well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl named Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, nightclub partner of Nelson Eddy. She had a good soprano herself as a child. <br /> <br /> But it's the Heifetz you see the show for.
