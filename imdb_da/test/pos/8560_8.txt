Of course it goes into what one expects it to be a typical, stupid T&A flick, and that is. But it really has some pretty thoughtful humorous moments. Considering the era in which it was made and the obvious utilization aspect, it is still one of the better B-comedies of the time. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you will surely see the inspiration for many of the scenes in "The Revenge of the North" and many other films of the same genre. Most of the play is terrible and WAY over the top, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like this. What it lacks in terms of the ability to act, is more than that which cuts off its rental value and complete disregard for some of the profits. The amazing thing about this movie is that there was of course some money that went into it. Movies like this made today just don't have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and turn your sense of humor into an hour and a half, you will enjoy this flick. I dare to find at least something in this movie that they think is funny, if not funny.
