This movie is amazing, but not perfect by Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the broad division between rich and poor, black and white, which is true in many parts of the world. It handles the audience with children's gloves, while delivering a true look at social problems. The children are beautiful, notice the young man playing Sipho. The friendships that are developed are universally true, everyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken from real life experiences as there is a snap of conversations and interactions - just as a child will remember to experience. I would highly recommend this movie.
