Brain of Blood starts as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death due to cancer, but if he dies, Kahlid will tear himself apart without anyone leading them so doctor Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) of Amir's devoted Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) has devised a plan to take Amir's death body to America, where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain to a fresh body and with a little plastic surgery no one will ever know he was dead. Things don't go according to plan, but when the time comes to transplant Amir's brain Trenton's freak assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body of someone who fell from a balcony, trenton needed a strong fit living body and then no if more time he decides to use Gors body as a temporary stop gap until another more suitable one can be found. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in her new body, is he not very happy with what he sees, I think you would be if you found out that your brain was in a badly burned freak? Also known as Brain Damage, Brain, Creature Revenege & The Undying Brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced and directed by one and only Al Adamason and frankly I am offended at the pathetic 1.5 rating Brain of Blood has on IMDb, personally I think It's great fun in such a bad thing, it's good kind of way. Kane W. Lynn & Joe Van Rodgers very entertaining script is as bleak and silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplant to bile wild scientists from 7 foot tall acidic freaks, playing with toy cars to 4 foot high midget medical assistant, from basement hole holes to timber hunting, from car crashes to the murder, kidnaps to screaming tailor-made women from Regina Carrel's hardcover, who should make it even to mention under the opening grants for teenage girls imprisoned in the basement to make blood laugh-high obedient ending, which contains some deep meaningful talk! This is where the Brain of Blood has quality cheese stamped over it, if your fan of low budget spending flashes with fun, then this movie should be at the top of the list of "must see" movies. Despite being a low 1.5 rating, I am proud to admit that I liked the Brain of Blood a lot, I thought it was an absolute hoot to see, it lowers a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people walking around doing nothing in particular but until that time it had moved like a rocket, in just 85 minutes it is relatively short, it is hard to settle for forgetting the barmy plot and i just think it is plenty of campy fun. <br /> <br /> This is director Adamsons masterpiece as far as I'm concerned with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971), which he made a year before this. Those who have seen an Adamson movie before will know about the no existing production values, cheap special effects & cardboard sets, and all of which add to the fun, this movie handles it nicely between incompetence and seriousness to create a memorable experience. I love the opening shot of Kahlid, which of course is just a picture of the Taj Mahal in India, complete with statues of the foreground! Regina Carrel's hair seems to be a self-contained unit on its own, it seems to change styles between shots and is frankly horrible, don't let me start on her makeup task, nor should she apply with a paint sprayer! There is another fun moment when we see Amir's body being transported to America wrapped in what looks like plain tin foil, why is the question I asked myself why! The effects are variable, there is a horrible-looking fake spider, Gors burned-up job is pretty bad, although there is a surprising gory brain removal that is actually quite impressive. The budget for the Brain of Blood I have hardly existed, I have to admit that I thought Trenton's lab was quite good with various computers and medical instruments, although the rest of the movie looks cheap and nasty. The production values ​​are low, the music was taken from another movie Beast of Blood (1971) and the play is terrible, but in a campy fun kind of way. <br /> <br /> The Brain of Blood can have the best title for a movie ever, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a very entertaining piece of nonsense that I had fun watching and laughing at. They just don't / can't make them like this anymore, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie, but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I liked it, but then I'm just weird.
