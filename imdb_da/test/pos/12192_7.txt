Despite the pans of the reviewers, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked it better than Interview with a vampire, and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise Trial. All the major players from the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and half a dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the most important players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). In spite of other reviews, I also believe that this film and music were true to Anne Riss's depiction and ethos, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places convincing (her first entry and mini dance scene). The film did not catch the width of the books, but I thought it was a good supplement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of this series, mainly because of Anne Rice's style, sensitivity, and treatments. And I found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
