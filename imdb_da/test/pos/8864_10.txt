This is another of those movies that I remember keeping up late to watch TV, scaring the crap out of myself in the annual age of 12 or so and then making myself a life of horror movie obsession. This is a great movie and is a living proof that there were realistic effects before CGI. Seen on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) turned off. The American researchers discover a decimated Norwegian base a few kilometers away. Everyone is dead, and only the semi-calcified remains of some unidentifiable things left behind to smear outside the connection can answer what has happened. The thing is brought back to the American base, and too late the scientists realize that it is alive and deadly. Thing thaws and is off, not only kills anyone and something that crosses its path but also absorbs them, makes it, and whatever, and whatever it wants. The film then becomes a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspected, everyone can be things, and no one trusts any more. Gone is the strength and security that exists when people bind together despite their differences in striking a monster. The group splinters and fears are supreme. Who's Thing? <br /> <br /> The gore effects here are absolutely fantastic and messily realistic. I could have done without the dog's head splitting like a banana peel, but it's just the wildlife in me that is fussy: Kill all the people you want, but let the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate quickly as the people are taken over by shapeshifting alien at all. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; The real threat lies inside and is frightening that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it is anger that is great, and the results are horrifying. <br /> <br /> This is one of the Carpenter's best movies, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All the actors provide strong and realistic performances, and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own protagonist. This movie has something for every lover of the horror genre. Do not miss it.
