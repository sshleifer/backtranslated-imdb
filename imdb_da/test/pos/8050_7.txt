While I score the movie a 7, I must also point out that it is both interesting historically (as is the stars Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less well-known) and have an exciting action for their day. <br /> <br /> The reason is strange for a Western, since all the problems with the Indians begin for the weird reason I've ever seen! The Indians decide to have a huge dog pounded (no, they don't feed dogs but feed on dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, no pooches are back! Then the two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White settlement steal and it actually touches an all-out war !!!! Not only is it stupid, but seems to play on the prejudice's audience. I don't know if American Indians actually ate dog, but it sounds like the kind of stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this over dogs! The movie has some excellent fighting scenes and exciting moments - like when Mrs Marsh crawls over the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting things! But, STRONG, too!
