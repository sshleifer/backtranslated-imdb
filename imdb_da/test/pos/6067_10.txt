I just watched the last episode, No. 32 (though the site says that only 30 episodes were made) and I have to comment that this series was really good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime / cop stories. Probably all 32 were based on facts with information at the end of each episode of the trials imposed on the criminals of the crimes, this has sometimes been a gritty, well-acted, credible, and dare I say entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to loosen the unit was almost incredible, as they did their job as well and in the series at least never failed to "get their man"! It's a certain 10/10 for me.
