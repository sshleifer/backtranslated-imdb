This one of the best and most fun comedy series I've ever seen! All signs are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very annoyed man, annoyed by everything and anyone. <br /> <br /> He'll do things and handle situations as well as possible, but he'll never get it right and only get deeper and deeper in trouble. Not supported by his wife Janet, who is only trying to get him deeper and deeper into the problem he is getting into (and really doesn't need the help at all!). All the characters are the game / portrayed brilliantly. Just imagine sending your child to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people don't like it (maybe some don't get the many many playing on words that exist many times per episode). <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that there is still no DVD release of it. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> Please, drop it, let it go! So fans can and will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you just like it! <br /> <br /> Just some names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Titch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many many more).
