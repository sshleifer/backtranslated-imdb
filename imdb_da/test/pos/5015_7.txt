This film was well acted and kept my interest in the main character of the whole movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu lived today! This film paints a picture of what Stu Unger's life might have felt. It was interesting to see how the connection grew. I would have liked to see more details about Stu's party, his game cabinet and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But all in all, this movie was well done, well acted, and the story touched on many aspects of a life filled with many events that were greater than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
