I saw Peter Watkins Culloden and The War Game a few months before this and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film, detailing, on the one hand, an attempt at dissidents in California in (apparently) near future, and on the other, the attempts of a group of convicted "criminals "to beat 50 miles of the desert to win their freedom in a state" penal park "as an alternative to the prison. Watkins films all in a documentary style, causing more than a little awkward or demanding strong suspension of disbelief: how is the camera crew with the group of starving and drawn prisoners within 2 days without offering help or sharing in their misery? And that's just the most obvious example. But questionable storytelling aside, pack this a punch; No doubt you should be interested in political filmmaking to really get involved, but the film is really not something else in its time: it does not pull, does not provide simple solutions. The left-wing political figures are, of course, painted widely at times, but they are not alike; The right-wing government officials seem a little more comic-like, but they themselves are allowed to show at least one little humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot of thought and leaves an indelible taste ..... 8/10 DVD rental
