I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The film had many different places in it. I really liked when Ann Hampton realized she couldn't make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann where together and Ann apologize for taking Rhett and Scarlett just told her not to worry, she would get him back. It had a great story, it told. You just can't compare it to GWTW. It only has so many wonderful scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course, don't forget to have a hankie handy.
