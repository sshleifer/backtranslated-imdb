Back in 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked the audience with his frank and opened the depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men. I've been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; LATTER DAYS are all that and more. Yes, it's soapy, melodramatic, clich√© and pretty corny. That's what makes it so wonderful. There's nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Regarding religion, people are sorry, but these things happen and happen to gay people themselves now. It is not only the Mormon Church who rejects their homosexual members. Homosexuals in any religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance based on the reality of the daily life of the characters. If I could give it more than ten stars I would. Good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
