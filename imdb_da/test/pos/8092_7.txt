This was Chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the results are mixed. The film is a bitter satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical lifestyle, especially with regard to the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and forward in 1940 and must have made many people crooked. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's earlier works, this is pretty pale in comparison. The black, funny style of his silence is, in my opinion, much better than his first talkie. There are lots of pointless bits that draw on. If this was a silent, it would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments to be the musical shaving and globe dancing. One of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the end. The great dictator is an effective and sometimes moving film that is a very large part of both Chaplin's history and film history. It's defective, but Chaplin is in good shape.
