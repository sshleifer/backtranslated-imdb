I loved this movie. Not because of the romantic stories between women, but for the visualization of human strength, despair and liberation. This movie is a must see. Entertaining! Emotional! Captivating! All the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and on some points, even the story. <br /> <br /> I have to say I recommend watching the movie first, so read the book. If you read the book first, you will be a little disappointed. The screen fitting cut a lot and some things were changed. Some for the better and some for the worst.
