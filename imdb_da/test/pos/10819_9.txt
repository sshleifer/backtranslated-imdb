First, a word of caution. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I don't think it was the intention of anyone associated with the movie, except for some marketing morons. While light and a bit of fun in places, it's NOT a comedy and if you expect you to be disappointed. I had never even heard of this movie and had absolutely no expectations in some way or other. Considering the two other DVDs I downloaded were great disappointments, I was so happy when I watched this movie. Action, writing and direction were excellent. The story interested me as you usually do not see movies about the last month in France before the Nazi takeover in 1940. It gave an insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to divide their beloved land. Along the way, there are plots that involve a selfish and weak actress who played very well by Isabelle Adjani - who looks wonderful after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a bad sap to take the fall. This juice escapes from prison and finds her - with another lover - a high official and creature played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a subplot is introduced about a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country, and eventually this becomes the main plot. The story has many beautiful twists, an easy sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some really exciting moments. Together they create a nice package that is safe to please.
