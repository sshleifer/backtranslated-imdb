This is not a life-changing movie; It is not an epic or something similar. But it's entertaining and it's fun. It's a movie that the whole family can see together, and at the moment there are precious few kids suitable movies that don't have a love story in them! It tells a good story in a noisy way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects that many movies these days are. It has some very good actors, and all the music that has been used fits well with the movie content. The action is also quite good, the actors look comfortable and trustworthy in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually fun. I would recommend it to people of all ages - it made me laugh. :)
