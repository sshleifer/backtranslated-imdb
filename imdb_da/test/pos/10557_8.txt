My Father Herten used to be my favorite movie when I was younger. It's about Andre, a divorced French man who wants to take her beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on vacation and hopes to get a little closer to her. But of course Nicole is not so easy to get along with, she just started puberty I she is angry and hurt her father never was there for her and decides to give him a hard time, Nicole enjoys a beautiful day at the beach, and she is a wild story about her and her father. and the movie becomes a fun, wildly entertaining movie, I would give my dad The Hero 8/10
