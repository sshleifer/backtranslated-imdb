This movie is a great movie, but like most movies, it is very predictable. The biggest highlight of the film is of course the star character Amanda Bynes, which is absolutely beautiful and fun. She is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strange and gut-busting faces ever made. It is good for the kids and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity at the end. All in all, they did a good job of updating an old classic and deserving to rest on the movie stand with O and 10 things I hate about you. The other actors also do a bulging job in many of their first-time debuts.
