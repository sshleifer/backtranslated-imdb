This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris, who spends a year in Barcelona. During this time, under the influence of all the new impressions, he changes and grows. When he returns, he has a much clearer picture of his life and finally takes it into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen and the reason is probably that I've been in a very similar situation. I am from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a very accurate portrayal of what an Erasmus holiday in Spain will do for you. From what I hear the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. Let me give some examples (mild SPOILER alert) - Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks like all the Erasmus shared apartments I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are nicely developed, and some fun scenes originate from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% correct. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. Ca. 90% of all relationships break during an Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - There is a wonderful scene where Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his flatmate from England, who is a little "uncool" to go out with all the others. Finally he succeeds, and Wendy probably has his life night. Another great thing about this movie is that it's really three linguistic: the students in the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so everyone can understand what is being said. I hope this movie will never be dubbed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for non-Erasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say: This is your movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
