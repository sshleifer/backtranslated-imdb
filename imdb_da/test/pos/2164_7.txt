Don't make me wrong, it was fun to see. It has a nice animation with the exception of a strange look and some good music. And the standout scene was certainly Elmer, Bugs and Daffy dancing on the floor, which was such a lovely and fun touch. In fact, the whole comic is nice to see, but all in all it's not what I call exceptional as Carrotblanca. There are some very fine gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would think of fun. And Daffy joins Elmer? Somehow, when he was a target for the hunter, it did not seem strange that he would be friends with him. Although I would admit it was nice to have daffy there. The voice effect was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All in all, unexceptional but very nice cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox
