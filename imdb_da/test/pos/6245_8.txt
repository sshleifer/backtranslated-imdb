"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller that came out in the 70s, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) who stumbled upon a cloesd down museum SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and eerie roadway museum. This gold memory of overdue but oddly life-like mannequins is led by the Slaus (Chuck Conners), an eccentric but seemingly innocent one. The Slaus has a warning for the young: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother. <br /> <br /> The kids' curiosity gets the best out of them and they are about to explore. The trap has jumped! In the midst of flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that suffocate on their own, authorized by a hidden force, the trap closes slowly into the group. "Creature" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins make friends and friends quick and brutal work until only one is left. <br /> <br /> Although not a Slasher movie "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of slasher movies such as chase scenes and stalking and the fact that the killer has a mask. The apparent telekinetic ability of the killer to lock bolts and animate wax dummies is used for great effect. Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is the mannequins that are scary enough to start with, but are rooky here. The movie succeeds in spite of, or perhaps because of a manifestly poor budget. These wax figures are blatant plastic shop dummies - but it can only serve as even more creepy when their eyes move with an incredible person. The play is actually pretty good, Chuck Conners gives a well rounded and eerie performance as Mr Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is great as the female leader.
