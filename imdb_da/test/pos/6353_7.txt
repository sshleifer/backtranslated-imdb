Hummmm, ... ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park !!! It seems that the number one spot for shooting was in the same park as so many of Chaplin's and Arbuckle's movies are set there! And even though this is yet another, it is different enough and well made that I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger than usual look and actor Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, although in the mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty doesn't share his feelings, and soon he and Mabel run away for something innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift ... and many problems result. Decent pacing and the fact that this movie doesn't rely too much on cheap slapstick, but a reasonable plot makes this a cute and fun little movie.
