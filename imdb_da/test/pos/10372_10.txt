After the funeral was absolutely fantastic, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with cards on the table that started so well, but dropped significantly in the last half hour, and I didn't know what to think of the roof after the flood, though I remember being confused at the end. After the funeral I have said is one of my favorite Poirot episodes, up there with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful in the book. Now I want to say that I do not mind changing books and do not try to compare movies and TV adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece, and the adaptation does not do justice. That's why I didn't like some of Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far out of the poirotte. The murder of Roger Ackroyd, taken to the flood and the cards on the table, are the only ones who really disappointed. Everything else varies from good to excellent, even the recent deal with death, despite the many deviations from the book that I admit is not a favorite, was surprisingly good thanks to the amazing production values, star ensemble performances and outstanding music scores. Back to After the Funeral, the production values ​​are amazing. It has a real cinematic feel to it, and the amazing photograph and amazing scenery and costumes made it a feast for the eyes. The music was very stirring and even joking, and the whole casting gives wonderful performances. David Suchet is impeccable as always as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as wonderful. But for me, the standard Monica Dolan as Mrs. Gilchrist, she is up there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best entertainment actor / actress in a Poirot episode, it was so good her performance was. All in all, one should see one of the best Poirot episodes far, and one of the more faithful too. 10/10 Bethany Cox
