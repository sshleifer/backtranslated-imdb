This is the classic western. The good, Glenn Ford, the dashing hero, the former soldier, the man who wouldn't hold a gun again. He will eventually stand up for the evil Earth Baron, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there is Barbara Stanwyck, the real rulers of the roost. Edward G. Robinson's wife, who will allow no one to get in the way, even makes Edward G. Robinson look weak. She is so vicious that all other bleaches beside her blind ambition and recklessness to control the valley and everyone in it. The sheen of her eye that she sees people face death for her is unpleasant. It's worth waiting for. Throw in a young Brian Keith and a few others and you have a drama that stands on its own. With the necessary stampedes, shoot-outs, ambushes and close-ups of hard-going cowboys, and you have a western heel. Without giving anything away, there are enough phrases in making this not just a standard cowboy shoot-em op.
