Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter plane - though F-14 is probably second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) do not measure acting and plot wisely, but the first - along with Top Gun - has excellent flight and music along with reasonable plot and play. II and III clearly have less of a "flight fee", but their biggest drawback is plot and action. I suspect that Iron Eagles relative fame and popularity compared to Top Gun is almost a reflection of Jason Gedrick's fame and popularity over Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is a far too short appearance of Shawnee Smith. 10.7
