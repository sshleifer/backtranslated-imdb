Hehehe. This was one of the best fun movie films ever! I laughed so I dropped out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody Banks and of course One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> It's about Norwegian crazy fans going to the World Cup in Germany in 2006. And all sorts of crazy fun that comes with it. It was fun. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun for years. Rumors say there will be a second, but I don't know. It will be hard to beat this one. <br /> <br /> recommended to everyone! It's a must see movie. I was supposed to see it at the cinema, but I had work at the times when it turned out. And have tried to rent it for a month, but always rented out. Got it today on DVD. It is worth it.
