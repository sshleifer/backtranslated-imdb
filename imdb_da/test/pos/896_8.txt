The first of the Italian rip-offs from the French soft porn blocks (although it may be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE with Erika Blanc) is a completely different water boiler than the twisted sequels from the late, doubtful great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer to the spirit of the now highly dated 1973 Just Jaeckin movie and takes a poker facade to male / female relationships and questions such hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings. Unlike D'Amato, director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini, who also made it hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE, actually a sexy up version of MADAME FUTURE!), We do not present to predators, snus creators or ravenous cannibals, do for quite a few shown less sensational yet much more erotic viewing experience. Photojournalist Mae Jordan aka 'Emanuelle' (lovely Java-born Laura Gemser in her first leading role after bit pieces as a Thai masseur in EMMANUELLE 2 and an "unspoiled native" in Just Jaeckin's part of the rarely seen COLLECTIONS PRIVEES) flying down to Nairobi where to shoot the stills that accompany an article by the famous British writer Anne, played by the very teutonic Karin Schubert with a slaughter hair who takes some getting used to. Anne shares an "open relationship" (remember when this was made) with his Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti), which means that both of them largely skip something with a pulse. Unlike her subsequent reputation, Emanuelle appears to be positively reticent to her heavy breaths, smuggling seductively to Gianni by prelude to the exquisite tantalizing pay-off. Okay, so she makes up for this lack of evil at the end when she makes a completely male hockey team on the train. I'm not asking you. <br /> <br /> The production of this sex exploit classic is quite impressive, especially the amazing filmography. And Nico Fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite for anyone with more than one passing interest in the genre, a hilarious Eurotrash pop-pop (try to make the very diverse texts and get a whole evening to be fun with the family!) That turns up in the whole movie in every imaginable type of reproduction from slow 'n' sexy to hip-gyrating disco. <br /> <br /> This is quite Laura Gemser's show though. Billed simply as 'Emanuelle' (which was another actress on the same director's elusive EMANUAL NERA 2) she shines the screen from start to finish. Not yet presented to infinite rape scenarios (as she would once be, D'Amato took over), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, a rare occasion that anyone who has seen some of the lady's work probably knows. A flawless Eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty (she comes from Dutch India now Indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan), she projects a little passive, even submissive sensuality, as on one or more Otherwise, her loosening from "aggravation" loosens her morally corrupt cohorts. Unlike the French movie, cheapskate moralization is kept to a minimum, almost thrown as an afterthought near the end of the movie, when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he has not lost her as he never had her at first. I swear you could hear the audience of the Just Jaeckin version when Alain Cuny's extremely annoying Mario appeared on the screen as it meant we were in for many minutes of halfback libertine philosophy as an alibi to get the divine Sylvia Kristel (now resident in the Belgian capital of Brussels by the way ...) to fight the real grounds theaters were packed for years at the end. Gemser's later husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, she married) appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk "Scottish" (huh?) Writer, who briefly strengthens Emanuelle in the middle of African ruins at some point, but no real sex scene though.
