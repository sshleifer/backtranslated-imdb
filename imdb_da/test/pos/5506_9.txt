many people have said that this movie was not a good movie, in a horror perspective I agree, it was not so scary, it had some cruel ways to torture yes (hooks go where they should not) but not scary. but it was a good movie on a comedic standpoint, i thought it was fun, so bad to act from the devil with his stupid theological question marks and every other word he said came out as "what is____, define______", then the evil mob in his house with one of them with a sign saying "we will not take it" (which is a song from his band twisted sister. But I think the part that made me laugh most was the one guy's wife who was dead and who cared her up and made her dance when i saw i broke into tears ... so i would not recommend this to avid horror lovers but to those who love horror for his comedy , I recommend this movie 100%
