Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) has equal hopes of being clean and finding a new life as a great band drummer. He is about to be released from a six-month medical rehabilitation program and has earned his time treating cards in illegal playing card games. But when he returns to his old neighborhood, criminalized in Chicago, he quickly finds pressure from those around him, including his wheelchair-run wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to return to the old money-making "Dealer" lifestyle that was first He started on the self-destructive pathway, which is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It is very rare for a movie to have as many beautiful character performances as this one does. Frank Sinatra is great as Frankie Machine, and realistically exhibits the symptoms of a drug addict who goes through withdrawal without a doubt better than anyone else had ever done before him. Sinatra seems to have a sharp understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant struggle for control over his own life, which is forever going on in the heart of that man, Frankie Machine. Parker as his curly wife Zosch would like Frankie forever, to make him "make money" to take care of her and pay her ever-increasing medical bills. She seems frightened by everything she sees as a threat to her control over him, such as the freedom a drummer can offer or something that can change the status quo between them. Onlooker Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have genuine, strong real feelings for Frankie, without wanting to control him but only to help him prove the best that Frankie has on the way to him in the world, if he can just hold long enough to wake up and realize it. Darren McGavin as heroin drug peddler Louie however is always just waiting in the wings by knowing just the right buttons to push, just the thing to say, to get a former abuser to return to the old habit, a profitable to Louie but fatal to the addict. <br /> <br /> Also, the setting seems to take on its own life, constantly dark, gritty, seedy, and criminal offense with nowhere near enough positive things to look forward to in life, a place where it's all To easily escape through a bottle or medication, a quick "fix" that really is not a solution, but only works to keep one in the dark away from daylight and all the bright prospects the world may have to offer. It's a nice touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the setting always looks brighter than when he is heading down the wrong road. While some argue that it is a little dated, it is for me a gravel movie with a realistic inner war within a man of control over his own destiny, one who has very strong character performances by all involved. On this basis, MANEN with GOLDEN ARM gets my highest possible recommendation.
