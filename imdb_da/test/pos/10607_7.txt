If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know they're longer than most movies because of the many song and dance routines (each one is over five minutes long). Fortunately, this has fewer song and dance routines and fits into "standard" movie length. Don't make me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but tend to fast forward through the song and dance section. I bought this DVD because I am a Ian Bohen fan. Although his role was not as big as I hoped, he still had a good amount of screen time. And his character was very different from his other roles. All in all it was a good movie. Like most Bollywood movies, there is at least one element of the controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy end has become of all.
