I don't usually go out of my way to see romantic comedy, and maybe I will in the future after seeing Return to Me. The reason was simple and no secret after publication. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where "chemistry" is bound and the good guys win, and you can just laugh and feel good. I love this movie .... and have the DVD in order!
