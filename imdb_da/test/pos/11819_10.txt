Way back in 1996, one of the airline pilots where I used to work gave me a copy of this movie. He told me it would make me cry. I never believed him, and we even made bets. After watching the movie .... I shouted a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself in the bathroom crying. It was actually the most touching movie I have ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother confronted Eric's mother, the line went something like ... "Your son's best friend died today ... and it won't be easy ... if you ever put your hands on him again ... I will kill you!" The last part where Dexter took Eric's shoes was a scene that never came to mind until today. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes tear. A story of what true friendship is about. My boyfriend loved it too ... She hated me to let her see the movie. I shouted a bucket, she cried a river.
