Being a fan of time stories was surprised that there was no 'unity' that sent Russell Johnson's character through time. He appeared just in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I enjoyed the reason for the dangers of 'changing' the future by changing the past. Other Twilight Zone episodes of time travel as "no time like the past", "Once Upon A Time", etc. Was more to my liking because of the use of time travel 'units'. Perhaps if Russell Johnson's character had been the same character he played in "Execution", it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself. As sci-fi fans know, no sign should ever ever die "in time driving episodes. Any kind of plot twists can be used in these types of stories. That was the only error I could comment on for this episode.
