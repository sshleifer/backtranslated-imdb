The name "Lucio Fulci" conveys images of graphic death and mutilation in perhaps the fans' thoughts. Thanks to films like "Zombi 2", "City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has a reputation for being one of the leading instructors in history. And although many of his later films certainly justify his reputation until the release of "Zombi 2" in the 1979 fulci's movie did not include anything near the amount of blood and intestine he knows, they were actually for it mostly gorefree instead rely on more traditional shocks and disturbing images for work. "Not a torture a duck" hardly contains anything, but still as his best. <br /> <br /> "Do not torture a duck" is set in a small Sicilian city where superstition rules instead of logic. The cities are very distrustful of outsiders as well as others who often throw them. After a number of child murders, though many people come down to the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), trying to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie. It is very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of Italian exploitation cinema. It also includes a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or Lucio Fulci. But the real drawing of "Don't Torture a Duck" is the disturbing nature of the movie. Small children, about twelve years old, appear to be in vain retarded people, visit prostitutes and are exposed to sex by an elderly woman. It also contains some very biting comments on the middle class and the Catholic Church. For reasons like this, "No Torture a Duck" was blacklisted across Europe when it was first released and never shown in the United States. Still, "Torture not a duck" stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as Lucio Fulc's best work. I really can't recommend this enough, check it out.
