Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the Charles Lindberg flight. He is structuring the movie through flashbacks extensively to tell the Lindberg story leading up to the famous Atlantic Ocean flight, which is currently taking place in the movie. Flying an airplane in the hour after the hour is not the excitement, and Wilder will not deviate from his theme as Lindberg as the hero of the common man, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well thrown and absolutely credible as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he must overcome to get his plane in the air must be watched. <br /> <br /> The movie comes through most successfully as Wilder weaves parts of the story in a way that creates excitement, then relief and then excitement again. The cinematography is quite good, the score by Franz Waxman improves the scenes, and Stewart really seems to make Lindberg come alive, you think he could be Lindberg. There are some of the 1950s religious schmaltz at the end, but overall, directional, acting and high-production values ​​surpass the predictability of the story (will anyone really see this image and NOT know that Lindberg did it over the Atlantic?) enjoyable movie that has been better than most movies from that time. Billy Wilder made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one representative of his craft-like best.
