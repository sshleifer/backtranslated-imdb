I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor Richard for that matter, so I have to go after how the film portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about its accuracy would be her brother Richard. But from what I saw and learned about Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness, and she was a very special person for me to grow up. I know I was not born until 1965, so I did not know her as much as some of you older fans, but I completely stopped listening to her music and I have good memories of her music. I can remember the song about "Radio" (every treasure, let everyone do ... so fine) etc. And I remember "We just started! In fact, I remember many, many of her songs and some people (a few) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her !!! (I'm not fun at this.) I also used to be anorexic in high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be precise and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to last 120 pounds in 1987. I developed some rather serious health problems from what helped me identify with the actor depicting Karen in the movie. The mother (Agnes) was very much like my mother in many ways and I could also noticing the pain Karen must have experienced because my mother was often uncomfortable, critical and disapproving when Agnes was (if it was right), the film was useful in identifying and getting to know Karen a more personal note not only to hear her music, but to see what she went through t is quite diffic ultimately depicting a person's entire life in 2-3 hours and telling every detail perfectly, so I have to say that there is probably no biography that is so accurate. I will give this story an 8 though! I wish I knew personally! I would have DIED to meet her !! I would have loved to shake her hand, give her a hug or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and she misses a lot.
