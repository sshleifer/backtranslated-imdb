For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a small lesson in American filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are heavily dependent on casting. You choose and choose characters you believe will enhance the movie's drama and entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Once you have shot lots of recordings, you splice together to make a movie with up and down, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have problems with existing recordings, you can either shoot some more that makes sense, find some stock footage or be wise with your story. The claim that filmmakers used pictures of sites that are not part of the film (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece, and the particular picture is one that resonates enough for to justify its non-truthful involvement. In any case, you use the recordings you can. So they did not happen to have police gun recordings for that neighborhood. Doesn't that include including it and just talking about it or maybe putting in some cartoon animations so the audience isn't "duped"? About no. <br /> <br /> As for the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, the Americans did. Yes, the Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end with a downward note? Just because it is put in a foreign country and foreign films largely on a down note? Let foreigners portray the bad prospects of life. <br /> <br /> Let us Americans believe there may be a happy end in the future. There can only be one.
