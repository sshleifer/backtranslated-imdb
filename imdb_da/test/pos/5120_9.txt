I only watched this movie because I didn't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater alone. Honestly, I went in and waited to enjoy a good nap - but found myself attracted to the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was on one of my all-time favorite TV shows many years ago, playing a mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was really sweet in this movie. The three main characters were all good young players. Also enjoyed watching and hearing Jimmy Buffet. The movie itself was pretty pretty - showing some of what makes Florida so good. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And to think I was disappointed that I couldn't take them to see "Stick It" - I think it was much better!
