I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and was raised to be a bigot. She even recognizes this. I don't think she really understood what happened, she had already realized that the child was guilty. Daunting. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their awkwardness. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work in this case. It was very fortunate for this family to have a person fit enough to look through the crap that was handed over to him. I could tell when a police lied. He didn't want to see the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person should be punished for the color of his skin. I read the book that the black man was being pulled behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. White does what they want with black. I'm sure the baby in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I would like to commend the director and the producer of this film. I feel that the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I'm an avid viewer of indy movies. I feel they are well-written and have substance. I am pleased that I am about to grab this film on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strong I feel about the movie and the prejudices that still exist in our modern society.
