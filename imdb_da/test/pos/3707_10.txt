This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I personally know most owners of the different places used in the movie. As a teenager, I worked in the fields around the isolated road, which appeared late in the movie with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are native to NC. I was lucky to see it on a local view. On the show was one of the people who helped select places and secure props such as. The bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus had no reverse gear and during the shooting the driver missed his stop point a few times and had to drive several miles to return to the right point. These details of the technical issues added to the enjoyment for me. The movie shows exactly life in this area in World War II. A well-finished movie and I am eagerly awaiting the DVD availability.
