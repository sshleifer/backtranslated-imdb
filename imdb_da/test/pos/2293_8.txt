You must have lived in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for over 2 years, and northern Honshu for 4. Believe it or not, what you see, paints a very good and accurate picture of contrasting east / west mentalities, both from a sports and personal relationship. A fun, fun and hearty movie that deserves better than Americans who see it can ever judge. 8+ out of 10!
