The show was fantastic and very professional. Madonna is a non-stop, dance and song for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jumping was a really good performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's a little hard to say which were the highlights because each song had something special and unique. I saw the living couple of her previous trips (Drowned world and reinvention tour) they were good but you can't compare to this one. The dancers were amazing, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you to see it. You will enjoy the show from the beginning to the end. Madonna is still the dance queen.
