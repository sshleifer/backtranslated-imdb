In a time of bad, if not horrible, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is, in my opinion, one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing has been so good since married to children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me feel like a comic genius. These guys really understand what's fun. I could see ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half of the laughs from seeing KOQ just once. Other fun people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I'm so glad they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show has been a hilarious winner at a time of most comic losers. Check it out if you don't have it !!
