I think it's amazing one of my favorite movies as a child and who said that songs were unforgettable they were mint I still remember them now WORD FOR WORD is the movie still a favorite with my family and my younger cousins ​​are now dependent on it Also they even know the songs this movie is great and an enjoyable movie for kids, it has a moral lesson, did not see it, it is not good because it shows how lies get you, nowhere with bad departure with a farewell comment: this movie is amazing love me xxx Ps i like the soundtrack, but i can't and yes the animation is good, the jokes are humorous, and the action never stops. This movie will go down into children's movie history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children.
