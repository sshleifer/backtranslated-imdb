If you are going to watch this movie, by no means go into this movie with the expectation that this movie will be fun because you will be let down. Yes, it is fun at times, but I would consider it a political thriller that is masked as a comedy. the performance is very good, especially by jeff goldblum as head of the election company. Although he has limited screen time, he makes a lasting impression. of course, robin williams is excellent.laura linney is very good for what a surprise. She is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood, and especially one scene shows this. This movie makes you think. What if a comedian jumped to the president and actually won? Would the country be better or would the country crush in a million pieces?
