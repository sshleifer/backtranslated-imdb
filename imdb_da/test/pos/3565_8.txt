George Hilton doesn't really touch me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but it's a great outing for him. Basically ripping off Django / man with no name and doing a wonderfully good job. This pearl opening series is a classic, and the cat n mouse game that follows is a pleasure to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
