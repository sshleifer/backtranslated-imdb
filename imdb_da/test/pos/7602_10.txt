I thought this movie was great, not just because of its history, but because it was portrayed much by the excellent cast. I read that Drew Barrymore was not unusual as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes she might, but in the film she played outside herself, who brought an ordinary girl to find out who she is in the world. The story is cute and certainly for the hopeless romanticists out there, I'm determined. David Arquette is sour as his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is beautiful as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her friend Aldys, one who was not afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit than being labeled as a "teeny boppy" flick
