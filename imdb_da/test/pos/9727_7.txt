Apparently a B-movie ... B must stand for Better plays and a better message than we get in big budget "A" pictures today. Modern films aimed at young women are certainly not designed to encourage the depth of character over low self-service behavior ... or increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not adhere to "feminine" standards. (On the contrary, criticism of the fake and flashy that this movie does, will not help sell more products that depend on girls * are not * satisfied with their natural characteristics or inner beauty.) <br /> <br /> Laraine Day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "borders" into rooms and confesses an inability to flirt. She ties in with Robert Cummings because of similar interests, a common sense of humor and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he will gradually appreciate over his superficial "charm" of his self-glamor-girl sister (who only brings its even selfish, ruthless playboy tendencies). Although Laraine is extremely beautiful, it is refreshing to see the inner beauty appreciated more and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most satisfying romantic relationship. I want young girls (and guys) to get this kind of down to earth message today. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Hollywood returns to make "B" movies again with modest budgets and is trying to be content with modest profits ... what do I say? To sacrifice to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like expecting a guy to give up the low sex pot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. It's crazy talk. <br /> <br /> Please find a time machine already! I belong in 1940. <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie higher, but the end is a little too abrupt and may lack enough indication of Robert Cummings' heart change. (I like the fact that B-movies are short and snappy, not bloated and self-indulgent, but this may need more than 70 minutes.) Also found it a little unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected of a sudden death in their family ... or be so forgiving to the one who caused it. I mean, I think it is * lovely *, but a little more grieving or bitterness would have been just natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice to make this family work noisy about their loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy and to make * we * forgive those involved in death - as it is just a plot unit anyway, not the right point in the movie. Strange.
