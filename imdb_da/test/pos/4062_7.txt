As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot is not exactly the star, the movie does not move, and it certainly will not guarantee any price (outside of Blockbusters' maybe) ... but then again who really cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro cease to produce a very fun, sometimes fun, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts well. Man, I hope in the future that my wife ages as well as Miss Renee have. <br /> <br /> Moving together, this "buddy" produces cop-flick loud laugh for a reasonable amount of time. The movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video / DVD publishing and instead go ahead and check it out. Eddie Murphy is in her usual top form and is quite happy to see. De Niro has shaped this type of role perfectly. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and think every real movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Best Performance: Murphy. Hysterical fun. Enough said. Direct Jobs: Nice. Nice action scenes, Murphy and De Niro used together as a charm, Russo fed in a good support job. My rating: 7 out of 10. It's not going to move you or anything ... but it's an extremely enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... was a great success.
