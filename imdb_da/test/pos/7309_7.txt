The movie begins with a dowdy housewife (Norma Shearer) finding out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had cheated on her. Three years passed and apparently they had been divorced during these years because of infidelity. During this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children when Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a wealthy community lady and she has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend - apparently to help Marie break up with a budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque ! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vamp and with her magic sex appeal, she can break up the romance - and no one seems to realize she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there at the weekend, and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways - and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are imprisoned by her. Neither does anyone tell them they were married, but it is obvious that she wants the new and improved Norma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the crowded - in some ways similar to Jean Renoir's playing rules. Strangely, despite the severity of the depression, such films about pretty rich people were pretty popular, but many today will undoubtedly find them a bit too droll in stains. But fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are lots of sweet and fun moments (especially at the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although it's not a good movie, it's definitely a good and more than just another time pass. My only real regret is that I didn't really love the end. You just have to see it for yourself - maybe you agree with the end, maybe you don't want to, but I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this clever movie.
