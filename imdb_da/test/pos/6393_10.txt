If you take the Huxtable parents and blend them with the Kyle parents, you get a perfect blend of over the top and underneath the parents that you can wish for your own family child rearing skills. The best thing about each show is that the parents do not come out as a pompous self-righteous upper class, know it all, but at the same time they are not the stereotypically under-educated parents who constantly become bamboo-insulated and disagree with their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; Almost the same ages as the Kyle kids, and I see so much of their situations reflecting my own experiences with my family. The dullness they pamper only shows that when you have love in your family, you don't have to take yourself seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your children.
