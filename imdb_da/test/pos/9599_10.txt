I'm not a footie fan in any way, but saw this with a friend as there was nothing else on the box at that time. (Thank God). Not only did we laugh from start to finish, but about a week later in the pub when we started discussing it, we made a real play of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. Is there the sloping pitch actually? I have released my email here, so if anyone hears about future availability or a repeat on telly, let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on TV !!! King Leek was also good !! another Tim Healy classic
