After the company coup in 1941, Max and Dave, Brothers Fleischer, were removed from their own Studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were responsible for the new operation, now renamed the Famous Studios by Paramount. Initially, the finished product from Famous was independent of Fleischer's latest production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing were expelled at all. <br /> <br /> Today, JAPOTEURS is one of the previously famous Studio SUPERMAN Shorts. <br /> <br /> Who had been the custom, SUPERMAN cartoon was a great combination of fine, appropriately fashioned music in the score. This applies to the theme (overture) as well as all multi-mood background (random) music. It was if each cartoon card had its own background music, as everyone was kept fresh by apparently recording it again with each picture. <br /> <br /> With regard to JAPOTEURS, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year of America's inclusion and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical, short-lived and direct evil. The dialogue and personality of the Serbian Japanese saboteurs were strict from the stockists in the ancient pulp magazine stories, where their every word was said in a sarcastic, utterly unwieldy courtesy, as the characters would flaunt their cold bloody as they made the most demonic of threats and violent acts towards the western world. JAPOTEURS is visually bright and uplifting, stunningly designed and uses some multi-level or tabletop animation to give its flying sequences a true depth. <BR /> <br /> Make good use of the bond between the animated cartoons, SUPERMAN Radio Show then heard over the Mutual Broadcasting Network; The comic has a close resemblance to the comic and uses the same talents of voters Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander from the Radio Show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with a *** Â½ stars. /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
