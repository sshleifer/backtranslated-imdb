Instead of seeing the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor" with nothing new to reveal except for a few real-life events involving a few individuals thrown in, the film's decision makers could say they contribute to the story's spread alongside anything other than CGI explosions fill in for a sappy romantic triangle. One should see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place during the historic era of World War II, which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of putting their weapons and giving in to the Nazis. It was part of the story that at least had to tell the outside world. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die comfortably as in Pearl Harbor, but through victims of true friendship. The movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with our hero not enjoying the honor of taking his country back, the return of love of his present lover, the return of love from his reunited lover or even the unconditional return of love by his life long Pet. He is completely heartbreaking and does not feel worse away in the Russian workplace. This type of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were their script. The film sometimes plays in the sentimental, but it also shows humanity's humanity. All in all, a worthy movie.
