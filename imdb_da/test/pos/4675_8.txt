I enjoyed this movie. More than expected. It has enough action, intrigue and places to make it worthwhile. Although I can't yet see Mark Wahlberg as the leader, he's been good enough to be a trustworthy manager, and that's ok. <br /> <br /> Superhero of the movie is Mini Cooper. It has been shown to have speed, dexterity and muscle to pull any job. And managing a maniac driver like Charlize Theron's character.
