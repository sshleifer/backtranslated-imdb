I haven't seen this movie since it came out on a drive in the theater and I've been searching for it since. At that time, I was 12, and the story excited me; and now the end ends me. It was young love that excited me most, not to mention John's vocals and the text of Taupin. The story (at that time) came home to my psyche. I'm a lover of sentimental movies and it's still in my head after 35 years - it's so good. Place yourself in the age of youth and let your fantasies run. If this movie didn't tense your curiosity, then you were just too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even in my age)! If nostalgia is in your locality, I'm sure this is an interesting movie to watch. It's innocence is simply amazing, and it's simplicity is so easy and comfortable.
