Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and their commitment to selling US secret government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce works for the government and his job is to guard these particular documents, which ultimately disillusion him about his country's conditions and practices. He then uses his drug dealer friend Daulton Lee, who has become a sought-after man, to be the curator of these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian embassy in Mexico and contacts Alex (Suchet) and they both start playing the espionage game. <br /> <br /> Lee is interested in pure money, while Boyce works out of anger at the system he is involved in. Alex thinks Lee is the inner man in the US government. Things begin to fade when Lee's drug abuse and reckless behavior in dealing with the courier position counteracts both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the original espionage game becomes more mortal and consequential for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without the cheesy action. The character motives and analysis of real issues are sympathetic but very well-written, and the film blends the real life events with underlying political themes of human predators. Where a larger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. Well directed and intense in parts, especially where the protagonists become immensely over the head of the spy game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn deliver incredibly great performances in a film that questions authority, yet there is no simple answer to the political message or complexity of this system. The protagonist's situation becomes the underlying message within "Falcon and Snowman", making it a smart political thriller with an exciting element of society, human relations and the American system. Great film! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 out of *****!
