Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been to! I love to see him !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I first saw him. I am eagerly awaiting everything and what to do. Hopefully, someday, I can see him personally. he is very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely fantastic !!!! In my opinion, he is the greatest actor I have ever seen! I loved him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls out there) and in "God created woman", "D-house", "Jason and the argonauts" and many more. I thought he was genius !!!!!! can't wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
