I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. After seeing some of the previous comments here, I believe, first of all, that I am not in favor of the death penalty. With that out of the way, I expect big things in this movie, but it just didn't quite deliver. Dead Man Walking is very clean, with good performances and a good script. In fact, it is difficult to fault it artistically. However, I felt that while trying to confront the questions of the death penalty, it seemed to be sidetracked by the religious / moral attitude (hardly surprising since the protagonist is a nun). Although I'm not a heartless individual, I don't really have any empathy with any of the characters in history. If you don't take religion seriously, you probably won't see much in this movie. I think Peter Medaks let him have it. It was a much more powerful and vibrant movie, and I would highly recommend anyone considering this to go and see it.
