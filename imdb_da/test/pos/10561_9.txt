After seeing Tipping the Velvet by Sarah's waters, I decided to see Fingersmith, the characters were just as good in both performances, though they missed Rachael Stirling in the adaptation of Fingersmith. <br /> <br /> The story was generally a good choice, the twisting and unraveling of the characters were amazing! Excellent watch only missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the romance of two girls, it's not one of the best movies to see. <br /> <br /> It takes another spin from Tipping The Velvet, but just as well. <br /> <br /> Would recommend it to anyone!
