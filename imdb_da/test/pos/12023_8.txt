Note: I have tried not to give away some important plot phrases (or the end), but if you are concerned about it, please think about watching the movie before you continue reading. Thanks! <br /> <br /> Of course, this was a rather high budget production, published by Paramount. The story follows the (supposedly true) exploitation of hi-man Jack Shepard in the 1700's London. He was a locksmith who was extorted in a crime scene by the damned "thief" to save his brother's life. After being double crossed by the thief, we become a kind of Robin Hood type figure and get support from the regular folk music. He continues to escape from several prisons (including the infamous Newgate) and have time to "entertain" several noble ladies. I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was a little predictable. The movie was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well finished and seemed realistic. I think Clavell captured London's lively atmosphere in the 1700s quite well, and I enjoyed his creative use of camera angles. And, unlike many films depicting this period, Clavell is not bothered to show us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in a scene, more people are fighting over a meat pie that has rolled through dirt on the street). <br /> <br /> All in all, I really enjoy this movie. I will admit that it lacks the wonderful nature and underlying political commentary that Clavell's next film The Last Valley has (a parable to the Vietnam War), but it still deserves a view or two. It is regrettable that it has never (at my knowledge) ever been released on video or DVD.
