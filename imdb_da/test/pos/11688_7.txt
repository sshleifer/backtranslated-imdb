If you liked this movie, be sure to check out others who are instructed by Work - you're out for a treat. Unfortunately, it's not his best, but still millions of times better than an average movie from the regular cinema. It explores relationships, especially the violent, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and good actors. Some plot inconsistencies, clich√©s and hollow moments destroy the overall effect. For the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: An interesting approach, but I can't see this movie becoming a Czech blockbuster. These folks are quite spoiled by their filmmakers {also check out things of Sverak, Gedeon}, and this puts a little behind.
