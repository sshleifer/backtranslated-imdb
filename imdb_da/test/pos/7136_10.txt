I would like to order this movie for women in treatment. I feel this is a good movie for them to see. I can't do it no where I've been to ebay and the other website to order this movie. now i ask you for help to find out where i can or this movie with or what to do to get one. I would love to show this movie. yes i was like this movie and many people here in treatment to see how people can change around and continue. I think Markie Post played it very well, she is a great actor, I love her movie. And if you have any other movie about addiction, I'd like to order them from the treatment center for women and men so that it can look at other people go through what they are going through in life.
