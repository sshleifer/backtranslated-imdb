"Sweeney Todd" is in my opinion one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story", it has a wonderful, intelligent score. It offers interesting roles to the two leaders and several supporting characters. It has a timeless theme, revenge. It has a lot of humor and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a simple wrong man in the industrial period in England. It shows people's inhumanity to man, how in Sweeney's own words: "There are two kinds of men. There is one who stays in his right place and one with his foot in the other's face." In an attempt to rectify the wrong that was done for him, Mr. Todd a plan to seek revenge. With the help of Mrs Lovett, who owns a meat shop under Mr.Todd's hair salon, they have chosen to have "the above, serve them downstairs". <br /> <br /> I was lucky to have seen the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I experienced the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler and several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects of this production are lacking, I say at least that this filmed production version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles and they have a wonderful time playing each other. <br /> <br /> Very supportive work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as the young lovers, have absolutely no chemistry and are essentially impossible. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
