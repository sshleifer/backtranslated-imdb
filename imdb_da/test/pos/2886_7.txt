This is a great concert that highlighted the best songs in the band 30 years of career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That said, I think the sound recording was bent on the mixing console and / or through the mixing process. However, this is not the boy's fault. They even mentioned that the show was setup last minute, so the band and their crew did of course their best. They should just not have put the exhibition to public consumption. Neils snare sounds distant, and Geddy's bass has a good harmonic content, but no bottom than in general !! They should have endured this concert and waited for a better apartment. Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Rushian. The quality is lacking in the audio department.
