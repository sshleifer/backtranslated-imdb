Alistair Simm's inspired depiction of Miss Fritton surpasses features. It is one of the great comedy characters in movies. It's just so wonderful that Joyce Grenfell is a character - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you have to curl up on the couch on a wet Sunday afternoon and be transported some time ago when scary, only appalling schoolgirls got our respect - not ours! I hear that a remake is in progress with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? He wants a hard work that competes with the champion - or should it be a mistress? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent it - it beats so much of what goes on today for comedy.
