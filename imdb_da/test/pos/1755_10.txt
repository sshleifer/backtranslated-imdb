I have seen this cartoon as a child, a father and now a grandfather. It's my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the big little tunes and the very good drawings. I absolutely love the most important song that comes up in the entire cartoon. I think it's a pretty little cartoon. All I have shown it simply loves it. It's too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing, it would have been a great success. I hope I can find a DVD of it because all VHS tapes do not do it justice. <br /> <br /> I think if anyone shows it to their child, they'll come up with the same result. They just want to love it. <br /> <br />
