This moody, scary horror girl begins at a castle on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean, a stunning setting as a vampire flutter enters and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). Bats change to a man known as Baron Latos, in fact Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks Dr. Edelmann's help to cure him of his vampireism. Finally, the good doctor also wants to help his haunted nurse assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's trickery pollutes the doctor's blood and he becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire himself. This is somewhat better than the previous year's "House of Frankenstein" which is less episodic and more exciting visually. There is a scary scene where Dracula tries to lure the other nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into her world, where she initially plays "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to scary music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to hit many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio often uses in their horror functions. Two artists are aware: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is initially sympathetic, so convincingly threatening. Adams, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. It all ends in a slam-bang climax, typically for the 1940s universal horror, a bit abrupt, with recordings borrowed from "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal releases it quickly on DVD (it was left out by their Double-Feature releases).
