Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern connect forces to clean up Geneva's average streets! Excitement as they put kibosh on international heroin smugglers, Polish refugees, looking toms, philandering girlfriends, renegade dogs and garbage bugs that are too lazy to recycle their bin. Don't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house girl. This movie is 100% action!
