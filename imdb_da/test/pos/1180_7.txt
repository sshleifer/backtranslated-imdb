While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it's better than most at all. I think it had a little laugh and just about a good feeling. It's not too often we get to see two old elephants, just have fun with their age and honestly have a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends / brother-in-law. Just seeing those who romanticized these women was fun, and you messed up them all the way because we have to admit it or not, for their age they still had games! : D I just loved the whole plot to be able to continue and have fun no matter how old you are. I would recommend this movie to a nice laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
