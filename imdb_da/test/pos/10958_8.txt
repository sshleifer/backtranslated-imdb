Seven months ago, an obvious view of Faces, I finally found a profitable DVD copy of Cassavetes' first feature. Shadows were shot in Manhattan and in his workshop on ad hoc sentences, and the shadows were the culmination of the months of the improvisation month, where (mostly amateur) actors developed bindings with each other, invented their characters, and polished their techniques to give their recorded performances is just the right tenor of spontaneous confidentiality. This intimate approach led to something incredibly bold work on faces, ie. Seymour Cassel hugs her hands on Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose, just as the actors' complete conviction here gives blinking honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital assessment of their relationship and Ben's disgust at a black woman's touch to express his racial confusion and self-suffering. A home-made, state-of-the-art production, sound and sound recording synchronization, and granular filmography and up-close camera setups create an immersive atmosphere that blends perfectly with Cassavete's nuanced view of human relationships as ever-ongoing works, characterized by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding. Charles Mingus's largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living at the moment, a mantra where Cassavetes worked and apparently lived.
