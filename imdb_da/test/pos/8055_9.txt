"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal, hard-hit docudrama about what was once called "the wicked city of America." The film documents the events that led to the murder of the Phenix City crime syndicate by Albert Patterson, a lawyer from Alabama who made a bid for the state's law office as a way to clear up the vice and corruption that plagued his hometown. His son, John Patterson, picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post, and made Phenix City become a primary item on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson created a movie that has the ability to shock even today. Grimness is so relentless that the film is actually hard to see. We see the crime syndicate beat and kill to get what they want - beating and killing includes women and children, and a scene in particular that deals with the death of a little black girl is particularly disturbing. It is not exactly an enjoyable movie, because there is very little payout eventually to reward the viewer for sitting through the disturbing events leading up to it, but it is a well-filmed movie full of intense and sour energy. <br /> A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with Phenix City's actual inhabitants, some of which are portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the movie. It gives the film a high speed that leads on to the story, so we feel we are constantly watching a documentary, a feeling helped by Karlson's choice to film in real places. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those movies that fills you with a sense of fair indignation and makes you feel helpless because you don't can do something about it. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
