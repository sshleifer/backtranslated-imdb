Not really sure what to do about this movie. very strange, very artistic. not the kind of movie you see because it has a compelling plot or character. More like the kind of movies you can't stop watching because of the terribly fascinating things that happen on the screen. Although the first time my wife saw this, she couldn't do it all the way ... for disrupting her. Runs a bit long, but nonetheless a worthy display for those interested in very dark movies.
