This movie stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally clever guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is in a terrible fire, and his face is terribly burnt. Because he looks so horrible, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he goes to a crime scene to make money to buy a mask to hide his uglyness. Just how exactly the movie goes from there, just look at yourself. <br /> <br /> I scored this movie an 8 because it's a good movie with the money used to do it. a lot of good phrases in the plot to keep it interesting. The movie could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime movie, but it goes far beyond this and it gives some real surprises. In addition, the excellent play by Lorre shows that he was able to support more than just roles. This is an excellent movie and delivers more than most "A-pictures" of the day.
