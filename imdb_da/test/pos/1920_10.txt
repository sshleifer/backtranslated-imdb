Filmmakers made a rather boring general story, looking interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back home. At the same time, we are exposed to a genuine original existing French wage. <br /> <br /> The movie is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I have experienced something that is accidentally profound, making it more profound. <br /> <br /> Film has visually interesting interior elements. Totally loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Very many Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this to reach a wider audience in the United States.
