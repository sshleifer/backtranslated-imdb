`Manna From Heaven 'is a wonderful convincing film. <br /> <br /> Within the changing paradox of values ​​in middle-class Americans from 40 years ago to today, the plot adjusts concerns and hopes for an interesting range of `Damon Runyonesque 'characters. <br /> <br /> Their struggle with moral dilemmas that pervade 'what could have been' hopes to fulfill youthful dreams, romantic longings and 'beat the big' together to make a most entertaining movie. Instead of relying on sexual existence, the burgeoning relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle, but clear. His untying knot in her shoes at the Art Gallery and their warmth in their poker games is outstanding. The writing of the script is interpreted skillfully by an excellent star and supporting cast. One of the few films I ever want to see twice in the opening, `Manna From Heaven 'guarantees absolute national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
