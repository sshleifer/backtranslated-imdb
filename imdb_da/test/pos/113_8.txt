This was a bold movie to beat Indian cinemas as it was released. The first film may openly depict lesbian tendencies among Indian women. The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added the material to the film with her warm passionate scenes with Nandita Das. The film was exterminated with sexuality, and the director used sex in the best possible way. The sex was not for erotic purposes, but was in connection with the film. The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband was certainly the first of its kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> Good acting by all the actors, especially Nandita Das, opposed to criticism from the Indian public
