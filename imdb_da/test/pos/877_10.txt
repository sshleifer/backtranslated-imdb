This film was marketed extremely well. When it was released in '97, everything and everything with his name sold it in the middle of Master P's fame and success from the shelves. Therefore, it is no wonder that this underground city drama sold over 250,000 copies and still goes. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of No Limit again or even now check it out. It has a couple of old schoolfat videos and doesn't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers on the bonus Ice Cream Party. So what I got to say to all the people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records doesn't look at it because it's not for you and doesn't bother voting for it because you will only discourage TRU no limiting fans from renting or buying this video with your low voices.
