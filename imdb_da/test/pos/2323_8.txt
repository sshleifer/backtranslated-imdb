I watched the movie in the theater at the release, watched VHS tape over the years, and while I was walking through Target saw this DVD bundle of "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There is something about this comedy that has really clicked on me - how Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel part and a herd with scrubs and misfits. He's up against Navy's Best - a Los Angeles Class Nuclear Attack Sub - and his old captain (WM Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the bad guy, Rip The Tower Admiral runs the exercise - If you don't laugh hysterically during the "run quiet" segment with the chef, yes, you have another kind of humor from me. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the machine operator "DBF" says without explanation - apparently something within the knowledge of an old underwater consultant - thanks to Google, I learned that with the rise of ancient atoms, the ancient salts would carry "DBF "pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A marine friend said that many technical aspects are not correct, but who cares - it's one of the funniest movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I don't think it requires a clairvoyant to know who wins in this exercise!
