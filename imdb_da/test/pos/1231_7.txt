Travis (James Franco) is a young man driving on trains for business reasons (we assume) leaving his beloved phone. It is picked up by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to his city to pick it up, there are a number of events that will surely stay with him. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers they have set up to defend themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it is obvious that both are eager to knock them down. In all, there are about 30 or so spoken lines, but from the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you might as well turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. One scene to watch out for is that Terri stares at herself in the mirror. You can just feel her despair through space. <br /> <br /> But the movie isn't perfect. It is mostly recorded using handheld cameras, which becomes a little distracting. Mainly due to the appearance of Mr. Franco and Miner and the photographing do not differ so much from the script. Nevertheless, it seems that history doesn't really know where it will go. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of movie that really stays with you long after you've seen it. One hour after you see it, you're still 'what-if' yourself on behalf of certain characters. It's not flawless, but lets you more and more want it to be at least 4 times longer.
