What excellent movie made it even more because my wife and I stumbled upon it so seriously as to surf the canal on a lovely frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best performing a cast of very normal and human costar characters through one of the most wonderful feeling good movies we have ever seen. Why this movie didn't get the attention it deserved on its release in 2002 is hard to understand. Why it was head and shoulders over so many of the dull pieces of garbage that were released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in display. Obviously, as the public, we are forced to feel what has been considered "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential, while true gems like "unconditional love" are able to shine through all the pretending to truly fun cinema . Rent or buy this movie ..... you won't regret it!
