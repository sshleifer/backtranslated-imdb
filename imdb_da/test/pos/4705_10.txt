I got a chance to talk to co-creator, Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY. She said her style is to be completely open and unobstructed in film making, but was very happy to be so severely restricted in the group's seat. The narrow hallways and small rooms were professionally shot with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character, coming from tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring, hard and street smart. The way the film introduces us to her past is excellent, and uses only a few carefully selected minutes anywhere. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't start praising this movie properly. It is really a treasure of cinema and the subject is a treasure of humanity.
