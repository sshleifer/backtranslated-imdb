I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA I was for a treat! <br /> <br /> For anyone who, like myself, was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it's time to rejoice because the wait is finally finished. Writing, performing, filming and controlling - all in top. I hate to admit it, but I actually cried at some point (when Dracula spoke to the curly guy). Really an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The ship's corridors provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale, and the actors could really make their fears come alive to me. And Coolio like a vampire .... very nice! <br /> <br /> Believe me .... as big as most of the movie was ... the end will blow you away! I know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason, but I don't know you saw the end coming. Brilliant!
