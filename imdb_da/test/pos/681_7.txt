Intense domestic excitement with the house mistress (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (Ryan). The two masters of the genre are at their infamous, erotic best, as they match wits, feelings and will in a bizarre hostage situation right out of Saturday night entry. Really hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-ups of headshots. The young girl who teases Ryan is really well headed here. Inappropriate, but satisfying suburban melodrama.
