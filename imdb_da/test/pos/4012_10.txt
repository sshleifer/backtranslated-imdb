This is probably my favorite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! I always make myself laugh and feel good when I see this show. There is just something about what is great, hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Some or all of the episodes are synced with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The sections start again when they end - but DO NOT play end credits at the end, but always play the opening credits. With most episodes, the album plays once and the episodes are played twice, but some move on.) <<Br /> <br /> RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double bogey' Kid A / OK Computer (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Of Love 2.19 'World without Alex 'Kid A / Wish You Were Here / Pablo Honey (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are traces in the episodes that tell which albums are being synchronized. Kid A can sync with every episode!
