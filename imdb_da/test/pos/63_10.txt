It's really a good movie (after being able to ignore Blake Edward's Pink Panther references, which he seems to be obsessed with and is very unfunny). Julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in Haymarket, London at the release. But Julie's non-look at the British premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shoots of Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial photographs, but she didn't. Two box office flops in a row ruined his film career for a few years. But Darling Lili, like STAR !, deserves much more public recognition.
