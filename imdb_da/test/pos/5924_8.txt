1st seen 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular rendition of Lindbergh's famous flight of James Stewart as Lindbergh and director Billy Wilder. There isn't really a lot of background built into this story, but it's OK because Wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective when he used his book as the basis for the movie. This early flight film should also be one of the best about the action itself. Stewart speaks and thinks of himself during the flight giving you so much insight into what Lindbergh went through in this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole plane without sleeping the night before - which is great !! There's a little backstory about how he bought the plane and got the funding, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the movie is mostly about the flight. The story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to see despite its age. I appreciate the fact that they did not throw much fluff and just let the story tell themselves. Well done all the way through. This is a classic movie that should be seen by everyone.
