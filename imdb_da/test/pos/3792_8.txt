In these modern times (as a subject that knows quite well to the director of the short film this German counter should speak of?), Politically correct film is the "search motive" of the modern young filmmakers' projects. "Shoulder Arms" directed by Mr Charlie Chaplin during WWI (the film was released just a few weeks before the ceasefire) is a clear example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very daring people, surely! To lead a humorous movie inspired by the horrible, bloody First World War was a complicated matter that few leaders with the dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do? To venture into such a delicate business and successfully reserved only for geniuses. As this German counter said "Shoulder Arms" was made during WWI, then in how surely the whole world lost its innocence (fortunately not the German fat heirs of this aristocrat?) And it is a hilarious, inventive social satire about it and every war . The movie it is full of great gags and entertaining movies continuity to a story in which the tramp will live however risky and brave adventures in the front? About a hero for the Allies ?? or not. <br /> <br /> To mock the war grave, the insecurity, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how do you dare !! ... by the way, there are many inaccuracies in the movie the German soldiers had at that time had mustache and longer beard for not to mention that Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform?) in an elegant, fun and delicate way, it is yet another movie miracle impossible to be surpassed. Given the terrible military circumstances, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. It was clear that Mr Charlie Chaplin had much of it. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to take my vacation temporarily because this German Count has to go back to the Schlossgrave. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
