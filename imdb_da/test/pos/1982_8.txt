eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I wondered what was happening, organic "pods" made of mutant reptiles that linked you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via an umbilical cord, it seems a little. <br /> <br /> But when it comes, it's a great movie with a couple of twists with a big open end, and the good aspect of weridness throughout the movie is entertaining too, since you're not sure what coming next time. br /> security personnel throw metal detectors; they have bone cannons!
