It's really pretty simple. The film's name is the death bed, the bed that eats. If you are something like me, you already know if you want this movie. I stumbled across this gem at Best Buy the other day and picked it up for Ten Bucks. I have ten bucks worth enjoying out of the title and box alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B movies. This, in my opinion, is one of the biggest B movies I've ever seen. Now it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's not even for most people. In fact, I think they will only be a handful of us who really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like B movies, this movie is a diamond in rough. It has a good premise, a bed ... that eats people. It is not possible, it does not move, it does not have a siren call to attract people. It largely depends on people walking around and sitting on it. <br /> <br /> I loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the small weeks I've owned it. <br /> As I said, after reading the movie title, you already know if you like it. If you laugh or smile, give it a ride. it is worth it.
