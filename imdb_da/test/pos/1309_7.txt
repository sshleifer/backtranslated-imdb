I have just seen this with my three children - 12 years (boy), 10 years (boy) and 8 years (girl) and this film was good old-fashioned family action adventure. Although it was clearly aimed at the children's market (I would say 5 to 13) it was probably tough, and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a wide range of ages while still suitable for the whole family to see - especially younger children. The story is about Ricky, a bit of a geek with a living imagination (this can certainly be seen in his daydreaming sequences) that comes with a kidnapping and greater art theft at the same time - on a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is a flight mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the aircraft's interior interior, but is also a top gun on his computer's flight simulator. This is convenient when the pilot and the co-pilot are cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane. I will not give away more of the plot.
