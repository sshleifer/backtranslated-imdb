Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever ... dry and droll like Sam Marlowe. The music of award-winning composer George Duning (from Here To Eternity, Picnic, Suzie Wong World), the film scene of perfect places [including the famous ambassador hotel] is quite right on target as famous television director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most welcoming group of well-known character actors through a spear of any dark detective film made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor ... this is a hoot.
