A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some amazing moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Even though it takes a long time, its focus loses altogether, there are enough fun moments that will keep a curious viewer going until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; You will recognize so many great, little-known artists throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), even though the baby from a Christmas story turns out to be in a small part. Rent if from Netflix, if you read this, I know you will enjoy it.
