I didn't read the book "Scarlett" and when I saw this mini-series, I enjoyed it a lot and thought it didn't have to be compared to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares about a movie. Even in the credits it is based on the book, it is not the book. The film is clearly overlooked by the reviews that other people write, but can't even spell the protagonist's names correctly. <br /> <br /> The actress in Scarlett thought I was amazing. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them the touch. As far as other people go, they compare them to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Of course, they did amazingly, but the leaders of this movie are completely different people who have their own behaviors and should not be pushed for what people should say. If you wanted some actors to do, then you should have directed the movie, I am sure other actors would not do the same with the chemistry and wisdom they brought to these roles. The support noise stood out with that grandness, and Jean Smart steals scenes that shave in with his comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The location in the movie was very beautiful and it was just amazing to see Scarlett go to all the places in the movie as she creates problems and other things. Also, the scene where Scarlett speaks to her father's grave was very dramatic, and I thought there were two great actresses that brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not just Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The movie and the book may vary, but you must not remember that this is a sequel to one of the best movies ever made or you will believe that it must be like Gone With the Wind, And you won't like this movie. But this is an under rated classic that is unlike GWTW, it's its own movie. Also remember that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
