Yes, I give it a 10, because I am not only comparing it with others of that kind, but also for the boy you are bombarded with every day in what is called the laughter of today's "folk culture". On the other hand, the film is beautifully cast, as it has been said elsewhere, and gives us a pretty good look at popular theater in the late 18th and early 20th centuries. No less coincidence is that many of the games played by Olcott involved a similar plot: boy meet girl, any objects (usually father or any authority figure) boy fight, boy win girl. It was actually known at the time as a "Chauncey Olcott Act". Not by chance John Ford ruled one. He called it "the quiet man". And "My Wild Irish Rose" is in itself a "Chauncey Olcott action". Good things, no? Anyway, good songs, good things. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie I would like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit that said he stopped with the "Mauvorne" due to insanity (replaced as in the movie, by Chauncey Olcott) and died in an asylum several years later. But he himself had been a very big star in himself, who wrote songs and plays and had plays written to him. <br /> <br /> Anyone know more?
