Another period for Chen Kiage ... (can't remember him making a modern movie!) ... Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of the HK fighting scenes or the Hollywood type of heroes, but that's good because of it. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br/> <br /> Understanding Mandarin definitely gives the English subtitles the edge. The movie is 3 hours, but it doesn't feel like it.
