Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the common man, mistakenly accused, on the run (sometimes really driving, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation outside his control, the first being "The 39 Steps" that really did him popular in the UK. It's really his signature theme. Others are "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "To Catch a Thief", "The Wrong Man", "North by Northwest ", and finally" Frenzy ". "Saboteur" starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a war-time war worker, accused of killing his colleague and best friend during a sabotage action on the plant. He meets with model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane during the race from the law and later of course the various Nazi / fascist sympathizers along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", even with similar plot devices like handcuffs, the blonde who doesn't trust the protagonist in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland and the other California to New York) and meet the "colorful" locals along the way. And so, like "The Man Who Went Too Much", I think this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's previous works. I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American, kind of an "everyman" with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on a Train". As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle; his lines are good. There are some fun strokes all the way for some comic relief, such as road signs with Priscilla Lane character on them, and circus sideshow performers and truck driver Murray Alps. Contrary to other opinions, there are not too many characters who believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, first and foremost when the action first moves to New York, but it gets fast when it's the last scheduled action of the fifth colonists. It's one of my favorite movies from Hitchcock (I put it in my top 5), especially these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home. <br /> <br /> It makes you think, "Can my colleague be involved in something evil?" In fact, one of the movie posters proclaimed "Saboteur" "Watch Out for the Man behind your back!" Imagine how it played in adult minds during World War II.
