This off-beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews. My question is; Why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did very well for her first (and only) time management. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This movie seems to have a prospect for the future. Although it came out again in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet predators appear to be the underlying plot here. Although taken to a different level, it is a problem that we are still facing today. I admit the story fell a few times, but it doesn't make it a bad movie at all. Robert Englund is even in this movie that automatically does it better. The action was not bad, the characters were also pretty good. Hendriks was a pretty good antagonist, I think. I give this off-beat horror a 7/10. Recommend to Saw fans.
