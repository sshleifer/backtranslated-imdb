In my personal opinion - "Patriot" is one of the best Steven Seagal movies. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst ever, it's not like SS, etc. I disagree. As a very spiritual person, a great master Seagal established a good tradition in action films. He always has a good background, good action, high professionalism and a smart message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes, amazing aikido. Although not much of it, it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his film production shows only his spiritual growth (he does not kill Chisolm's mate). <br /> <br /> "Patriot" is definitely one of the best movies from the "filmmakers" point see what I've seen lately. You have fantastic panoramic views from Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (including - horses and flowers). The sound track also deserves a few words. During the film, I had a great opportunity to listen to classic American-cowboy-western music (not Country itself). Similar music was heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". SS's plays have greatly improved since his last film. His role is unknown to him (as opposed to cops & commandos), but he does a good job of playing the retired doctor-from-government. His action is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was really happy with the cast. LQ Jones shows that life and death come together, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist, Camilla Belle looks good as McClaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr.Seagal is discussing the highly debated "Real American" tradition and the military corpses give their own point of view (he likes the Constitution just fine, but lumpy bearded men have nothing to do with it). Also good points have been raised with regard to the East-Western medical system and nature. <br /> <br /> Seagal is the best. And opens new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
