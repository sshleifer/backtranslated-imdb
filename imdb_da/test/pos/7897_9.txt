Caution-possible spoilers in front ?? .. Just looked 'Joe' for the second time. The first time was 30+ years ago on an air force base. I was reminded of the Air Force overcoat by Tech. Sgt. stripes bar of boyfriend / dealer; We flyers had a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because it is a 'lifer' rank. Over the years, I have carried several other pictures from the film. First was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you could not take her eyes off her. I didn't understand until now that this was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss she did not do more movies when she looked out of it. I also remember the irony of having a counter-culture hero that Peter Boyle plays the role of a right gun nut. Not unlike George C. Scott, generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And of course, the shocking end made a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> 30+ years ago, it was the most talked about movie ever played on the base. We thought it was a good movie and I have been reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be as disappointingly dated as Easy Rider. But when I saw it today, I was surprised at how well the movie has stopped. It is a very powerful script with few holes, although you should be surprised that the boyfriend immediately comes out of the bath when Sarandon comes in with him. Searching for an explanation of why this movie is still so entertaining I have to believe it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically credible as Joe (as others have pointed out that his depiction would inspire Archie Bunker's character a few years later). Has Ted Knight modeled his 'Caddyshack' character Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertising consultant in 'Joe'? They are similar and similar. Patrick was completely credible as the wrapped-for-tight upper middle class executive. And Sarando's talented innocent with the Raggety Ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers - perfect casting. <br /> <br /> The naked and drug scenes actually stop (they were very provocative for their day) and are as explicit as something found in 'Thirteen'. The only thing that dates this movie is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was at the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the tone of the film violence was just beginning to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason why this movie stops is that events over the past few years have brought the relevance of the theme and the context of this movie. In the film, both types of "conservatives" are portrayed as full of fear and hate against the unconventional ways of counterculture; and full of envy on their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is portrayed as mocking the equal culture; And although it was paranoid to conservatives (legally so it was only a few months after the Kent state), they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to counteract. The political landscape is not so different 30 + years later. I'm not sure conservatives envy young and liberal as much as 1970, but they fear and hate them more. An excellent movie that is surprisingly as relevant now as in the early 1970s.
