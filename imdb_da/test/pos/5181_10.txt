I just watched the movie tonight and I found it brilliant. It has no special effects that blow you, and it is not violent or bloody, no terrorist or alien, but it is brilliant. It is simply lovely, sweet and it brought me to a completely different time, a much simpler time when people could take the time to walk down the street and look out at the sea. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it to one. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone should look at this, mostly when they feel down, or when they want to share something good with their friends.
