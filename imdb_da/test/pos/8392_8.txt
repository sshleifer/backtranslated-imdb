Not your daily Tom and Jerry for many reasons. One who is a voiceover tale of Jerry, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, the two are friends who were also rare and rarely work as well as the more conflicting shorts do. Third, and most importantly, the comic is rarely humorous (by design), and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a blood bubble at the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton. Not quite successful, but it works to a great extent. The hardest ends for an MGM card that I can remember. Not for everyone and evidence that these shorts were never intended exclusively for children as a target audience. Worth to see. Recommended with the reservations above.
