I actually caught an ad for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year and wondered what it was before I saw the trailer for the movie. It was when I remembered that I had seen the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel some years back. I got it and it was quite good, as well as chilling realistic. That's enough to get the reader to hear any news about earthquakes in Japan. Now I have read the book and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was quite good, though there are big changes from novel to movie (but that's understandable). The story is simple - a great tectonic shift will make Japan sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis rock the country, as frightening efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. A scientist has a plan that can stop the country's vision and save what's left of the land mass, but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS in Otakon 2007, and while there were a few issues I had with it - it runs a little too long and a couple of character moments were a little too sappy - I was blown away anyway. The sheer concept of a whole nation sinking into the sea was made scary, and the effects were some of the best I've ever seen, rivaling something that Hollywood has done. The movie also does not play favorites with the protagonists, while some do not make it to the final credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I've been surprised by some of the negative comments about this movie. Difference in opinions, I think. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I have read the original book.
