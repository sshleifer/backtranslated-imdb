"Blind Spot" one of my festival favorites. I was absolutely fascinated by the idea of ​​three strangers seeking a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is good. James Franco is especially amazing as the broken boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over narrative, work well with the pictures and are quite intense. The film has a strong style. It pushes elements such as the road movie and revenge drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening atmosphere of lost love. There is a dreamy quality for multiple sequences, and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of excitement. Strange. Tension filled. Beautiful to look at. Definitely worth a look. I really want to see it again. I check regularly to see if Blind Spot has been distributed. I can't wait to watch the movie again in the cinema or on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
