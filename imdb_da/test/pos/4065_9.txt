"Showtime" is a fun movie starring Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, a Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: At the start of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective enters a television store trying to bust some criminals. When the police arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy) tries a police officer to arrest Mitch without knowing he is a policeman. During this scene, there are lots of fun things that make the eyes of the television producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a TV show called "Showtime" featuring the starring Tray (Police) and Mitch (Detective). But that's just the fun part. The rest is strictly excitement and action. There is a foreign man who sells and makes very dangerous weapons. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in reality, DeNiro and Murphy have a whole adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a seven or 8.
