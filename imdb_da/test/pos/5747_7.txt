This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers almost everything in your face. I am a Christian and liked the movie in a way. It had some average actions from the main character and it was a low budget that you can clearly see. It may be a bit lengthy, but the movie has some pretty fine cars that save it from a lower rating from me. As a Christian movie, it was pretty good, but maybe a little right in the message. The movie works best on a large screen. * SPOILERS * The battle situation with the two brothers can recall the battle situation between the two brothers in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" with Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give it a 7/10.
