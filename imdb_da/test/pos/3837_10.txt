I really enjoyed this movie and I usually don't like animated pictures. But I thought the cats were appealing and the story was charming. There is a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat", it's very fun. It has some comical moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat loves to enjoy this movie.
