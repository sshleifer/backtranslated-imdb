Horses on Mars is an engaging animated card that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those who are not yet evolving. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narrative involving the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate enough to see this map in widescreen format at the Sundance Film Festival 2002, and suppose that when transferred to the small screen, it will lose its ability to draw the reader into the less meticulous story and amazing graphics .
