I'm surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolists in the movie ..... that's what made the movie an incredible work of art! The story deals with some of the worst content that a movie could hold, but it is one of the best movies I've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and shine in history. <br /> <br /> If you want to be aware, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the couple. The older brother made the story that the cart flies as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who would argue why he would lie to his own children with the story. For me, the answer is because he will not share such cruelty with his own children or that he has blocked it and replaced his memory of the horrible event with the idea of ​​his brother flying away for safety. I have read some of the reviews that believe he was a single child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination that is used to come up with it. I don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. But I find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death. However, I like the idea of ​​ending much better than the idea that the film had no symbolism at all. There are many different features you can have on the movie, but if you take the film on par ..... two brothers create a wagon that flies to escape a violent stepfather - you've missed the brilliance. The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script was what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ...... dig deep when you see it. You will be amazed at the genius contained in the movie. The only other movie I've seen so close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ..... but it's a comment to another movie!
