Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year olds was a risk I admit. But it is worth it. They were enchanted from credit to credit with their parents next to them. <br /> <br /> I've been taking the kids to movies with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. However, with this movie I was happy to see a smart movie with humor, style and a sense of passion coming from the screen. Any movie that takes 5 (!) Years of production to do, good or bad, deserves some respect for the bravery and patience it takes to film a movie like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I slip a little. So again, why wouldn't I be excited? Looking through the movie list today reminded me only of the poor quality of movies being distributed. At least for the moment Whether or not, W & G is a movie well made. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, yet well-told and well-paced. Too much adult humor? Too many gender references? Maybe. Although my kids didn't catch them altogether. Too young. So in my case I didn't really notice. <br /> <br /> Well, I liked it.
