One night rescuer Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his black girlfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel to his home. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the security at Mc Cool's. Suddenly a shot - Utah is dead. So ... ... I'd rather stop here to tell the plot. It's like explaining the story of "wild things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and his last work - he died in July last year ...) was told by 3 perspectives - the 3 men who fall to Jewel . All of them see her from different eyes - like John Goodman as a detective who falls in love with her because of being remembered by her dead wife ... No wonder the boys fall for her! Liv Tyler - she's a real jewel. She made the big screen shiny! She played her role as if she were in a 40's noir thriller. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cool vamp that goes over dead body and uses the men for her needs. And of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, Bingo player killer - he was pretty cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was a little too much slapstick for my taste - the weakened atmosphere. That part began when Paul Reiser (as Randy's cousin Carl) put on his leather dress for Jewel. The "YMCA" season doesn't fit that much here ... ... but completely, "One Night at Mc Cool's" is a beautiful COOL movie noir parody! <br /> <br />
