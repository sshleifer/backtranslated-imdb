This is my favorite movie, and I think it's perfect. Unlike virtually any other movie I can mention, I never see this movie and think it would have been better if they had changed this or that or anything. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think. Every brush stroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from Schrader's script. I have always resembled Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with taxi driver and Light Sleeper is a great movie), but although his writing often seems to hit the limit of bombastic, his style of government is usually non-existent. This is deliberate, I think, because his film is usually about a search for redemption and is set in the real world; ugly and hard. His style fits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the audience the truth about the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead instead of Scorsese. But as the protagonists of the two films, while Mishima was the man, the Schrader ideal was material, right, in vain and unlike society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, he had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer who exclaimed what could reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. So you would not necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture the subtlety and beauty of movies. I think the movie shows he was. The script, he helped divide, split the Mishima man into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. His death, which he will always be best remembered for, is handheld documentary style. And his mind is represented by the dramatized excerpts from his novels, all of which revealed the thought processes of this complex human being that almost never wrote a sign that was not a reflection of itself. These dramatizations are beautiful to look at, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative scene. In all parts, the play is amazing, especially from Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of humanity. The photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will preserve forever. Finally, the music is simply amazing, which fits perfectly with the pictures, even though they are written and recorded before recording, adjusted during the editorial and then resumed. How much music affects the shot, I do not know, but it perfectly matches the picture. I have seen many ideas of what different people think the theme of the movie is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know the great things about life, death, etc. But I don't think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said that the film is just repeated.
