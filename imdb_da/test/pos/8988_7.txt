Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Though this is a deeply erroneous (and in some ways idiotic) movie, the way it constantly endures expectations is the decent thing to look at the adventurous losing fan. <br /> <br /> Meet yuppie college students Kevin and his gang of lovable frat boys boys. In what begins as a very real teenage comedy, we follow this bunch of smoke-offs and their fakes, which include promising to bind bricks to their genitals. The movie shifts shifting gear when Kevin's high school sister is raped and embarked on a coma by a bikerbike who apparently has nothing better to do. When she dies in hospital, Kevin claims revenge, much to his detective father. He has so far gone from Porky's little, through the last house on the left, to what seems to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick. But Kevin and his gang's portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they get killed-mad lunatics. It is for the film's credit that it does not glamorize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin is constantly emptying, while making it understandable that he will feel like he does. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from light heart to grimy and downbeat very quickly, and in the end it is so over the top and utilizing that it will leave you incredible. And that's the strength of this movie. You never know what to expect next. In more than 100 minutes, it's kind of a long time for this kind of fare, but you won't be bored. Poorly traded for the most part, with cardboard carvings for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and rather stupid dialogue, it will not soon be someone on the list of forgotten classics. I got a kick out of it myself and I'm sure someone is reading this knowing if they're ready for it.
