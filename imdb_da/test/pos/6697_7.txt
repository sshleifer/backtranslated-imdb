A mix of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> Starting very promising and then lowering to almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce features some amazing special effects they could make in the mid-80s. The story is exciting, but ultimately becomes a bit lacking in brilliance. It was rated R because of nudity, sex and gore. Mathilda May's ethereal and wild (naked) beauty is very evident throughout the film. A bizarre movie and costs a lot at the time it was made. <br /> <br /> This could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a good hit, I think it actually flopped pretty badly. <br /> <br /> So something went wrong with this, but it's still very entertaining.
