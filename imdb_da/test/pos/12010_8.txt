I was surprised when I saw this movie, how much it had "encapsulated" me. No, the actors did not act as typical 'Hollywood' actors, but it is not always bad either, as this movie proves. Completely different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing ride, nonetheless! They also give you a taste of what it probably was without being 'educational'. A movie everyone should both see and enjoy. Many people love to argue for 'accuracy' in any movie of this type, but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer. Mild grips; East and West Germany, looking at any map, would have West Germany on the left, east on the right. The movie sometimes puts you back a little, for about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left. Even during the same events, they change back and forth. Maybe just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction. Go see it!
