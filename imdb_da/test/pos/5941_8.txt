There are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. The amazing woman first panic and then, just a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young boy while the old guy is right next to her. But as the film goes along, we learn that she is a little fleeting girl (or blunt) and it partly explains her behavior. The film of this film is well done. We get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of these pictures and scenes really increase the excitement. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, an wannabe hot-shot grows old and is overcome by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, delivers a great performance, which, although he doesn't say much, is by far the best actor in this game. One critic complained about how unrealistic the movie was and that nothing really would happen. But then again, how realistic are movies like Mission Impossible or Phone Booth. Considering we are talking about a movie here and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that are not very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than many things I see on German television these days, and I think the vintage 80's style added something to this movie.
