Five Fingers in Death: Although former Shaw Martial Arts epics had shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, no one had paid such a tribute to it like this, especially in the saloon battle scene. And while Shaw Bros. movies had borrowed from the Japanese chambara (swordfight) genre before, no one had done so with such success. I suppose some of this had to do with the fact that the director comes from Korea and thus brought a non-Chinese perspective on such loans, which certainly raises some interesting issues about culture; but in any case, this film produced real innovations in technology and technology in Hong Kong's action film. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera got access to the whole set, which resulted in shots from many different angles, such as low-angle interior shots that showed the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation, usually credited to John Ford) or the high angle long shots that made it possible to visualize a large area of ​​land or the frontal tracking shot. It is true that this was not the first-hand film of real film material - it is Wang Yu's 'Chinese Boxer'; But on a commercial level, Shaw Bros had the right to choose "Five Fingers" as their first major release to the West, perhaps saying it was the smallest Chinese of their action movie, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theater traditions. While this did not express American critics at the time (which universally destroyed the image), it was not lost to American audiences, especially among African Americans whose culture had always been an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they had the opportunity to discover the core of history, in the serious young man who was forced to make extra efforts to overcome social barriers and fraud to gain recognition. This seems to be a universal issue for modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it; 'Five Fingers' presented it in a way that many Americans could relate to as well as Chinese. So is the movie now just of historical value? Certainly not. First, this problem is not gone. Secondly, some of the innovations leave much of the film that looks so fresh as in the first release. The action is also well-educated, and the performance, although a little too serious, is sharp. The film is very long, but the story covers much of the earth. And there are wonderful set-pieces through-out, such as saloon confrontation, the battle on the road to the competition, the odd double-finals. <br /> <br /> definitely looks better on a theater screen but still impressive for home viewing: recommended.
