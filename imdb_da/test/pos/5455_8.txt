*** SPOILERS *** This movie portrays the brutal carnage caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who would succeed him. Imaginations by David Letterman and Jay Leno performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performance was not great. Reni Santoni is the best performer of "execs" (he plays John Agoglia from NBC) and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is a close second. I was shocked by the way Littlefield eagerly discussed Johnny Carson's dumping. This was Johnny Carson! This scene evokes the television, what-you-have-done-for-me-latest television world. Kathy Bates delivered the film's best performance as Jay's agent Helen Kushnick. Another commenter claimed that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the movie. I disagree, respectively. The relationship with Kushnick borders on something resembling domestic violence. She orders him around, and when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentions her dead husband and son); But when Jay finishes their relationship, she becomes violent again and shouts: "Don't let me leave you in doubt!" before smashing a picture on the floor. Overall, the movie is fun and I want it to appear more often.
