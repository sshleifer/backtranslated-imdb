This movie has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of movie buffers, and it is a screaming shame. Its witty manuscript adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the big screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond adaptation, and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, who sees more than a decade younger than her 54 years - fifty-four! When she is on the screen, it blinks positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that may seem to be dated at the beginning, but it actually made me wish I was in the swing of the '60s. Hawn's fashion is as clever as Bergman's is smart. (It's a minor mistake - isn't her character a little too groom for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who wouldn't want to hang out on a Nightclub called The Slipped Disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliments I can pay for this movie is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw and that left me wanting more. Talking about having more, I wonder what ever became of sexy supportive actor Rick Lenz? (He resembles Griffin Dunne in this movie.) This was his movie debut, and I see no other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she has done so much since then it is easy not to be impressed, but I also can't imagine any other actor in the role. Since the movie is based on a game, the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y, but it does not hamper my pleasure at all. In fact, I am amazed at how much fun it is after over thirty and five years. Because this movie represents a bygone era, it has unwittingly slipped away from the consciousness of movie buffers. It is more connected to the ear films that came before it than those who followed. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the delights it has to offer. Degree: A
