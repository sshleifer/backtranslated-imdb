On the surface, TMHS seems to be another generic high school drama; But surprisingly hidden away underneath are huge amounts of depth, originality and eccentricities that not only make it viewers of the viewer, but also undoubtedly make it one of the best animations the medium has produced in the last few years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through Kyon's eyes, meeting on the first day of high school, Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly claims the rest of the class that she is not interested in "normal people" and The top of it off casually invites any foreigners, time travelers, sliders or espers to meet with her. Kyon stares in disbelief, wondering if he is funny or has a few screws loose. However, he cheats his gut instincts, he begins to talk to her. Thus, it soon becomes clear that she is not an ordinary high school student. Not long after, she creates her own appropriate SOS Brigade school club and draws Kyon among other very unfortunate people to join in. Nothing in this anime complies with the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes a witty tale to show. A waters from the usual 2D male leading figures that tend to fill the medium. The sections themselves are not chronological, forcing the viewer to think about the events that unfold and how they relate to past cases. This is a brilliant blow; the effect is like a jigsaw puzzle when a new piece is added, we get more of a sense of the bigger picture. Previous scenes have now been given completely new meanings, and the realization of them is deeply satisfactory. This, however, means that it feels cut off (that's all but), a very cleverly written script has bypassed this problem and ensured that it runs smoothly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story itself is strikingly original, but I do not want to dive beyond the simple bar chart plot I gave earlier, as it will undoubtedly destroy it for you. But what I want to mention is the plot contains a large selection of genres, from comedy to sci-fi. How they managed to accomplish this during fourteen episodes, lies outside of me and undoubtedly a huge achievement in itself. TMHS is a true gem that has such diversity and depth that it will appeal to virtually anyone interested in anime. See it, a bit unusual, it's something that lives up to the huge hype it has received - and even exceeds it.
