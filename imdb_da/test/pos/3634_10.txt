I rented this movie, but I wasn't quite sure what to expect from it. I was very happy to find out that it's about the best Brazilian movie I've ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple, and above all extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordestina, a city in the middle of nothing in northeastern Brazil, and deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves his small town and does not want to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and disturb the place. As a proof of his love for her, he decides to go out and bring the world to her. He will put Nordestina on the map as he says. And the way he does it is incredible. This is a good movie; may be a bit scary for some people because of its different editing jobs, but I also think it improves the story. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
