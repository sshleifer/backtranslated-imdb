The film was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts, but when I found them, I could see that the truth in this case was alien to fiction. Judith Light was terrifyingly hurtful in her role as a mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, which I felt was an excellent achievement. Rick Schroder was suitably clueless as his son who also defended her in court, an example of how difficult it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept a parent's actions, no matter how criminal they may be. You can find errors in the movie, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.
