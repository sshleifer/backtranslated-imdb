I think New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best unanimous review of In the Mood for Love when he said it's "dizzy with a romantic spirit that has been missed from the cinema forever." How true these words are! Really romantic movies are so rare these days, while movies containing lots of sex and nudity (often portrayed in smutty and free) are abundant. So, given this biographical climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest movie feels like a crowded fresh air. In Mood for Love, it's about the condemned romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan", played by Maggie Cheung) whose spouses have an illegal affair as they try "not to be like them. "But after hanging together on lonely nights (while their spouses are away" on business "/" taking care of a sick mother "), they fall in love and must resist the temptation to go too far . <Br /> <br /> Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "romantic melodramas" in the best sense of that term. First, the film's specific period (ie 1960s Hong Kong) is rebuilt to an astounding level of detail. The clothes (including Maggie Cheung's lovely dresses), the music (for example Nat King Cole) and the general atmosphere of this film evoke a nostalgia for that specific period. Secondly, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful filmography creates an environment that not only encloses its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in each of its lavish, meticulously crafted frames. Don't Mistake It: In Mood for Love was the most beautiful movie in 2001. (It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyperkinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this movie, though his pallet remains as colorful .) Third, there is the joking score of Michael Galasso, accompanied by slow motion sequences of eg Chan walks in his elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "glancing" at each other as they pass each other on the stairs and others beautiful scenes that eat in their memory. The main story - which makes its instruments sound like they are literally crying - is heard eight times at various points in the movie, and it serves to highlight the sadness and longing that the two main characters feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung have both delivered amazing performances (Leung won the award for best actor in Cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on the screen. The above elements assemble and work so nicely together to make a movie that feels timeless, "dizzying romantic" and in a word magical. In Mood for Love, maybe more than any other movie from 2001, reminded me why it is that I love to "go to the movies." And I suppose it's about the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
