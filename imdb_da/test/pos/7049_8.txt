I know it was a goofy movie, but I enjoyed it immensely. It's one of the experiences that makes me smile when someone says "Bill Murray." I almost always like movies that involve underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. It's generally a friendly movie - some of the adults aren't wrapped tightly, but the laughter rather than brutally accepts as many teen movies these days. The rich children over the lake take a blow, but no one I know at all. I never went to the camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks went right. They were even underestimated at times, but I'm sure it was an accident. The piece worked well, with Bill Murray showing hints about what he would be like. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but hey, a good greasy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then ... it's just as important .................. .............
