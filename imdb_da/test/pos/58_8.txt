Superb editing, excellent action, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and extremely enjoyable musical soundtrack. This movie dates back to the 40s to comment on the healthy lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation, while weaving the true story of a truly admirable and stunning lady. The actor, depicting the young Terrence Howard character, does a wonderful job reflecting the upbringing of life and times in the small town of New York. The audience laughed, shouted and broke out in applause for the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7 I think) - fire up TIVO and enjoy a great story!
