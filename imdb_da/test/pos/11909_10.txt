I liked this movie. It's pretty much everything I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a great job even though I'm still very disappointed with him after all of the Iron Eagle movies. And even though I smiled on the inside when the first headdress dies (I don't want to give it away) it was done in a good and appropriate way. Almost everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! It's another of those movies I found really cheap so I bought it and I recommend the same.
