This movie is amazing. Stylish, fun, good acting. I had seen it described differently as 'lock, store and two smoking muscles' and 'Reservoir Fops', both of which are excellent descriptions. The reason is simple, but it does not detract from the enjoyment. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunk gentleman. The sets and costumes are amazing, and music and cameras are refleshingly unusual for a 'costume drama'. Sans and Sensibility it's certainly not !!!!! My recommendation? Go see it, sit back with a big tub of popcorn and have a good time.
