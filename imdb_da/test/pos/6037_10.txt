Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra leader who has a secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to murder her and make it look like she had committed suicide. Diseases for him are our space-based detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), on the case. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, following amazing details with amazing details. We see that the villain commits his murder and sets his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we are completely confused. So when Columbo appears on stage, it gets even better. <br /> <br /> We see Columbo only after the murder (as usual). This time he is with the vet with his new dog. Scenes of pure comic relief are usually the weakest in the show (think Columbo's discomfort over the naked model in "Suitable for Framing"). Columbo is fun when he dithering or bumbling intentionally to raise his quarry; But for many writers, the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he is with non-suspects. Bochco, on the other hand, shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are fun and artistic integrated into history. (And I am grateful that he didn't mind Columbo's attempt to name the dog. As far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk gets the most out of them. He is especially good at a monologue where he expresses disbelief that everyone could kill himself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he is even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with Cassavetes. That these two friends and business partners would play each other brilliantly in the long term can be expected; And that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict can't help admiring the great Columbo, even though the brilliant detective stretches the cord around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When Columbo goes to the question for Benedict's snooty mechanic, of course? of course! ?? He asks the man to look at his own beat-up pile. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before the rehearsal, of course? of course! ?? he is on piano playing "chopsticks." And what should our violent lieutenant bring with him, but the victim's typewriter with the fake suicide leaf still in the roll. Columbo also has good scenes with a little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely Blythe Danner, who plays Cassavete's wife. It's great to see Myrna Loy emerge as Danner's mother, though she does a little with her minor role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, especially as Coach in "Cheers") makes the perfect honest job even though he follows the lead of almost all other "Columbo" directors by adding one or two stupid blooms. Scenes end by going out of focus and starting to get in focus. Then there is the little where Cassavete's looks clove he fell on the crime scene? and we see a zoom-in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old fogies that are terribly done by all but Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> However, there are quibbles. This is a fantastic entertaining episode, the kind that made me a "Columbo" fan.
