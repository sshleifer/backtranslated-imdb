A man comes in a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no one feels any sense and occupies the place instead of decor. His essential context is reminiscent of 'Groundhog Day'; The strange passages in and out of this world are more like one of 'Being John Malkovich'. But it's really a Scandanavian movie, a piece of self-satire that is also Scandanavian in style: the tone is tight, and even the most amazing scenes are played straight and daring to laugh at the absurdity. In my opinion, the combination is not entirely successful: There is not enough real laugh to compensate for the difficulties of taking the play as pure drama. It is definitely original; Perhaps my problem is that the world it is satirizing is not one that I recognize. Maybe I'll move to Scandanavia!
