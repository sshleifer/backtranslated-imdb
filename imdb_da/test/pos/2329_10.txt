I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope are hilarious, but it also has a heart. The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, a work of art comes alive. So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the Aircraft Carrier USS Ranger (which accounted for Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a large ship, was "conventionally powered", which could mean that Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this may have been on stingray since Korea! This may end in 1966! Buckman: (Finger finger full and tasting it) What's something, sir? It still tastes like creamy corn. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (Yelling) Except, it's DEVILED HIM !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> It was the story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to like him so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a shocked but still seaworthy Balao class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to escape the nuclear fleet and "attacked" Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star and a courage against Dodge) awarded him the ragtag staff, hoping they would turn up so Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge get the crew faster and work as a team and can he take an old, obsolete part and beat the fleet best?
