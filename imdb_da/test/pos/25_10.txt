This is a movie that deserves a different look - if you haven't seen it for a while or a first look - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a game of the same name, it is the story of an older actor leading a touring Shakespeare repertoire company in England during World War II. It's about his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare every night while facing problems like bombing theaters and a company of elderly or physically disabled actors - the young people who are able to be taken to military service. It is also about his relationship with various members of his company, especially with his chest of drawers. So far it sounds a bit boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. While it is tragic in general, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high. The two male leaders both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deserved it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. Backstage goings-on is another part of the film that will be fascinating to most viewers.
