Ettore Scola's masterful reproduction of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. It is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics, such as Vischontis Senso and Il Gattopardo, as well as Rosselini's Vanina, Vanini. The 19th century is actually a fertile source of Italian filmmakers. The settings and trappings of the period are beautifully realized here, but the story is timeless and can occur in any period. What is so exciting in this story is that the hero is caught in a claustrophobic situation where he finds himself the highly-persecuted object of desire and he is quite powerless to rid himself of the alarming circumstances. Stylish and sticky Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light-minded married woman (Antonelli) and fall prey to the dangerous passion of the enchanted Fosca (D'Obici) (Girotti). The resulting anxiety and the subsequent tragedy that this unlikely couple goes through make them both understandable, pitiful and extremely sympathetic to the viewers. Bernard Giraudeau's star performance will impress and leave a lasting impression. Not to be missed.
