I saw Anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the successor in 2003 and since I see many foreign films in different genres, you probably have to watch movies in their original language. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, just as the whole movie is a great long toothpaste commercial or something. It makes an otherwise amazing movie seem awful, and I have had to convert many of my friends who used to believe that foreign films are not as good as North American movies - that they are not "Hollywood enough". Also the translation is never real, it is too literal and screws up in the movie, although it basically says the same thing. I watched Anatomy even the second week in German and then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn't want to miss parts because he couldn't see the subtitles because he wrote. 30 minutes in and he asked me to let him finish his work and then start the movie with subtitles. He loved it! Both movies are awesome as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
