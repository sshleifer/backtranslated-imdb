This is one of L & H's shorts, most often cited as the first "real" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piemonte Mumblethounds (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the ports to greet his nephew Philip, whom he has never seen. Initially, Ollie laughs at everyone when this strange little man carries and draws much attention to himself in the way he behaves during his medical examination, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that he is who he is need to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness - women. Mumblet dogs and Philip sat down to go home, but their journey is constantly interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman and then chasing after the woman. Large crowds gather each time it happens, not so much because he is hunting for skirts, but because Philip himself wears a skirt (a kilt). Finally, Mumblet dogs manage to pull Philip to a tailor shop to be measured for a real pair of pants, but Philip also escapes from there to hunt more skirts. There are lots of laughs around. It is also nice to look briefly like this because the boys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it is such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from the character of his usual human child. It shows that he was not a one-trick pony and excelled in other roles when he got the chance. With a maturity of 19 minutes, it is short and sweet and gives classic liners that still have me stitching.
