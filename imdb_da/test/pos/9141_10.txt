With some wine, some friends and good humor I had a really good time watching this movie. I especially enjoyed Jilon Ghai (like "Randy") who was such a kick in the pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were wildly entertaining. I didn't want him coming to me but it was good to see "Randy" trying to score with "Michelle" and even better seeing the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are also very funny to watch. And one of my friends showed me the PLAYBOY question, which had Pilar Lastra as the month's Playmate. She is definitely looking. All in all, this movie served its very purpose, which was to entertain us in an easy and carefree way.
