Wow, I can't believe I'm the first and only to write a comment on this amazing movie. Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this, Matt Lillard, most likely people either think he is too caffeine happy or just plain sucks, but we are both in the same age and from the same generation, and I've seen this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few films where he is the big shot and the star as in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> Baiscally this is storywise your usual hoist movie but with more twists and turns than anything else that begins to correspond to madness. Also very remarkable in this movie is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a much appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a beginner and she is not that bad, even though you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the naked scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each Want to reap the benefits, but share with no one. They all try to get each other to kill off the other, and it's an hour bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true skill as the twilight JAck that initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a few art thieves who need money due to lack of business. Vince's character is a little scared and sketching throughout the film, but it only adds to the film's intensity. The surprises that are left and right are welcome and the end is very non-clich√© and makes you feel happy, maybe it depends on the type of conclusions you like. This movie kept me very interested in that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics will probably not like this movie, but they do not see movies because they still like movies.
