Anderson's animation easily competes with Pixar and goes far beyond most things I've ever seen Disney do. While some say the story is a little too abstract, I find it a thought-provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated figures and bumbling animals that are typically found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left home and moved to a lonely, frightening place alone will easily identify with this abandoned microbe. Excellent work, Mr Anderson! <br /> <br />
