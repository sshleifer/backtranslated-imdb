Wow! A fantastic, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70's glam rock movie rolled into one. This movie just guarantees to see what can be done next to no budget, but a lot of enthusiasm. As a tale of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious, but it is rescued by its eccentricities. The chance of a glimpse of how glamrock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This movie used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of movie that Oz is. Although it is not as ruthless or well constructed as RHPS, it is hard not to have fun with Oz. Oz has surprised that Oz has had a good age - perhaps a by-product of how it is determined in real Australia in 1976, that is. The passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream. The film's willingness to give prominence to homosexual characters is remarkable, especially as it dates to the 'revolution' period of Australian gay rights. <br /> <br /> The performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced shine. The direction is lacking in subtlety, and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two. Somehow, these errors add to the appeal of the movie, which is mercifully unpretentious. Much like Australia in the 1970s, this film has a certain naive charm. There are several connections to the original Australian stagings of the Rocky Horror Show, which will keep obsessives on their toes. <br /> <br /> Oz is certainly a minor classic and a potential cult family worthy of appreciation. Laugh in the dreadful 70s fashion, swing along with the AusRock soundtrack, leave all expectations at the door and Oz will probably delight.
