The Death Count aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is a major underrated early work by director John Woo. The movie stars Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and have Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in significant supporting roles. Many people believe or have been led to believe in misleading advertising that this is a Jackie Chan movie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie, Dorian Tan is the star, but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances. <br /> <br /> Handed of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) sent on a mission to murder a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Ten) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo). On his journey, Yunfei meets a young lumberjack named Tan (Chan) and an infamous sword fighter (Chang Chung) known as the "waterfront". Both men have suffered in Shih's hands and want to avenge themselves. The three quit to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort it revolutionary to safety. The martial arts are above average under the leadership of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses her trademark high kick very effectively as "northern eighteen style kicks" along with some "southern five styles boxing." Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also provide excellent martial arts performances. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen, but does an acceptable job. Some of the early games are a bit slow and seem to be choreographed, but the final showdowns with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. Director John Woo provides lots of interesting character development in the movie, which is refreshing. The movie of Leung Wing Kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu movie in this era. Joseph Koo's music: a combination of soft whistles and 70's "Shaft" style orchestra is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual Kung Fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious, just revenge-driven story. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistic of its time and an example of the great things that come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is presented here before his direct debut, and Han's early charisma and talent can be seen clearly. <br /> <br /> Hand of Death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu movie and an excellent early work by the legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." <br /> <br /> Tan: "Just a knickknack."
