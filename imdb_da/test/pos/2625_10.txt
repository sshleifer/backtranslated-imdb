I was a 20-year-old college student living with the people when I first saw it, and I have never forgotten it. I'm a great Joan Hackett fan, and this movie was perfect for her remarkable talent. I'm so happy to see that so many other people have such a boring memory to see this. Of course it is not available on any media! It would be perfect to show on Lifetime, but because of its age they will not. You never see anything there before the mid-eighties. I still remember what made me see it when it was first run: Rex Reed reviewed it in The New York Daily News, and he said it was a return to the big Hollywood films from forty and had it been made then, Hackett and Grimes parts would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P. S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
