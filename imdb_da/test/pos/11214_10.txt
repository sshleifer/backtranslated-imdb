Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the United States as "Distant", was directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge <br /> <br /> Ceylan. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a gritty and gloomy version of clash between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir and a "country mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are great actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their action skills. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the film was completed.) In most country cousin / cousin stories, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyle is portrayed in a humorous way. In this movie there is little humor or even warmth. Both men <br /> <br /> have lost touch with human society. Mahmut's work as a <br /> <br /> commercial photographer for a tile home gives him no satisfaction. He has separated a woman he clearly loves and has no satisfactory human relationships. <br /> <br /> Mahmut has lost his job because of a factory that closes in its small town and doesn't do I don't have the ability to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily limited to silent observations of the other people who cross their path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but cannot express these qualities in an urban environment. The cousins ​​do not relate well to the world and they have no connection with each other. It also does not make an effort to act in a way that will allow binding or closeness. <br /> <br /> In a way, this film portrays a waste of opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, every cousin could have given at least part of what was lacking in the lives of others. Instead, they control parallel unhappy courses. The two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film's title. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds details on details. These details tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple display. Uzak appeared as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It is not a "working environment" in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a working environment because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a quiet, absorbent, dark film. Although it does not give a good impression, I went out of the <br /> <br /> theater and realized I had seen a really creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. This movie is worth finding and watching!
