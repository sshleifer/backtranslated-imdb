I was lucky to attend the London Prime Minister in this movie. While not at all a fan of British drama, I found myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. I was in tears at the end of the movie. Every scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and the excellent plays were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I would agree with some of the other comments here where the question was, why did all these women fall into such a despicable nature. <Br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I also hoped Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job and radiated beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
