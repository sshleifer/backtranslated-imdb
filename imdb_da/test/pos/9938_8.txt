A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first big part in a staged game like Lady Macbeth thanks to the accident of production diva falling in front of a driving car. A success that wins her awards finds Betty (Christina Marsillach) instead of horror as the person responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in horrible ways. <br /> <br /> First, her stage leader boyfriend Stefano (William McNamara) is viciously broken with a knife while she has to look tied to a pillar in her uncle's grand mansion, closing her eyes off the needles scotch-wallpaper under the eyes, with dots a result if she blinks. Allowing her to escape, Betty finds herself in this unfortunate position when a special gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe, which has been torn to pieces by that bile, after killing a series of crawls fled from their cage in the equipment room, of the clothes designer, who was first knocked on the floor with an iron and subsequently hit by a pair of scissors (to pay tribute to this unpleasant scene, the chain in the neck falls with the killer having to cut her neck to find it, although Dario does not specifically elaborate this action, he uses the scissors ripping sound for optimal effect, with the camera often returning to the victim's dead face). Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, who plays him cold and bland at Dario's request) does not promise to get psycho as Betty relies on his few returning friends for comfort, the theater director Marco (Ian Charleson, GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF BRAND, who would later die of AIDS, a sad footnote revealed Dario in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shot that he was HIV positive, tried the scene after a successful horror film career despite the rejection of critics and pal Mira (Daria Nicolodi, Darios earlier squeeze), her agent and confidence. But the serial killer is right driven, and a showdown between them will obviously occur in the theater, as Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crawlers at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think it's Dario at his most savage and nihilistic. Though he has probably made later horrible films (... as his Masters of Horror entries and SLEEPLESS would suggest), this film really responds to pure violence against the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to see was admittedly a gag by Dario about the kind of audience who likes to look away from the more horrible parts of horror movies. I found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just had to blink .. Dario shoots the dot from a point of view and achieves a nuisance effect from our perspective as if we were those with scotch taped needles holding our eyes open. I like how Dario will show Betty's extended eyes, horrified by what she is forced to see, as some blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but to blink. The photographic work by Ronnie Taylor is impeccable, such as. The crow's point of view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. Or when the camera "travels" through space in the theater after the killer who wants to see his mouse from a box seat. Or the dream sequence where we are taken in Betty's memory of an event about her mother's death of a particular killer, gives the same mask and gloves as the one that causes her trauma at the moment. The highlight is, in my opinion, the peephole bullet fire sequence, masterfully set by everyone involved, as the camera follows a bullet that shoots through a victim's eye, which explodes from the back of her head, goes through a phone that Betty plans to need to call for help. We even get a collar pointing the eyes of the killer (.. to add to this evil scene, the collar is shown with the eye rolling around in the beak). The only aspect I didn't care about, often pointed out by the naysayers of the movie, is the "final" end that I personally felt was a little unnecessary, but I think Dario would point out that Betty wasn't actually like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies, who in a twist relates why the murderer plagues our heroine. The rock music that was used during the violent scenes did not disturb me because I felt that the moments of evil graphic attacks needed a crushing, which heavy metal can often give.
