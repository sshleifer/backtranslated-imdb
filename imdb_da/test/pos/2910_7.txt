I had the pleasure of watching this movie when I was 10 years old (has an existing interest in Egyptology). I know there are subtle bugs in the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best movie, to date with the appearance of the 18th dynasty. <br /> <br /> The movie is just about the plot of Mika Walter's "The Egyptian". A good portion of the text has never made it into movies, as we have to consider the running length. <br /> <br /> The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Performances as follows. The late Edmond Purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphan child adopted by parents past their childhood. He says he adheres to himself, has the best education available and lets us see it as a rather emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and a high intellect. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is fine as a humble tavern girl. honest loving and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent, yes she is a Babylonian. It is not so clear in the film why Sinhue is so insanely obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Her correct name. In the book, Sinhue enjoys his carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving Nefer Nefer Nefer's drug body with "The Dead" workers. <br /> <br /> Gene Tierney as the Baketaten is brilliant! When she tells Sinhue that he is pharoah, she looks like she could devour him (in her weakness). She is intense, brilliant and cold beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one God. I think we see the Ankhnaten through the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A view of the time that had a pre-messiah's feeling about the Ankhnat's call. Has his monotheism affected the Jewish people? Note Psalm 104 and other Egyptian pictures in the hymns? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov gave alter ego to Sinhue. He is street wise and clever a survivor. Excellent as always. <br /> <br /> Older people have never believed much of his actions personally. Hans Horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who ultimately has Sinhue murdered more than one person in his quest for power (Walteri's book). <br /> <br /> I felt that the end of Egypt was confusing as Sinhue's personality changed too easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), power is handed over to him through the half-sister Baketaten, he is world-conscious now and has a grip on international affairs. So was he informed? He could have changed the Amon Priesthood that he was capable of. <br /> <br /> No! Sinhue gives everything up, all including his son's future to become a shaggy beggar preaches monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the big mistake in the script! Appearance of the movie, the color, most costumes (Nefer Nefer Nefer's gold dress was too over the top as she is more dressed in the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I want to see this movie again easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know you know that Horemheb did not immediately succeed in the Ankhnaten, but I could not resist stating this fact.
