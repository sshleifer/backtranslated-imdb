This is undoubtedly the most demanding black and white war movie I've seen; In fact, the only Western director of this time was to approach the intensity level and pure visceral power of his work, Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had participated in a con Ichikawa retrospective at London's National Film Theater in September 2002, but only managed to capture some of his work done between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly as depressing as it is known to be; However, it also shows welcome details of black humor all the time - the 'dead' man who wakes up to respond to a questioning soldier and immediately 'dies' again, the delicious ironic showpiece, a moribund eccentric, telling the groomed hero which part of the body he should eat, etc. The script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and productive film maker whose reputation is not as high as it was in his highest year (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - the amazing pre-circle order (The hero is fiercely disputed by his superior officer to be exterminated from the hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a Japanese surrender in the hands of a Filipino woman with pistols, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away To save himself, the wounded soldiers left behind to climb out of the house at their own limited pace, it automated March in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (who also involve the aforementioned business with the shoes actually reminiscent of a similar scene in ALL THE FRONT FRONT [1930]), a hill scattered with the soldiers' body trying to climb it, the finals, etc. Surely one of the movie's great assets is the amazing filmography of the unforgivable and desolate, mu dry landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for dealing with the taboo object of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies), but the Ichikawa approach is not only subtle but very effective: the meat is actually referred to as "monkey" while the hero is only seen once (and immediately spits the piece with most of his decayed teeth!); Conversely, when the weakly leading soldier (played by Mickey Curtis, who, despite his name was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) is devoutly devoted, the earth is sprayed nearby with blood. In the dietary supplement, Ichikawa recalls that Method Practitioner Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set in hunger - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he was recruited! Donald Richie's convincing interview favors the film's nihilism over the underlying patriotism behind such a gut-wrenching recent Hollywood fare as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). FIRES ON THE PLAIN is considered universal to be one of its director's best efforts, and from the several films Ichikawa I've seen, the closest in the spirit is BURMESE HARP (1956; another character-driven war movie, but with a spiritual tone and also available on DVD from Criterium) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; in fact, a limited theatrical performance was given locally as part of a foreign film week a few years ago). Personally, I also have a particularly soft place for the director's astonishingly stylized color extraction, AN ACTOR'S INCOME (1963), which I have actually captured twice on the NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned 2002 retrospective.
