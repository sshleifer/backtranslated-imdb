I own a copy of this movie and have always loved it. I comment on this because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. This production was put on by San Francisco Opera and star George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 80s, Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for her performance as Mrs Lovett) performing Sweeney on Broadway. They must have made the film around the time I saw the show. So far, the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theater happened when Hearn sang: "These are my friends." ("These are my friends, see how they glide." "My arm is finished again!") Hearn's performance in San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he hasn't lost anything in the almost twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the movie. What a talent! He is sympathetic, fun and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy can he sing. All this reminded me of how amazing the movie is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
