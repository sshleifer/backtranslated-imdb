I laughed a lot several times during this movie, but give it a clear look and you would think it was something completely different. I love the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented with these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaues. Andersson gives us something else here. Showing us something I had not seen since his last movie. He is compositionally unusual and, through his method of attaching the camera and allowing action to take place in front of us, he opens the door to humanity, and we look into a place that reflects our own lives, our small lives. These are powerful things. It is the simplicity with which he allows events to take place that create the opposite sense of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I think most scenes, if not all, are set from scratch according to his designs. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. For me, it took me to a place, and I came out of it after experiencing a world frayed and beautiful, stiffened and pained, barren and awesome. At one time strangers and familiar. This movie is brilliant and life affirmative. I know because I came out, smiling feeling wonderful. It has taken him seven years to do this. If he only made one movie, he would still be up there with greats.
