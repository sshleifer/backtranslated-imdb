I watched the movie at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (world premiere). A joking, intimate portrait of loneliness and the consequences of letting it grow and become somewhat darker. <br /> <br /> The action of the two leaders (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and wants you to have met these characters before they became so damaged. Reminded me of the theme of Atomic Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (where I call from). Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and enhances moments in the film without paying attention to itself. <Br /> <br /> Recommend movies and audio tracks.
