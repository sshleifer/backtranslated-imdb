MÃ©ley's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously stylish "Le Samourai (1968)." I don't even think this is the best example of the much beloved heist subgenre. The main file against the film is its long running time. Meville has this tendency to concentrate on too many trivial details. He could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons that I don't understand, the movie seems to go over and over again. Still, the film is never boring. Melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very "cool" master thief. The movie's color photography is a great asset, and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very efficient way. Technically, the film is practically flawless. At times you get a feeling that Meville is just showing up, but when you are as talented as he is, you have little reason to complain. I still like other heist movies a little more (Jules Dassin's Topkapi (1964), "just to mention one), but there is no denying that this movie is a great mass entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as" cool "movie theater.
