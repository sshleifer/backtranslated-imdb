What impressed me most about "One True Thing" was how it was all over since the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. As depressing, the subject was that it was a refreshing change in pace rather than being blindsided by the revelation of a character's mortal disease 2/3 in the movie ("Love Story" Terms of Endearment, etc.). <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt provide very strong performances that do not cross the edge. The characters they play seem human; They are not perfect people. (Perhaps you can't say that about the "Martha Stewart" type character Streep plays, but throughout the film I found her character to be noble in a non-juicy way. She deals with her situation the best way she knows how to . <br /> <br /> "One True Thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama, in which the tears at the end were well deserved.
