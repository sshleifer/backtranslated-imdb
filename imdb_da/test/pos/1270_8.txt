Christopher Nolan's first film is a "no budget" black and white film about an unemployed writer who begins to follow strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. It is very good. <br /> <br /> As in his later movie 'Memento', he does not present the story linearly. Instead, it jumps around something so you end up really craving trying to piece it all together and early, seemingly random, footage takes importance when the movie progresses. This style also means that the turns are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and / or Film Noir)
