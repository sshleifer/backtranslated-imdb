This video was my first introduction to the residents and I couldn't stop playing it in the last three days. The visualization is dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than anyone I've ever seen on the big screen or the small one. <br /> <br /> The DVD loses points for the meaningless addition of new music. The original Resident music is unlike anything you have ever heard, and will truly adapt your brain in the best possible way. However, the new music is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather poor in relation to some of the classic tracks. Also, the incomplete Vileness Fats video feels very incomplete, and I could only grasp the history of history from extensive reading of the notes on the disc. With this note on the disk, this DVD has many cool Easter eggs that are likely to appeal to residents for a long time. Tip: Look for icons on the notes that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best DVD downloads available. There is virtually no observable pixelization, and only a little edginess in strong contrast points. <br /> <br /> Kudos for a top notch presentation. This disk really deserves your attention.
