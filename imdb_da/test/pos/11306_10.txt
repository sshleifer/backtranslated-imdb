Usually I try to avoid Barbie movies, but this was unmistakably fantastic. Kudos for graphics and character voice overs. It all flows well. This enchanting tale is a great spin off of others, but it is worth buying! I don't have kids, but the kids I babies (including boys) find it exciting and love the extra features of the DVD. I honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin '8 year old will love this. It's not exactly and predictably like most movies are. This "childrens" movie has excellent morals and shows teamwork. It has no gang, bit of romance (if you're old enough to figure it out) and beautifully written history. That's why I give it ten out of ten!
