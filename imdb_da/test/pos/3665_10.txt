I've seen my lovely Bollywood movie as they grow up - you know that the typical plot boy meets girl, the girl rejects boys, dakus (bad guys) take away girl, boy saves girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they managed to get married of course I have omitted one hour of musical style numbers) .. Well in seeing Hari Om, I expected another typical Bollywood style movie; But to my delight, it turned out to be atypical and actually quite comical. Bharatbala's Hari Om is what could be felt as one of the 'off beat' Indian movies as the ever popular South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East are east or bend it like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Be South-South Asian decent and after watching various classic Bollywood movies, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialogues that could be retrieved that reminded me of the fun and charming side of Indian culture (f The various indo-pop numbers that were actually recreated by Nitin Soni or the witty Indian snakes used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asian people and is also entertaining for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor, as signs and plots are addressed to all audiences. <br /> <br /> In a cocunut shell, the movie of auto-rickshaw driver (aka 'four-wheeler' for those of you who have traveled to India) is played by Vija Raaz (from Monsoon Wedding), Who gets himself involved in a villain and ends up being due to him a lot of money. In order to avoid selling his four-wheeled 'Madhuri', he escaped serendipitously with 'Madhuri' and a very charismatic and lovely woman from France, Isa (Camille Natta), who himself escapes the torture of his girlfriend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour, who was in the swimming pool). The film is of their journey across the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan ?? The land of love stories; Through humor you see the two main players trying to figure out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the night most memorable was having the director, the managing producer, the editor-in-chief, and even the wife of Mrs. Night present at the screening. After talking to Bharatbala (who actually has a zoological background), many interesting tidbits of the film were uncovered, including: having the film completed only 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to shoot and only having five players in the game (the rest were all first time real actors). When I got home, I realized two things from the movie - that there is always a human connection between some of us despite our differences and secondly, as the director had said, 'Everyone has a love story'. <br /> <br /> It's a must SEE for everyone!
