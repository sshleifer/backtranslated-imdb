I don't usually like this kind of movie, but worked at home and wanted something halfway to see while I was doing. I was so confused that I gave work to sit and finish watching the last half hour continuously. And I usually don't care for tears over this kind of show, but I cried at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great play and good southern feeling. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there and the guy who played Luke was also good. Highly recommend.
