This is a fabulous movie. The plot is a good yarn and is imaginatively told in a variety of flashbacks and alternative views. What was conscious and what was coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You get the chance to put yourself in the shoes of each of the characters again (sometimes literally) and it helps define each character to a satisfactory depth. <Br /> <br /> With a little effort after the twists you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the movie recur from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Use the apartment if it comes back to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than keeping you guessing, the plot turns to such an extent that you just sit and see what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict! <br /> <br /> But more likely you need more than one view - I saw this on the pictures at its original release three times, and it got better every time. The actor was very good, with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice demolished in three directions by the other three characters in the ensemble. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best film from the 1990s.
