I thought this was great movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a woman who has fallen head over cures in love with Richard Greicy's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect, except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, but she has difficulty trying to get pregnant. Richard Greico will do everything to make her happy and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the play was great in this movie and it keeps you guessing. It shows how naive one can be when they are in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she has never done so in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as the deceiving man and plays the evil part very well. I wonder why certain actors do it and some do not. All and all a fantastic movie that I would recommend.
