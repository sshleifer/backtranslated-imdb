Hi again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to each other, kindness and charity. You forget it's the errors that are related to each other. It was as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such beautiful color in this movie. I need to watch this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie that I just can't remember "why" of it. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
