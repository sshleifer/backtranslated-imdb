Mrs Stowe is sensational in this power drama of a secret policeman who interrogates a child's writer because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to state. This is an incredibly powerful movie. Both performances are worthy of more recognition as it is the announcement of this film. Put this on your must see list if you can find it.
