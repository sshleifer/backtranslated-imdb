Three zany pairs, all SIX OF A KIND, are rooted in a madcap search for stolen bank cushions. <br /> <br /> This is a lively, fun comedy with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - constantly committed to doing what they did best: few laughs. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland make another of their movie appearances as husband and wife - this time it's more amorous than normal. They were a perfect team - she is the runaway lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and dominates most of the screen time here. From the beginning to the end they are a pleasure. Burns & Allen continues the teats they come from in Vaudeville, perfected on the radio and will ultimately go to the television with George the eternally straight man & Gracie the eternal fool. At times in the movie, she tends to go a little over the top, but it's hard not to like her. Her heart was of course made of solid gold. While Skipworth is given concise - only fragments of her formidable personality blink through - Fields is in his element as the indivisible sheriff in Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether he explained how he got the nickname lig John lig Honest John 'or night-shouting looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. Best of all, he does his entire classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful descendant. Finally, he performs the closest miraculous - he makes Gracie close. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the principles of another comedy. Only fields disturbed. He felt that he had now come to the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The studio finally agreed and started preparing Fields' first solo feature you tell me (1934).
