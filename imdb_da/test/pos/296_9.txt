I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months, and I never get tired of it just because it's perfect. And it also has the best movie music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean, you just love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can't believe Kramer vs Kramer won an Oscar instead of this amazing war movie. So that's my conclusion if you take the director of the world's greatest movie (The Godfather) and the best of Hollywood actors, you can only succeed. Now I just have to write something to get this preview, so don't read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
