Red dust is both well-traded and well-made, but what the film is about, I think, will drill many viewers as it did for me. There was a movie that was formerly called "in my country" with Sam Jackson and it was not so well received, and both films were almost the same, I think Red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially for future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is just to be missed, it starts quite heavily, but then the movie hits the viewers with countless uninteresting legal compositions, it could have been a great movie if the writing was not so lacking. But look to the performances.
