This is made for TV movie by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family oriented. Just Desserts are a boy and a girl, fall in love with the work with movies. Two bakers compete for a $ 250,000 prize against an area of ​​professional bakers. It's fun and easy heart. The desserts look good. The movie has a catchy, optimistic little song played during the competition. I suppose it's made for the movie song by Roger Bellon. Too bad that no soundtrack is available. I really want a copy of the song. I don't even know the name of the song because the credits are cut at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of campaigns. Anyway, the cast is great. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always a plus, and Costas Mandylor rounds out the good guys with a fantastic performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. The movie is worth seeing.
