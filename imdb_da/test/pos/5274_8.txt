It's a confusing, Absurdist Short. A mill, dressed in white, makes its way towards us from a windmill in a deserted landscape. Although the image is paired, there is an obvious logic here. But he's stopped by cowardly, all in black because of his work. They start to mumble with each other for no particular reason - has snooty miller offended the Sotic sweep? Is this class war? <br /> <br /> Whatever he does, he sets his opponent apart with sack bags flying all over the game, making superfluous everything he had done before the battle, and making the windmill redundant so everyone is as meaningless as the battle. The grain of the mill whites the darkness of the wound - later western would not be so subtle, heroes and villains become color coded. Is there a racial color here? <br /> <br /> If this wasn't strange enough, the fighters were chased by the screen of a lot of people coming from nowhere, a proper Kafkaesque ending in an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a struggle that rejects order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of the early silent cinema. This mix of comedy, surrealism and the Absurd is an obvious precursor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's 'Foreign Correspondant'.
