I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high for what your "heroes" might be in. And if there's one thing I've learned to expect a lot from the people you simply love to see and listen to , it never expects too much because in 99 out of 100 times you are disappointed. <br /> <br /> Even when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even can I downgrade my expectations for this movie" and as a result, today I was ready to laugh, but also ready to say at last "Well it was ok, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong I was! Every member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one and shows you one crazy asshole after another, so the whole world sees that there is nothing they usually do to try to harm themselves - and that is what we love! I shouted my eyes and laughed from the first moment until the last second of the movie, even shouting in laughter and couldn't control myself! Stunt after stunt, prank for prank and hilarious comments on the flow - it simply can't get any better than this! Great from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass. I have two things to say; SEE IT, and PLEASE GOD, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly have a lot to offer!
