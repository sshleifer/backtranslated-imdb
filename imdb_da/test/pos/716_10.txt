I see many movies - DVDs, features and classics you name it. The night I looked at JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it when she was in high school that it had been with her all these years. Something reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter and son) and got riveted from the opening sequence to the final titles. We were all. <br /> <br /> She who remembered the original and our children (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about could not believe it. Our favorite scene? Bar no one when Peter Strauss so passionately slaps his fist down and says, "I would do it again!". It did not suggest violence because it was a defense crime, but it caused such intensity, we could not believe it. When his fellow mates gave him their food in support of his efforts, there was no dry eye in our house. <br /> <br /> Someone has to make more movies like this one. INCREDIBLE!!
