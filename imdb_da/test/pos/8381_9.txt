I've been a little disappointed with Tarantino ever since death proof. But I insist that it was only a little, because I can appreciate the amount of work in producing such a tribute to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has certainly driven Tarantino to the top rows in my universe. This movie can be summarized (albeit insufficiently) in a word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is an intense feeling in each scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes. From the start of the film, you feel compassion for the Nazi victims and are located in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the World War II World War II. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpredictable, funny, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives. I am sure I will escape my mind that is just as appropriate and positive. I will not go into an assessment of each character, but the other comments from other users summarize the understanding of the different notions. <br /> <br /> Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino "bad ass" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino makes more open references to other films. In fact, many dialogues near the cinema lessons were for the audience, the setting is partly on a film premiere; A reference to a movie is close to every corner. <br /> <br /> It is great to see that each language presented (German, French and English) is fairly straightforward and natural. I speak both French and English very fluently and are often disappointed with how English-speaking characters in French movies seem bad and how French-speaking characters in English / American films seem bad. Incredibly enough, Tarantino managed to get his actors to draw a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps set the audience in context of the historical context. Yes ; Soldiers, spies and citizens rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The picture / photograph is beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The clothes are perfect and the violence is transmitted orgasmically / realistically. No stopping is held back and the Nazis are often shown to be tortured. This does not open the film to all audiences; Graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. <br /> <br /> volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good that during the North American Inglorious Basterd's premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal I had to pee, but refused to go to not miss a single scene. I hope the picture conveys how much I feel about this movie and I am a hard-pressed audience to please.
