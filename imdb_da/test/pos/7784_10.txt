Well this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My two favorite actors did good work. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan rocked. Hope to see the Andaz Apna Apna part 2 soon as I heard that they will come back with part 2 too. I have a request for those who haven't seen it yet. please buy dvd and watch it you will not be bored. I watch this movie once a week. Everything else was also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good, it also has good songs. There is a certain feeling that will kill you from laughing Salman Khan did a really good role and also Aamir. <br /> <br /> watch movies excellent jobs by actors and instructors ..
