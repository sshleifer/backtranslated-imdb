The animation is still the slightly harder style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on an open fire, but already with this first regular episode, Bart Genius, humor begins to be more "layered", faster and greater characterization is already displayed. <br /> <br /> This episode defines Bart's "slacker" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Although it is the main theme of the entire episode (there is also a good secondary theme for Bart and Homer's father / son relationship), it is given us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the Simpsons playing Scrabble. Lisa comes up with "id" for her words - short, but something you need to be well-trained to know. She needs to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary, which has served as a way to pop up on the couch. Margin can only come up with "he". Homer has "oxidized" already on his hill in order, but does not recognize that it is a word so he presents "do" instead. Bart comes up with "kwyjibo" which he insists is a word. Similarly, in the episode's main plot line, Bart cheats on his IQ test, which causes him to be put in a special school full of gifted children. We know that it will probably not last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" have always had fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters, and more importantly, the way people with varies degrees of intellectual abilities fit into (or not), accepted (or not) and perceived in society. Apart from the beginning of the present-day Bart, Lisa, Homer and Margge's place in this context, this episode starts respectfully playing poker fun on geeks and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Through some of the dialogue of the students at the special school and some of the other references, including purely visual, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" is not going to pull any stroke by writing or speaking down to its audience. It may just be a cartoon, but it is a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and geeks should understand more than anyone else. And the fact, except that it's just a very fun show, is the key to the show's lifetime.
