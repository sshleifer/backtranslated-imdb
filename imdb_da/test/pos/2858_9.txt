I'm not sure why I chose to borrow from the mother of "Nurse Betty". I just think I heard a little bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did. "Nurse Betty" is an original and smart movie that has humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> This was one of Ren√©'s first major before it hit the big one in Hollywood. I can see why she is an incredible actress. The place where she finally understands what had happened and she is on her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you in on the movie she plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman standing by her violent husband, she is a waitress and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a particular sweet doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she accidentally sees a man's murder in a separate room, the murders she discovers are two clients she's just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She just loses her thoughts and leaves the city after talking to the police and says she must find her former fiancee, Dr. Dave Revell. So she travels across the country to California to find Dr. Revell, and wants a job as a nurse working with Dave, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just great to be a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. Although everyone tells her she is misleading, she just looks at them as if they were the mad. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and thinks he and her belong together. <br /> <br /> Renee was great, she was so credible about losing her mind in the movie. She has come so far and you want to understand it or not, she is sweet and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the assassin's, Charlie, the father of the two. He is so charmed and infected by Betty, and while she is chasing her around the country, he is almost confused with Betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley will find Betty when they find out she was on the murder scene and could give away their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she is first scared, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock, son Wesley. He is so "gun" -why just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. I loved his comic performance at the end, where he and the band he held hostage at gun point just saw the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie that I would recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice, honest little movie, I think someone could enjoy. 9.10
