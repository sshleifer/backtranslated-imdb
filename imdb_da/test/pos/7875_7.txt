Imagine the "Dragnet" section where Friday and Gannon enter a typical 1970s hippie inequality, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they "get something". It's "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This movie from a working-class bigot and a strange guy who has just killed his girlfriend's drug dealer girlfriend is dated terribly and most of the supporting plays are stolen, but it's still interesting to see. Peter Boyle, about 35, plays Joe (bigot), and he looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the dead-eye daughter, and while she doesn't necessarily suggest her future grandeur, you can't take her eyes off her.
