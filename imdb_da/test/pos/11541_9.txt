I will put this as clearly as possible to those who are unaware of Bill Hicks' legacy. He was simply the largest stand-up comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the greatest ever lived (his stand-up idol is the great Richard Pryor whose struggles with addiction he paralleled). His death in 1994 was hardly noticed in the popular media that came just weeks after Kurt Cobain's suicide. His tragic death at such a young age darkens any sense of the injustice he was criminally ignored during his life, of course. But the hard truth is evident as day: No one has pulled up to claim his cloak. There is no stand-up comedian alive with almost skill and invention. The observation is made in the loving tribute "It's just a trip" that stand-up comedians often see the job as a step stone for richer pursuits - lame movies and morally driven sitcoms that are busy occupying - but never enriching - life to an imaginative audience. That's all Bill Hicks spoke against. His sermon was always a rally creep for people who think of themselves, to investigate the authority, to come together as a race. His appeal continues to grow every year since his death. His star will continue to shine long after so many smaller lights have blown out. Once you have been exposed to his brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate production, you will be enriched and rewarded. The man himself was happy to quote Dylan: "To live outside the law you must be honest," he said. Bill Hicks was honest, except he was the funniest of them all.
