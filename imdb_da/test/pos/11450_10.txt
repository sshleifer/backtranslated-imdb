I neglected this movie when I used to go to the movie store, but then the curiosity came to me and I decided to check it out. I loved it !!! The movie starts with Judy and Jay heading for a Halloween party at the abandoned Hull House funeral home. Then we meet a few characters, Angela and Suzzanne (the hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. So, of course, they begin to party, and when they are really in the mood, they decide to have a soul that awakens a demon. Death holds Angela and she starts her cruel slaughter. Will they survive the Devil's Night. <br /> <br /> The movie was generally large. Gore was fine, but the nakedness provided by Linnea Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) again screws it. I was never a fan of her and will never be.
