This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me continue it. This movie was a bit like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. A father of 12 princesses becomes very ill. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secretly magical land thanks to the stories of their dead mother. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their beautiful prince. It was a fun movie and I and my friend had fun watching it. We enjoyed it very much and also enjoyed the Indian speaking parrot. The music was very nice and made the film even bigger. It had a good classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and sweet. I liked it, so enjoy the movie it's good for the family. All in all I would see it again.
