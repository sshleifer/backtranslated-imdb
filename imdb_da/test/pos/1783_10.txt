Having seen the full length movie Kieslowski made out of this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, came back to this viewer as we saw the complete ten vignettes. As with the other films, this is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "Do not kill". Kryzsztof Kieslowski, who writes with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a violent crime by murdering an innocent person to shed his own frustrations. This episode has a Dostoyevskian character, reminiscent of "Crime and Punishment", or at least some of the novel's qualities are sent to the speechless youth who apparently have no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man as he walks around the city streets without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only bid moment he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored. Kieslowski leaves it to destiny to get the killer boarded a taxi for the purpose of stealing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that makes the best of this youth kill a man who does not deserve to die. The last moments in this criminal are one of the most poignant sequences in any movie, past or present. The second element in history is the relationship between the public accused and the criminal. Nothing can prevent the right to condemn the young man to death. In the end, the lawyer feels that he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong. All he is asked by the young man is to pick up the picture and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes a surprising movie that will remain in the viewer after this episode is forgotten.
