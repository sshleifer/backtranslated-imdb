I don't usually like romantic movies, but I love this movie a lot. The story is really moving, and the end is very appropriate. I feel I really care about many characters in this movie. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel loose and bored, I get involved, starting from the Capshaw scene, running along the beach with Scott until the end. I will rate this movie 11 out of 10 because I will give an extra point to the end. The working part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a great opportunity to show off her talent. Although I am not impressed with Scott in the "Dead Man on Campus", this film completely changes my point of view against him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as amazing as ever. This movie may not be as good, complex, deep or trustworthy as other movies that deal a little with the same kind of relationship, like "L 'ecole de la chair" or "Post coitum, animal sad", but "The Love Letter" can Still proud of himself, as it rarely casts a different light on this kind of relationship, and that difference makes this movie extremely enjoyable, by being unambitious and relying on great charms of small stars, Dreamworks, this time you truly make my dream to reality.
