Twins Effect, starring some of HK's most popular stars provides one of the most entertaining movie experiences to get out of HK at once. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This movie cannot be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be dissapointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and just watch the movie for fun, you have to enjoy it. <br /> Great special effects, great action, cute twins, cool HK actors, FUN movies! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone!
