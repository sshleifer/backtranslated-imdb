With the title of the sick movie ever made, PINK FLAMINGOS is an undisputed classic. It is certain that the camera is shaky and outside, the story is confused and slow, and every character in the movie is contradictory and contemptible, but PINK FLAMINGOS has some playful charm and brilliant satirical humor that no other movie can match. <br /> <br /> While this movie is an offensive one, reading descriptions of what's going on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can succeed in rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia, and almost any other form of human degradation known to man seems quite fun. This film should be seen as believed.
