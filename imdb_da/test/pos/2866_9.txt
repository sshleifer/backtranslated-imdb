This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits rolled, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones who made the stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was completely gay! When we saw this, we moaned. We thought it was like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They fulfilled themselves with this movie. It was gory, smart and scary, which are the combinations for a fantastic horror movie. Kane is great as Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did pretty good jobs as part of a group of criminals who cleaned an old motel. It had some gross scenes and you are actually a little sad for some of the people who die. All in all, a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends. Just don't look at a hotel.
