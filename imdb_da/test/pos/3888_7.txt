My original title for this review should be, "Ending disappoints, Film triumphs." But I actually thought of this on the way home. It's not the fairy tale, most of these movies are, it takes shifts that are different, and while the ending is disappointing, it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfactory note. The plot follows a man named James Aaron (Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed) a giant actor living in Chicago with his mother and dealing with both his obesity and his inability to find someone to love. Yes, it sounds corny, but it does experiment with elements that make it a little unpredictable and actually make you want it to be longer. The ending came suddenly and had me saying, "That's it!" But when it starts to take it, it really gets smile. It has many tones of seriousness throughout, but does not fear, because it is also very fun. Some scenes offer big laughs, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up recognize a couple. (Primarily when giving a career talk for his niece's nursery class and bombs). It begins with something of a serious note that you do not expect, but what follows is very fun, entertaining and also quite exciting. It's the kind of movie you're watching and always enjoying. And, as I said before, while the end might seem absurd at first, when you take the time to think, it's a real joy.
