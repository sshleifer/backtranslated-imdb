I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: A fun little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Plot views are available everywhere so I won't go into details. Michael is not about a complex plot anyway. It just builds on a good premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful drive. <br /> <br /> John Travolta's performance as a chain-smoker, lady-lover, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is just perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? <br /> <br /> See this if you want a few laughs and a good time. Highly recommended.
