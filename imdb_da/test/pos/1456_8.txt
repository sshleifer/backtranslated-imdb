The man with a golden arm was one of a trio of amazing films around the same time dealing with drug abuse. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three, one is the best. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Otto Preminger had shot the case in real Chicago instead of the obvious studio sets, the movie could have been better yet. Who knows, maybe Preminger could not get enough money to pay for the location. That's the only mistake I find in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin-dependent card dealer who was busted to cover his boss Robert Strauss when the fight was raided. He took the health into prison and wanted a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people gather against him. <br /> <br /> First, Bob Strauss wants him back, especially because a couple of gravity players are in town. He uses a few handheld methods to get Sinatra's services back. Second, Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra well and connected as a customer again. And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife, working with a game to beat everyone, just to keep him around. Frank Sinatra was nominated for Best Actor for this movie, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra could have won for this if he hadn't won for from here forever in the Supporting Actor category a few years back, and that Marty was such a recognized film that year. His scenes going through retreat locked in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker doesn't get enough credit for his role. She really is something like the crazy scheming wife who wants to have Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost is. If she had not been nominated the same year for Interrupted Melody, she could have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the highlight of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin received his first real notice as the very Serpentian drug peddler. His performance guarantees that your meat creeps. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein contributed to a great jazz score to highlight the bad Chicago neighborhood that they died in. Not a place you'd like to bring your family.
