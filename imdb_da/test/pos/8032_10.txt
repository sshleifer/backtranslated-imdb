2002, Bourne Identity is one of my all-time favorite movies. But many fans of the book have complained that the film had very little to do with the book's plot. <br/> <br /> The task is the real deal. It is strange that no one on the "Bourne Identity" threads has mentioned this film at all. (Yes, I did.) Besides the excellent plot, I personally found that this movie was as good as any espionage movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne <br /> <br /> Identity itself. The action is completely realistic. I especially liked the protagonist's training regime, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> The feeling is dark and greedy. There are a few surprising plot twists. The action is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
