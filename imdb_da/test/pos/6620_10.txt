If you've ever been, have a friend or child who is or was skating at once, then look at this flick! I have seen it several times and I get something new from it every time I see it. It reminded me why I first went on skating (long ago). It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I have found will also help someone who does not understand why skaters, yes, skate. Sure there is a very dark side to the whole set that the film touches a little. But it tends to focus more on what is the core of skating. Just a person on a table does it because they love to do it. This movie was so inspiring to me that I am skating again (I'm 32) and I haven't been so happy with my self this year ?? .. Give this a trip, you will not be disappointed.
