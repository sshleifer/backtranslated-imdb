This movie is almost as good as the first Jackass, but with slightly more obnoxious sketches. I didn't want to say that this was as good as first, but it came very close. Jackass fans are not disappointed, but if you did not like the first movie, you will hate it. There are scenes that will be considered as Jackass classics (the older suits with "additions", "cab ride" and many others) and those that you would like you have never seen (eat crap, drink semen, etc. ...) All in all, this movie was a good watch and I'm glad to see it. I'm sure this movie doesn't have the best rating because of critics who judge it (I was in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.
