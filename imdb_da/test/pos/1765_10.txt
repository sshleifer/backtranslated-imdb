In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced card, we see Annabelle Moore performing Loie Fuller choreographed "Serpentine Dance" in two different amazing floating clothes. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the larger stars of the late Victorian era. She was presented in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894. In fact, Loie Fuller had patented the serpentine dance that Moore performs here in clothing (as well as entire frames) which is often hand-dyed in the film, preaches one of the more common symbolic units in the quiet era. Probably the Moore films were popular enough to be often redone (including refilming). The version available to us now may be a newer version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would be naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City. She later went on to star as "Gibson Bathing Girl" in Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. The short is remarkable for its framing of movement, which, especially during the "second half", becomes almost abstract. It is similar to a Morris Louis painting, although it is almost 60 years before Louis' relevant work. You should be able to find this card on DVD in a variety of early anthologies.
