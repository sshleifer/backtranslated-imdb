As an explanation, Disney's "The Kid" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we have is a comfortable enough, but incredible, feel good family comedy that only the people of Disney can offer. <br /> <br /> In a speed change, Bruce Willis plays a self-centered, full-fledged "image consultant" shirt. He not only breaks down his clients, but also those who are close to him. You know he needs to change before the final credits. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old, played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to address his past and well .. you know the rest. As Willis' love, he is interested in Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant. Both have enough rings to do, as most of the film involves inter-action between the Willis and the Breslin characters. <br /> <br /> "The Kid" but not the biggest of Disney movies is one, but you can sit down and watch with your family and get away with a warm feeling.
