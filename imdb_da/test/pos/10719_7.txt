I've seen this movie on 3 different occasions. At first, I was overwhelmed by this movie. It appeared as a very kind movie to me. I hated this movie as a sentimental garbage on my second view. But my third view repeated my belief that it is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this movie, especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr Kramer and Mrs Kramer. There are some scenes where Meryl Streep looks like a cruel person despite being a real-life beauty. Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero who is unable to address the latest task with his child's custody. There was even a controversy on the sets of this movie. According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros, there was a shot in which he fled by being injured as Mr.Kramer's character, to show the intensity of his anger, deciding to break a glass hard. Nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. It also tells how getting mily to be maintained if there are children involved.
