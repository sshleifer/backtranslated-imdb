`Shadow Magic 'regains the joy and amazement of the first film audiences. It also shows the film's power in its ability to bring the world a little closer, overcome cultural barriers, and preserve ourselves for generations that have yet to come. Certainly, anyone who truly loves the art of art will enjoy this movie. It is a great first effort by author / director Ann Hu, who hopefully will have many movies to follow.
