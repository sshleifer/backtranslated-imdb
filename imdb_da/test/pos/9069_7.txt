Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the title place. The reason is that a new government agent is being tracked by Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man's contact was killed by one of Lorre's agents, the G-man is sent to jail for the murder, even though everyone knows there is more to the story. Lorre has the man paroleed into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he does not speak and a willpower is set in motion. <br /> <br /> This is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a lot of sense plot wise, yet the movie has your interest. I had put the film on last night to use it as something to slip off, instead I found the story easier enough, I was up for an extra 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason why you fall into this. His justice is unpleasant. He does very little, but it is clear from his orders and the way everyone responds to him (see how they light their cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> See if you should run over it.
