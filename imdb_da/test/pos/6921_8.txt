tell what it was excellent. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine, since your partner is also not bad, both are good at watching a really fun movie. True, not all gags come out, but it's worth sticking around for those who do, but come on, it has Micheal Caine in a dress in it (worth the entire fee) and every time Dylan Moran is on the screen, the more like Bernard black film. The story is two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by performing different personas to fool them all, but getting away with it is another question. basically the "actors" is a great British comedy that somehow was missed by many, seriously, if your Moran fan (or will see Micheal Caine in a dress) surely see this
