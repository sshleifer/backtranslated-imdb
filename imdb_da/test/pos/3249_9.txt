Two hands restored my belief in Aussie movies. It took an old premise and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie to no end. I recommend it to the people who like Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was amazing and almost perfect in a role tailored to him. Ledger was skillfully stupid and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.
