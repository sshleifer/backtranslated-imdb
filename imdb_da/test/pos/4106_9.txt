I went to the cinema in 1973 when the movie was released, I was 11 at the time. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to stay in Shangri-la, it was so naive and young I was. I recently came to a video of the movie I had been recording on television some years ago. I saw it again and am not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it as much as I did 29 years ago. I also enjoy listening to the words of the song because it makes me believe that one day we could live in a place where the sound of weapons does not pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection - we should be happy with what we see. This I call a "good" movie because I feel happy after seeing it. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy, and I'm sure it'll make you happy if you see it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is - a good, family movie. I have to be one of the few people who have this movie on VHS PAL video and DVD (self-made). I recorded it on DVD, as the videotape from TV began to be thin. I still see it from time to time.
