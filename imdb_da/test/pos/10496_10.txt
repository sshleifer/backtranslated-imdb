Enigma is a computer part that shrinks Russian messages so America cannot understand them. They can only be read by the intended recipient. The Americans know that the Russians are sending a message revealing the plans of five political murders that they will perform. <br /> <br /> So they send the former defective Holbeck (Martin Sheen) to grab the scrambler and replace a fake part so they will be able to decode the message and block the murder attempts. <br /> <br /> However, as we listen to Americans executives for the spy, we find that they already have scrambles, and they want Holbeck to steal Enigma, only to convince the Russians that they are not already have it. They do not expect Holbeck to succeed. That way, the Russians who have no longer sent over with Enigma will start sending again. <br /> <br /> Enigma is in the computer in the office of Dimitri Vasilikov. Somehow, Holbeck must get access, and to do that he must find out when Vasilikov will be out. He sends in his former boyfriend Karen (Brigitte Fossey) to seduce Vasilikov so that she can browse through her papers and find out his planned moves. Karen is happy to do so when she tortured her father, a university professor, to death. Because we know it's better for Americans if Holbeck fails, the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller. We hope he can survive the odds, especially as he uses brilliant methods to beat the Russians in every turn. <br /> <br /> But what is this? Are Karen and Vasilikov in love? Will Holbeck win Karen back, or will she actually end up with Vasilikov? The romantic twist raises this spy thriller, which is already worth ten, even higher, for its originality. The printer, the direction and the actor combine to make this new and fascinating twist a convincingly realistic one. <br /> <br /> You are at the edge of your seat and grab your armchair, not just for the thrill of spy history but also the intensely beautiful romantic love story. The two themes are interwoven perfectly, right up to the end. You really want both sides to win. So who ultimately wins? You have to watch the movie and find out, you won't!
