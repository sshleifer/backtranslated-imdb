Drafted on a reserve change budget of 20 pants tops, George Lucas' legendary '77 sci-fi blockbuster "Star Wars" parody in the most contagious stupid way imaginable. Author / Instructor Ernie Fosselius provides a winning and often gut-busting mix of ridiculous sound effects, inappropriate staged action scenes, cruddy (far from special effects) (just love the cheese-scratched movie lasers, tinfoil asteroids, and household appliances ... I believe that spaceships are being swung around on obvious wires), badly called in dialogue, shamelessly hammy acting and Richard Wagner's acclaimed piece of classical music "Valkyries Ride". The characters are presented in appropriate broad lines; My favorites are whiny wimp Fluke Starbucker, venerable Jedi knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie and hateful arch villain Darph Nader (who spits nothing but incomprehensibly gibberish). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on Tin Man from "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is a cheap vacuum cleaner. This movie true masterpiece is the casting legendary voice actor supreme Paul Frees as the narrator; Frees' delicious rich and plump histrionic tones add immensely to the considerable silly, but unparalleled, thrill of the tongue (election lines: "You will laugh! You cry! You must kiss three bucks goodbye!"). A total hoot.
