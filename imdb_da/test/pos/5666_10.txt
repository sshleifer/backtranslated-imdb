<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; The molding is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Poe's tales. Probably not a masterpiece, but it makes us aware of strong pictures, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion and a phrase that says it all: the wolves come. GIORGINO is completely forgotten now, and when it was released, nobody seemed to appreciate it. It's a shame. If you ever have a chance to see this, give it a try.
