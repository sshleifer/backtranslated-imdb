Unlike the many who have posted here, I am not a film literature. I stumbled upon this movie by accident (channel surfing) and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the critics have, and they on this site have heaped on it. The actors are amazing. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiance Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help feeling Boris's father's exhaustion and grief as he burned his son to such stupidity as volunteering to serve in the Great War. Others have summed up the movie so well, so I just want to mention a few scenes that moved me the most. When Boris's brother reveals to his family that he has broken confidence with his brother and "to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows disgust at this betrayal (although her part in adultery may have been through rape). You are afraid that the rest of the movie might do this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother, or worse, Tatiana shows ruined by an immoral descent in cigarette-burning decadence. Since this is not a "French existential cinema", the latter does not happen. Fortunately! <br /> <br /> Another scene that tears your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier rescued by Boris returns to tell Boris the father of his son's death. He accidentally breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the grief of sorrow ... Still, Tatiana finds a straw to grab and hopes that Boris will come home again. The musician has never actually seen Boris buried. I will not mention several scenes, but would like to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness did not detract from the film at all. Boris's brother is revealed as a piano player anti-Soviet slacker that anyone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would be. Without a doubt he gets a "teeth" at the end of the movie! The end, when Tatiana finally learns that Boris is dead, still manages to endure happily and full of hope for the future. You do not even want to think of tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, then first this movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see it.
