I remember when skateboarding had its rebirth in the 70s. I asked my parents for money for a used skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both totally impressed and totally afraid of the Dogtown crew. Skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it uses a table for transport or just has a bunch of friends skating. <br /> <br /> This movie is a brilliant documentary from the real birth of modern skating. Looking at this crew skating from the flat boring hobby, it was in the vertical lifestyle it has become if I sit slack for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that there are still enough pictures from this period to make this movie and thank God for it. The recordings are brilliant. It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton movie: I've seen some of the good tricks Keaton has repeated countless times in other movies since then, but when you go back and see the first person perform the trick It is amazing, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seemingly effortless. That's the feeling this movie gave me. Yes, I've seen people skate pools before, but to see the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that gradually became the reason for modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window. It is absolutely glorious to see something that has never before been tried before, but has since been tried by almost everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. This is a movie that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their boyfriends sit through this movie after heavy protests, and they all said their girlfriends were fascinated at the end of the movie and loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> With regard to the previous comments on this forum that complain that the film is too self-congratulating, I think it is an unfair disparagement. I liked watching these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influences their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to pat themselves on the back. They were stars to do what they loved to do. Most of these guys have never achieved the astonishing success that Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then. Sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do and, as we see last, almost everyone is still surfing, skate or working in the surf / skate industry . How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have succeeded in breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. My hat is out for Dogtown and Z-Boys to be themselves and change the world of skateboarding forever.
