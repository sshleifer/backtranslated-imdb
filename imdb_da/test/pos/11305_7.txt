My 5 year old daughter is very much into the Barbie series of movies. I have had mixed feelings about it - not having her buy into the whole Barbie doll picture of things and recognize that the movies are a marketing grip to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. This morning she asked me to watch this movie with her, and it was a lazy Saturday morning and with nothing else to do - I agreed. I don't know if the movies are made to help market the puppets, who apparently lose their appeal slightly from what I've heard or if the puppets are there to market the movies (or more likely a bit of both), but I have to admit - something to my surprise, it wasn't half bad. It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) Essentially, Annika ("the game" of Barbie) must find a way to build a "candlelight" to turn the evil star Wenlock, which among other things has turned his sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone. The animation here was pretty good - not the Disney caliber (if you think of Disney as the standard to strive for) but generally pretty good, and while the movie is of course tailored for young girls rather than middle-aged men, I still found enough twists And I am about to make me wonder how it all will turn out. It is true that there were some gaps in history, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again one must remember the target audience, who would not really think of such things. This is a very decent family movie. 10.7
