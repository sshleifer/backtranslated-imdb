Follow up to the 1965 "My Name Is Barbra" and shot in brilliant color, "Color Me Barbra" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, itchy comedy, feminine romantic anxiety and confusing seriousness for a crazy quilt-time show-biz razzle aperture. She is a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and a riddle. With her Egyptian eye makeup and ever-changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, although a few of her songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as exciting as the museum tour (with Barbra's incident being the pictures in the paintings, an idea that works better than you might think). The circus medley (built around songs with the word "face"!) Is beautifully sweet without ever enchanting. Nevertheless, this is a lively jazzy special - not quite as emotionally tantalizing as "My Name Is Barbra", but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.
