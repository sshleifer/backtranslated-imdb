'Doppleranger' (or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more known) was written (with input from late Donald James) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their Supermarionation TV show as "Thunderbirds". <br /> <br /> The international rumbureau Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet across the sun and suggests a manned flight be sent there. The committee bends at the inconvenient price and commends the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fears that the Russians might come there first, the project gets the green light. American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) is with British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After the weeks of cruel training Phoenix goes out and goes to the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, their ship goes down into what appears to be a gloomy, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly hurt. A light is seen in the direction of them ... <br /> <br /> I want to leave synopsis here. Until that time, the film has been poignant, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray (why it is not issued on C.D. is a mystery). But when Ross and Kane collide land and we discover the secret of the alien world - it's a separate duplicate, everyone is the same, the only big difference is that things are turned around - it gets less interesting and ends with a splitting anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to make this idea, actually Gerry & Sylvia later made something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks (and eventually loses) his life in an attempt to return to earth - his land. But why? The new earth is so resembled that he might not have bothered it. <br /> <br /> Recently, Roy Thinnes made 'The Invaders' TV series and gives a competent performance (sorry that there were no more scenes like the one where he reaches his wife). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but disappears from the story prematurely. Several actors continued to appear in Anderson's 'U.F.O.' like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ('The Brigadier' ​​from 'Dr.Who' in a small role). But the actress goes to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Web is such an incredible sign, he is great to see. Herbert Lom's contribution (like a spy with a camera hidden in a fake eye) is slightly more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, just like the sets. So the movie is worth watching, but don't expect much to happen when the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script this could have been another 'Planet of the Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'. <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, a fairytale playground where science was cool, everyone had swung cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people still see "Coronation Street" every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, you hope it is a better place than this. If all the women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
