I voted only excellent because this movie took two snapshots of the Americana in 1970 and one every year afterwards. <br /> <br /> Nothing really changed. Joe is actually a dunk, a big silly slob who is angry at everyone else in the world for his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the movie is the big, corporate "never crazy" guy who makes friends with this semi-troglodyte Joe and he gets some kind of ... validation from his bigotry and stupidity and feeling of get hurt. <br /> <br /> But would only argue that negotiator boyfriend deserved to die. And they shouldn't have beaten Joe and Compton away. And Joe and Compton actually got into the hock and the young skin until they were ripped off. A simple movie in many ways, except that in 1970, New York City was a match zone thanks to Nixon's care and all the money for the Vietnam War. When writing this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on Netflix for this movie - which makes me happy because I think there are people out there who want to learn. This was a pretty good snapshot - not exactly, a little caricature - but actually quite close to what it was then. And the scary thing is - things haven't changed that much. Sure there is no more welfare, but it just means that slavery has won out. <br /> <br /> Great how millionaires will complain about not making enough money so complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.
