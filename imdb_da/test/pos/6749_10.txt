This is an excellent B-movie horror movie that borders on horror and comedy. It's about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. Could it be more unreal? It's a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre." The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes who interact beautifully. Director Martin Munthe does a good job of finding the comical highlights of this script and gets a couple of good laughs out of the audience. The movie was shot with little or no money, and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a B-movie horror movie. It is comical and scary at the same time, and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of movie.
