This is the question that astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of Earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama, published here in America as JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SOL. The film was conceived by British authors Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of such television shows as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is sometimes very strange, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Derek Meddings' visual effects, which would also later work on the SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, remain surprisingly good over the last three decades of special effects progress; And while they are not really at the same high level in the Kubrick movie, they are very amazing. If you don't foresee a STAR WARS type of movie and can overcome the occasional trite dialogue, DUPLICKS is a good movie; It was good enough for me to rate it a '7' and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.
