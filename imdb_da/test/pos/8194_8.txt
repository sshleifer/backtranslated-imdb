For a feature film, the plot follows the story - or at least historical gossip. But then, the Chinese who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed over and over again, will never tolerate it otherwise. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read Sima Qian's History Records account. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, actually made an attempt at Qin Shi Huang's life at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before joining. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both the general fan leader and the dagger rolled up on the card, as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column. Although Jing Ke is described as no stranger to swords, he is hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is actually the movie's weakest link. In fact (again, according to Sima Qian) he was a heavy drinker and made his visit to Qin for as long as possible and ate a lot of time with the ladies in Yan before the Crown Prince finally ordered him on the way. In short, he was a human being and did not look to death, even though he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke is afraid of death, but not his own. He is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps just devotion) for a woman and pity for hundreds of children Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed Qin Shi Huang did this, even though there is a legend about him burying 460 Confucius to the throat and then protect them) is enough to kill this former assassination. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just boring. The action here is not shabby, but not very interesting given the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I've heard about Qin Shi Huang, she's never come up. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough for Americans to have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there should be a love interest, so here she is. It is unfortunate that her performance is almost like wood as Jing Ke's character. She has done much better (in Qiu Ju for example) by being subtle; here she hardly controls. But all this is trivial to the extraordinary performance of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese rather what Milton's Satan is for us: accepted as a villain, but a noble one. Qin Shi Huang's performance exudes an awe all over two thousand years of the present, and Li captures his frightening will without compromising on his humanity. Li's performance is enough, but the scope of the movie is magnificent, even though the photography is intentional. It feels old. The result is appropriate, hardly moving even though it is very appropriate for the action. Even though I've only seen it once, I think Chen Kaige should get more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. The opening credits are exciting. If five stars is absolutely average, I gave three more to Li Xuejian's acting and Chen Kaige as an actor, author and director.
