Can't believe it .... after all these years it's finally tracked down. It was supposed to be named 'The Great Pretender' at the production stage. I lived in Oz on time and through a friend was looking for one of the house's places by filming .... It was me who showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time I only understand that one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure whether it ever went on the screen when I left Oz the following month after the wrap up party. At that time, Russell Crowe was not the required actor he is now, and I had no idea that it was him until I saw the previous comment, then thought back to the days of recording ..... fantastic ... Really happy for myself now! !!
