This short movie certainly does not pull any strokes. The story is a butcher who mistakenly kills an innocent man whom he believes has sexually infected his late daughter. The film is about portraying how the butcher earns his time and returns to life with his daughter in care, and that one must come to a life without a future. <br /> <br /> The graphic opening scene of a horse is slaughtered and the full birth of the butcher's daughter sets you a brutal mindset that stays with you throughout the movie. The snappy flow of the movie is very direct and adds to its brutality. Therefore, much soil is covered for 40 minutes. You are fully taken with the slaughterer's treasure - especially after losing his daughter for social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
