Finally! Third time lucky. This movie has always been on my mind but my first impression I forgot it and only caught the other half of the movie. So only a few months later I had my second chance to see it, so I decided I would register it. Only to find that my hours went out again and again, I missed the first half of the girl. I wouldn't allow it to happen again. So when it came on TV again, I thought I would wait until it came on, so I will record it. And that was a good choice. I'd just seen the movie, but they always put on weekends around midnight. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in their overcrowded cell, nine escape prisoners escaping their incarceration to trace the key of the universe, as a prisoner known as the fake king, said he had hidden. They think this key could be an opening for a hidden mass of counterfeit bills. Of course, on this journey they see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. Though things do not show the way they intended, with most of the criminal plans going astray. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who cast it viewers in a movie with two completely different halves. The first half of the story unfolds more like a mental comedy with the criminals and the situations they find themselves to be the selling point, but all that makes room for a moralistic and consequential drama half, where the real problems begin with some rather unpleasant and Bloody moments replace the goofball tone it started with. While the first half is very entertaining with its on the road, scrub-doodle and unwanted booties. But it is really the real joking last half with the peculiar event that hit you so hard with some surprising hand that makes you really sympathetic to these very human characters. Although they are not really innocent of their crimes, you are simply rooted in these burnt-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiraling in their downfall, you know it's an effective drama when you get scared in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough time to understand their personal history and what weakness will ultimately bring them down. The way the plot works is that Michiru and Torakichi are the protagonists, and we see it most from their perspectives. Escapism's narrative is a undoubtedly engaging character study, evident in its goal and raises many questions about society and the path you choose to take to avoid life and free yourself from these limitations. <br /> <br /> While symbolic history is full of clarity and vivid narration. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels into the unique atmosphere. What contributed greatly to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweeping, moody-instrumental rock soundtrack. The gentle atmospheric gel that was able to create in many scenes left me quite breathless with the eternal feelings it was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and accurate strong control on that front. The pacing for such a long film (2 hours) seems to breeze, and editing is quick because we are just so wrapped up on the whole. The hypnotic photography is sharp in detail. While the casting performance as an unhappy bunch of criminals, it is of high quality with each one providing sufficient personality and functions to separate themselves. <br /> <br /> I found "9 Souls" to be a comfortable and quite surrealistic movie that excites the emotions, and then you taste yourself with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
