I would assume that this movie would get rave reviews in Canada - especially in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest we have to them is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan then they are the biggest and winning team in history. If you are not a fan then they are Satan's team !! Well, it was like that, as I grew up in Washington, DC, compared to the Dallas Cowboys. So I am quite sure when this film was shown northward, that everyone immediately had a strong emotional response - their national sport and the closest they have to a national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the comic book itself is moderately interesting when it begins, and the protagonist talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians and Maurice "The Rocket" Richard. But when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leaf jersey and forces him to wear it, I immediately knew what a horrible and shameful thing it would be for a little boy. This ability to connect the character - even if he lives in a distant country - is what made this a very special short film. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a nice nostalgic movie. Very clever and memorable.
