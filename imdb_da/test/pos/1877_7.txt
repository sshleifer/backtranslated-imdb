Or if you have seen the "Evil Dead" trilogy and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep" then you should know that his films are total farce. With "Man with screaming brain" he goes out again. In this case, he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole, who visits Bulgaria - when will we ever see that country? - when a woman kills him Then the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent who leaves him acting as Steve Martin in "All Me". Yes, the whole movie is basically an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from "Evil Dead" director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's almost brain-dead assistant Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and Skipper. <br /> <br /> Just understand that this is a completely silly movie and you will not be disappointed. I liked it anyway.
