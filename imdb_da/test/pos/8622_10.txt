I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a good job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn't look like John at 100%, but he favored him from a distance. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He didn't have John's charisma, but he certainly has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a good smile. He reminds me of my girlfriend a lot. Mrs. Bissett was just about to breathe for me. She should have asthma checked out. I don't want to comment on the Darryl Hannah character. My mother always said, "If you can't say anything good, shut up hell!" So that's what I want to do. <br /> <br /> Molly
