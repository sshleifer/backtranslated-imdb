I liked this Columbo movie, its atmosphere, which was real thriller like, and its approach even at times reminded me of movie noir, in the movie the first 30 minutes or so. It is really nice and done in a good old fashioned way with the right camera angles and use of light. It doesn't immediately mean that this movie is brilliant, but even though it is solid enough to regard this as a good, late Columbo movie post. It is definitely a better movie than the average 'later' Columbo movie entry. 26 years after his former Columbo movie appearance, George Hamilton returns to play the lead role opposite Peter Falk, again as the killer, in a completely different and new role of course. I liked him in his role and he was a good Columbo 'villain' who gave the good old lieutenant a good competition. They had some nice sequences together. Problems with the 'modern' new Columbo films have always been that it did not have a good known actor versus Peter Falk. This film obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I have to say that this film does not contain Peter Falk in the best. He has probably played the character better, and his performance is not quite consistent in this movie, which is probably also due to his film, its director Daryl Duke, who also directed the really terrible movie "Tai-Pan" among many other projects. <br /> <br /> It has a pretty good and enjoyable story, but the fact that the same kind of plot to cover the murder had previously been used in a former Columbo movie does not help, of course. It was used before in the 1975 film "Columbo: Playback". Nevertheless, of course, it probably has enough "original" moments with its story, although of course every single Columbo movie is more or less the same. But that was what made the Columbo series so large and consistent. If it is not the ink, do not correct it. It is also true that within this movie there are more tracks than usually left to lieutenant, which does not mean that the movie is the murderer more stupid or sloppy, but I see it more as the authors are more overly enthusiastic than others. It doesn't make the movie or story bad, and it can actually even make it more comfortable to see Columbo hard at work and discover all kinds of small but important tracks. Fortunately, the film is also filled with an enjoyable, effective soothing Columbo comedy. <br /> <br /> Just a good late Columbo movie post. <br /> <br /> 7/10
