Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action thrill movie. I'm not particularly fond of his, but I have to give him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is one more example. It didn't hurt to have John Malkovich as his co-star either. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to see thanks to his various disguise and the amazing dialogue he got. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is pretty low-key (for her), but that's fine, and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors, but eventually shows them all. I probably couldn't stop playing the characters "Dirty Harry", but he played them well. <br /> <br /> There were some negatives this movie, namely: Credibility in parts, as there were a couple of times, if this had been in reality, the killer would have done away with Eastwood. The climatic scene in particular had too many holes in it. There were too many violations of the Lord's name in vain in this. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, it is a good escapist fare.
