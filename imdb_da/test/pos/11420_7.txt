Critics and audiences both largely panned this movie, but I actually didn't think it was too bad! Even the critics I usually agree with thought it was scary, and I usually despise PG-13 "horror movie". So that means one of two things: either (1) I'm too satisfied, and my taste in movies has fallen over the years, or (2) 'when a foreign call' is not as horrible as it is made to be. To be fair, some of the critics of the film are true - there is not much character development, and not much in history. But man lives people, how much did you expect from a movie that a babysitter was stalked? Cut them a little limp! As a former babysitter who saw this flick late at night with the lights out, I can safely say that Stalker dude was a creepy mofo! Who knows? Yes, I admit I had fun watching this, and I don't care how big a minority puts me in.;)
