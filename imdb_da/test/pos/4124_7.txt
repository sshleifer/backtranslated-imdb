First, I'm a big Buddy Holly fan. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about the fateful flight that turned off three incredibly bright flames just like that. But I had never really listened to his music. I had heard a lot of it, yes, but not until I sat down with the purpose of getting something out of it, I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is another now because of him. Because of this worship for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without seeing it before. I'm torn on my views of this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive to me that I just couldn't bear to see Gary Busey in that role. I admit he did a good job, but his song was then forced. It seemed to me that he knew he didn't sound like Buddy himself and therefore spent too much energy trying to make a similar sound. In some parts of the film he succeeded. But others .. ouch. The movie spanned a period of several years, but I feel that the portrayal of this time could have been handled much better. I had a difficult time distinguishing what time in Buddy's life some events occurred. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the picture of Crickets. I understand how their real names could not be used and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie. And that was perhaps a good thing. Because the movie's background song was sharp and I didn't like the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to Buddy's career. Something else that really made no difference to the movie, but I was reminded of Gary Busey's teeth. They worn me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed it ... but I did. <br /> <br /> I want to finish this review on what I felt was the best part of the movie: Buddy's last performance. His final phone call to Maria, Big Bopper's performance, brings him and Richie Valens to the scene, followed by the ever-ending frame that ends. It scared myself, and I feel it effectively shows the audience how Buddy Holly was so vivid and energetic for a moment and that his flame was sniffing out in flashing eyes. It was a beautiful way to portray this terrible tragedy I believe. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. <br/> <br /> Some obvious mistakes, could use some work ... but not bad.
