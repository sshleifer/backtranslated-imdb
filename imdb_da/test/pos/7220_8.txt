I don't think the world was ready for this movie. I know I wasn't. I was expecting a standard low budget schlock utilization pot boiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent rework of Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books". This was supposed to be the final movie version of Romeo and Juliet. Of course it won't. But it's the world's loss.
