This late 50-year-old French study of uninhibited youth (in the early 20s, actually - "grown up" but not yet settled in the adult world) probably missed the field with a kilometer compared to being a precise depiction of French Young people in 1958 (not nearly all ALL youth films made by adults do this? Those who do not - River's Edge come to mind - are rare), but also the author Marcel Carne of Les Enfants du Paradis fame is also an exact observer of humanity to NOT give an insight into the essence of these characters. In a way, the details are not important - you could change the details and put this movie today and it would work just as well - but loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters are well received. Young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo support roles, but lead Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit, and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a nice jazz score that you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who have commented on the movie, I don't really see director-writer Carne as sitting in the judgment on these characters - he seems to be an objective observer to me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are pampered and have nothing to chew on to some work-class viewers of the movie, and I think Carne is certainly aware of it. For this American viewer (I saw a dubbed, quite literally I want to say, version of this designation THE CHEATERS), the film provides an interesting window in France in the 1950s. It's also self-consciously poetic (the scene on the edge, rescue of the cat, is just an example of this) and has intellectual ambitions in the charming way that only French movies can get away with - I can imagine the heavy hand, melodramatic, shallow way, this kind of material would have been handled by an American studio production and the sensationalist, moralistic, suggestive way that this kind of material would have been handled by American drive-in / exploitation filmmakers. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between, says high school, and when in the early 30's, practically a routine has been, no matter what routine it may be. Those who are willing to watch the film with an open mind and not turn off the many easy goals it provides should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you don't want to, you can go into the other room while the movie is playing and just enjoy the fine soundtrack of the great 50's jazz and instrumental pop, including the amazing original score of an American "Jazz at Philharmonic" group including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled "goetz" in the credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
