If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, chances are that you also like it here. Although I assume that some of the British in-jokes (like calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal football players) may be lost on some, it is still cracking entertainment that veritably pumps with vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all good, giving depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two main characters is always well-known. In fact, Scott's direction is very much assured given that this is his first feature film and shows that he has his father's talent to put us in peace in unfamiliar surroundings. Hell, I've convinced myself. I'll see it again!
