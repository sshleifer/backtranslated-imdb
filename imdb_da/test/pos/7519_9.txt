If you liked Paddy Chayevsky's "Network" you will probably also like this black comedy, as it is another brilliant Chayevsky script, a wonderful satire in metropolitan hospitals and a perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays a widespread medical boss on the most chaotic day he or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis comes to mind, and his hospital falls around him, as the locals demonstrate against the hospital, and patients and doctors die alarmingly thanks to a biblically inspired and murderous saboteur. The latter, who theaterly declares himself "Fool for Christ", "Parakleet of Kaborka", "The Wrath of the Lamb" and "The Inhabitant Englishman" bend doctors on the head, administer lethal injections and switch patients' identities, causing treatments and operations, performed on the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable as deadly mistakes like these happen (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time you get laugh at the priceless character portraits. One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a kind of well-known surgeon who spends much longer worrying about his investments and stock quotes than on his patients who suffer from his indifference and neglect. There is Diana Rigg as the outdoor life, hippie-ish Barbara Drummond, who seduces the besieged medical chief (Scott) and tries to get him to run away with her. Then there is the fraudulent killer who happens to be Barbara's father and who "works well enough" back on the Indian reservation, where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is jostled just by being put back in civilization. The strongest portrait is by far Scotts Dr. Bock, who asks his soul as a former boy, a failed father and a man, a brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of suicide, but must carry himself under the demands of his job. Scott is unusual in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until the final scenes, you do not know if Bock will leave the hospital behind Barbara's Indian reservations and a quieter and simpler life, whether her murderous father will be caught or whether the protesting, harassing locals will take over and bring the hospital on his knees. Looking at the crooked murderer at work is a suspicion that Chayevsky tells us that our lunatic society causes him to do these things, as we are told he is another person away from cities and people. As my own father was the chief administrator of a number of large hospitals over the years, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his job and the great responsibility he should have. This story makes it the responsibility of the imbalance that Scott's crisis turns around. This is both a fun and scary movie, with the actors up to the big demands of Chayevsky's script. It's also a movie I get more out of every time I see it.
