I could see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free sneak preview. I absolutely LOVED the movie! I was drawn on it because of the realistic depiction of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann. I think there are talks about the excellent performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I couldn't think of another actress in the role. The Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I didn't think another teenage actress could. I think it would be a visual arts academy to give credit where it is due, and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for prizes in the "Actresses" and "Supporting Actresses" category. It would be a shame if they were overlooked.
