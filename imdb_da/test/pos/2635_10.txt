This movie is a good example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh, don't forget me, most of the music is then sucked again. I've only had the metal band from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget the whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is terrible and I will die' garbage. But the films from the 80s are the best. They were about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies it! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
