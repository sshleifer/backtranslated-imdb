During World War II, a bazillion movie was created by Hollywood, and after seeing many of them, they begin to work alike. Over 21, however, is unique in many ways, as it shows one side of the war that you will not see in other movies - making it worth seeing even if you have seen bazillion other movies! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the male management, but the real leader of the movie is Irene Dunne - who looks great for a 47-year-old lady (yes I controlled - she was really the old one when she made the movie ). In 21, the couple plays husband and wife. He arrives in the military, much to his father's grief (Charles Coburn) and the owner of the newspaper where Knox is employed, and most of the film takes place when he is in the officer's graduate school. The film shows a bit of Knox in school, but instead centers on Dunne when she lives in nearby Spartan residence for spouses. During this time, she (like the British) holds a "stiff upper lip" and makes the best of it - even though she is not really a housewife, but a famous professional writer. Occasionally, she gets very short visits from her wife husband, but most of the time is spent doing housework's tasks and keeping the disruptive Coburn in bay. Eventually she decides to stop the annoying Coburn from calling incessantly (he always complains that his paper will not survive without his son) by pretending to be Knox - writing wonderful editorials, all just assuming was written by him. <br /> <br /> While there is no earthquake in this movie, it is a very interesting piece of life's movement. In addition, the actor around is very good. Interestingly, this film is a fictionalized recast of the experienced Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and his husband, Garson Rabbit (also a famous screenwriter and director). When Rabbit joined the military during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the piece that became this movie. <br /> <br /> So I noticed that some reviewers really liked the speech to the end of the movie and were inspired by it. While it was very good, it was also very sad, as all this hope for a better world after the war was short-lived.
