One of the best shows ever made and it just gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the English adaptation made by David Weir. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in the native language was more whimsical and less flat out hilarious that the version we all know. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non-Japanese fans is due to Mr Weir's inspired efforts and some winning voice-over work. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
