I saw the 2 hour version of Choker Bali. I can't say it's far. The movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to disappear at any time. Costume and set reminders of what we would see in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai has done a great job. It is actually a mature role with enough opportunity to act in history. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys seems like the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first anniversary. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the one-time-dimmed state. <br /> <br /> Her best friend in this movie is played by Raima Sen has also been well-handled. Her innocence and her admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and act educated have been done very well. These are actually some of the prevailing thinking in these times. We can see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The movie speaks of women's emancipation as a subtle line of history. I found the evolution of history very similar to Ghare Bahire also written by Tagore. It ropes in some actions of the independence struggle and, unlike the struggle for Indian independence, sets against the silent struggle for women's rights. A suitable movie is definitely worth seeing. Aishwarya acts: par excellence. The rites have handled the story with great care. Yet another classic from Rabindranath Tagore.
