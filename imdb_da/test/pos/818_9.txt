This movie essentially contains all the elements of a large 70's movie, except that it was made in the late 80's for direct to the video market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack action or gang violence. When the girlfriend goes to jail, her boyfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are all in this movie except for the police. First, she gets confused by the crack of a dealer, and then because he owes to Mr Brown's money, she becomes Brown's property. Then she is basically slavery in a military-style house where the film is named. As if this is not enough reason to watch this movie, you also have Anthony Geary playing an apparently conservative school tutor, but he is really a big crack dealer. In a blurry but hilarious scene, he requires sexual favors from the hero because she doesn't have the money for a solution. In a previous scene, it was established that he is her advisor. The scene and another where Jim Brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks is hysterical. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good at this movie. Tarantino, take her back. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a big fan of this. It has just the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's fateful trip deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's B-crook, Wings Hauser in the Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be a b-movie Oscars where performances like this could be recognized. Meanwhile, we hope the modern direct to DVD filmmakers learn to learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.
