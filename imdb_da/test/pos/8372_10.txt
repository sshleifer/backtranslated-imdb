Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he should take some time as everyone around him relies heavily on him and confirms his own death. When he discovers those he loved, he still needs love, he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. On his own past, according to his own wishes, this amazing movie by Claude Lelouch is a man's quest for himself in a mature age. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch movies, the movie's beginning with constant flashbacks can be confusing, especially scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks pretty much like his father) plays a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence that takes a second to understand. <br /> <br /> One of Lelouch's most elaborate works, L'itineraire d'un Infant Gate, is a must-see tale of self-fulfillment.
