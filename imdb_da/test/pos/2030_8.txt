Mark Walhberg in a big role, idolizing a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection and dressing like him. When the opportunity for him to take over his "idol" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. But the role of a rock star may not be what it is blown to be ... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you achieve, maybe not what you think it is when you get it. All in all, a really good movie with amazing performances from all the cast, as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what he had sunk. If anyone ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie, they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamorous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you might want.
