So this movie and absolutely loved it, the characters are great. It's definitely my kind of movie you won't be bored with in this movie. I love independent movies, they are so much more rewarding. my husband and i really enjoyed jay style. If you are an open minded person who loves thoughtful movies and loves the conversation after it is over you will love this movie. It is certainly thought provoking.The movie will definitely step on some toes, but who cares about these people will probably not go to watch this movie. It's great to see the characters evolve. Jay Floyd has really caught both sides of the table. Applaud the applause Jay I hope you are working on another movie.
