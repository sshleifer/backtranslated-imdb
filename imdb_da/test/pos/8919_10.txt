This is really an Australian cult classic. If you are one of the lucky ones to have seen it, then you are very lucky. It has been released in most countries but not in Australia for some reason. I have a copy on DVD from the UK. Not a good transfer, but I bought it after seeing it earlier at a film festival. The management is spot on and the performance rocks! This is dark movie scary movie, but often times, very fun in parts. I urge you to watch this movie, which is a toughness about this, you can't see in 99% of the typical Aussie fare. The play is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end a lot, but until the last ten minutes you just can't pick that bad. Great work from the four drivers, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> All that is said and done: Great work on the screen!
