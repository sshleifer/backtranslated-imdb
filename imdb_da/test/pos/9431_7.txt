It is not that bad to get into the series, highly tense with war propaganda, but Rathbone & Bruce's sincerity makes me happy. It's a pretty great story from start to finish, how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty Independently) reeling out the Dancing But code uncoded so fast was Amazing Watson - so why weren't you amazed! The post explaining the bomb sight / enlargement tickled me, it was just that kind of cheap trick Universal would play - again reminding me that they don't expect people to critically see this over 60 years later. This (and I think every other pot boiler from Universal during this period) was supposed to be seen once or twice and forgotten. They might have realized that people basically do not change that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a chosen group now (2005) and tighten up the script and put it! <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill was through his Hollywood rape issues around this time, I wonder if it was that or particularly effective make-up that made him look as fragile as Moriarty? The important thing about SW, however, is that this was the first Holmes movie, Roy William Neill directed, I think he instructed the rest and produced everything, but one and thus established a fantastic surrounding continuity.
