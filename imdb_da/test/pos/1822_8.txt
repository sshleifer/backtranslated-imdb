This movie is one of my all-time favorite movies and is what made me a life long Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid 80's, I lost this movie (when the VCRs were impossible to do this with !!) and wanted to see it again and again. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And he looks wonderful and has no influence on "acting-isms" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean about it !!). I measure all his performance against this. He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with edgy friends. The music was great. The Plimsouls! The psychodical furs! Modern English! Men at work! When I hear "melt with you", I am taken back to the final of this movie. <br /> <br /> What's happened to his sweet costar, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Certainly took a different trip than Nicolas! Interestingly, the end-of-life (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being Tommy's voice from Rugrats (she's billed as E.G. Daily for that horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> To take a good trip back to the 80s, watch this movie. It is definitely a classic. Like completely!
