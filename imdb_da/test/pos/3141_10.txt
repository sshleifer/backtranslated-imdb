One of the most poetic narrative movies ever made, WAGONMASTER is nevertheless a difficult movie that immediately likes. I love this movie, but I recommend watching some of John Ford's other westerns before taking a look at this. The first time I saw it, I was 18 years old and I hadn't seen too many other westerns and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I waited for something to happen. It took me years to love this picture. First, I fell in love with westerns in general - the traditions, the signs, the landscapes, the ways of speaking, etc. - and that made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that much is happening. <br /> <br /> I was also simply a more experienced filmmaker at that time and had learned to appreciate visual narration and to listen to what each picture told me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual movie of one of the most visual of executives working close to the top of his career. <br /> <br /> The movie is a feast for a lifestyle and its subject is more emotional and interior than other Ford westerns. In fact, it is not as accurate as saying it, but it has much less external action than the other western ones. (The other westerns have external actions and inner feelings.) It places its pormets very nicely in nature. There are many shots of animals and children - not for any surface, narrative, but for illustrating this idea. Therefore, the film can be called a poem. It's not about the surface's history (which hardly exists) almost as much as it is about an emotional idea, and it gets this idea through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, one might argue that this is a cleaner form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of ​​the film, rather than first servicing a "story". <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms, not the terms of other westerns or other films.
