Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, struggle for good and evil - all with a small budget, kids actors and get special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth degree Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a distinguished building and travels 100 years ahead in the future. He discovers an almost perfect utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, all are friendly to each other, and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a unit called Mielophone that allows people to read minds and animals. The device can be used for both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil spaces pirates from Saturn, who will rule the universe's attempt to steal Mielophone, fall into the hands of 20th-century schoolgirl Nick. With the pirates warming on his tracks, he travels back to his time followed by the pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion, and fun situations follow as the unfortunate pirates try to interfere with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The prisoner is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and literally turn to someone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator ...) Who comes to Nick - and Mielophone - first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventure and fantastic soundtrack. I want Hollywood to make young movies like this ...
