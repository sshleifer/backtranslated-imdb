I just watched this movie at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day with a long shot. A school age in the prostitute meets with a Middle Ages and tries to conclude deep depression together. It is an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. History comes from real life interests, torn from the headlines. Raw, dumb dialogue and a killing twist at the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Absolutely not suitable for children. Too depressing for some people's taste. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.
