This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) Plays twins, one of whom has committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at first doesn't give you any idea who did it! Peter Falk is in shape as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favorite episode). The support molding is great especially Julie Newmar (very underestimated) and Jeanette Nolan as the housekeeper, who Columbo just stops. The surname of Martin Landau's sign in this is 'Paris'. It was the surname Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a Steven Bochco joke?
