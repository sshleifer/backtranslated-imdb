The "love letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very low key romantic comedy, in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter opens up the secret passions and longings of the sleepy villagers of a sleepy town. <Br /> <br /> It's not for all audiences. "The love letter", I feel, the benefits of it are simple and quiet tone. Never deliberately wacky and fake like most romantic comedies it is quaint, quaint and comfy. But for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and uninterested. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. And it's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw, we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom". She is naturally good here; improvement in every role I have seen her in the side lattice on Indy's nerves. And is it possible Capshaw to be just beautiful and lovelier with age? (What is it about Spielberg!?) <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean much; but after another noisy summer movie season I will probably look back with a short chaining for this light-as-a-feather romance.
