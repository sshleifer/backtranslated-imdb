Although I watched this movie about 4 years ago long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now, which is unusual for me since before I have often reviewed something right after seeing it. What can I say? Now, the best performance of late Peter Boyle as the title character, who, after finding out if a man's killed daughter's drug-trafficking girlfriend, will commit to him, even though he's a Madison Avenue leader who has nothing in common with the much lower class conservative Joe. In fact, there are lots of fun scenes from Joe at this guy's party that make smart alecky comments there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actor who plays the daughter they are looking for after disappearing from the hospital after overdosing some drugs is nothing more than Susan Sarandon who makes her movie debut! This was a pretty hardy movie for the time it was made (late 60s and early 70s) and was compelling work by scriptwriter Norman Wexler (later by Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen ( later to save Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Finally, the end packs a wallop even today after all these years! Highly recommended to anyone curious about counterculture of that time. P. S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here is a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz biscuits, a bottle of Heinz ketchup and a unique Nixon poster asking, "Do you want to buy a used car from this man?"
