As I grew up, Voyage in Space was my most favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week, and I and my sisters saw it every single day! I still remember all parts of that movie. The end was so sad when Giant Robot was blown up with Guillotine and looked at Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face and asking for Giant Robot. There should have been a sequel to the movie, where Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe there are so many other Voyage to Space fans still out there. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but my sister said they are now bootlegged out and probably poor quality copies of the movie. I don't know why they haven't released it yet, as it has been over 40 years now. I think Voyage into Space was made back in 1968. Only now is my second favorite Japanese monster movie from all the time (The War of the Gargantas) finally coming to DVD and being released September 9th and I can't wait! :) Now if they would just do the same with Voyage into Space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Voyage into Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others, it will always be a childhood classic for me! :)
