I agree that this movie was spectacular. The way Jamie Foxx caught, not only the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the movie. His life made a great story, and it is good that it is finally told. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of Ernie Manouse from InnerVIEWS at KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = inerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = da. I urge everyone to check it out as it provides in-depth insight into what went into his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I can mention with the movie is that the shotting style was rather bland at times, but eventually I think it helped make the story more realistic and focus on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the movie Ray.
