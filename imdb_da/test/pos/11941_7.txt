Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized from the cast list, so I wasn't so keen on watching this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I saw it on late night T.V. I would recommend this movie as a good late night view. It is better than much of this genre. The reason is excellent, the play is not brilliant, but it is not bad. I usually don't like flashbacks, but in this movie they work. As I mentioned, I didn't recognize any of the casting names, but I recognized Michele Lee, who gave a decent, hard work that the woman would stand by her husband lying to her. (Was it a knot landing?) At least she has a really good time. Note: You can enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. I did, and it helped me. When you see the final credits, you get what I mean The Wayne Kennedy character, which is really weird, takes it to a 7 rather than a 6.
