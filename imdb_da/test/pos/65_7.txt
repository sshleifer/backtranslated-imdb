I'm an avid Julie Andrew's fan and I've just seen this for the first time on DVD - Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction line, two strip drills actions, and war / shooting / blood for a G rating? Strange. I would rate it PG-13. <br /> <br /> Except I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful presentation of Andres voice and talent. The action was great. The story was a little weak and left holes that could have been filled with a good dialogue. There were too many "no talk, just walking" scenes for me ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock flourish so the intense love would be more credible.
