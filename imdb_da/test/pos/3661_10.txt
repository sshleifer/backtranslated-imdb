Be very lucky to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a lovely movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I would like to go there now. The most important actor ... Friday was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently, he was also in the movie. Monson wedding. He was the overall star of the show. Benoy's character blew me ... was a lot of fun. And the girl (forget the name) was also wonderful. They were all good! There were many amazing scenes like the one with the monkeys. And basically I just loved the movie. Everyone went out of it and it was definitely a highlight of the film festival. Was my favorite from the festival. It is truly beautifully captured the vibrancy of India and cannot believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of going out of the cinema was really high. It's a nice, happy movie. I loved it !!
