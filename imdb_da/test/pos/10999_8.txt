The Squire of Gothos is one of the "sillies" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor is generally driven by the stand-off between William Shatner and the epic hilarious guest star, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears into thin air and Kirk follows shortly afterwards. Spock immediately begins to look for his missing colleagues (and even though he hates to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crew members have to deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, flamboyant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a being in able to create or destroy everything he wants through his rare power. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot may be reused from past episodes (frankly there are some sci-fi shows that do not have at least one godlike character), but that feeling disappears quite quickly thanks to the manuscript's use of exaggerated humor that is all conveyed through Campbell's deliberate rental performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance - burned curiosity for mankind (his knowledge is quite limited) probably worked as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came up with the character of Q to the Next Generation pilot, about two decades after this episode is broadcast. In short, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is this: "silly" does not necessarily mean "bad".
