This movie is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a report between the audience and the characters. I think there is a sequel missing for this, Barker should have dedicated to the sequel to this movie instead of making the boring Lord of Illusions, it's one I thought was a real garbage. But I also think that NBreed because of this and because of the lack of successor has become a dark cult classic of horror movies.
