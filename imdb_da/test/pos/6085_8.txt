During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed aircraft. With his face frightened after recognition, and with the man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is believed to be an ally soldier and is simply referred to as the English patient.

After some time caring for Almásy alone , along with a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who lost his thumb during the war, and suspected that it was Almásy betraying him to the Germans, Hana also discovers a provisional romantic relationship with Kip ( Naveen Andrews, an Indian cotton diffuser in the British army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that he will be involved in Kip, will judge him to death, especially in view of his very dangerous work style. <p> In 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully reminds of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance between mystery, love, joy and tragedy. heartbreaking and carefree, but also uplifting in its own way.
