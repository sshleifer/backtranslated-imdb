There were a lot of stupid teenagers who got sex movies from the 80s and many slasher flicks, but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and caught the time to the right; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, then Forman, who from his bio unfortuatley has disappeared from the Hollywood limelight. I would like to see this published on DVD in a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. Wishing I know. Ever want to plan a real 80s movie weekend, rent this one, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. It will take you back to a "Totally Rad" time, as it seemed at that time, was much more simple. Memo for studios: Time to release the DVD!
