I feel the Niiiiiight Heat! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART beat! Something is not right! "Theme song written by BJ Cook from Skylark-David Foster's old band and wife. She also wrote the memorable theme of CBC's" Airwaves ". OH Night Heat! What program! Well written, well-acted and completely classic. Criminal looser and a good team and a hint of humor at the end. I want to believe this is really what detectives do / did. Giambone was a real favorite! On a Canadian tip, I taught every Canadian actor name and style from guest seats performed at Night Heat. Night Heat set and like Law & Order, it was the story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without many character melodrama.
