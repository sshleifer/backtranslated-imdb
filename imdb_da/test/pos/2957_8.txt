Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on the screen as the masked man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure "The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold", contributing Jay Silverheels as his loyal Indian scout Tonto. Selander was an old hand on half westerns in his 40 years in film and television with over 100 westerns for his directorial credit. This fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in his portrayal of Indians who, since 1950, had been gradually adopted in Hollywood oaters after director Delmar Daves blew the track with James Stewart Western "Broken Arrow". Racial intolerance is the primary theme of Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald's manuscript. After writing 13 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" TV series, Schaefer and Freiwald were each well acquainted with the formula, but they raised the effort for this theater performance. Our vigilante heroes run to the rescue of Indians who are murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. The mystique of the identity of these assassins and the reason behind their murderous behavior are revealed quite early so you don't have to guess what happens. Although the violence in this Selander saga looks pretty modern, the fact that Lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in a scene rather than wounds, and that a dastardly lady beats a double-crossed accomplice by throwing a tomahawk, Sinking in the back between his shoulder blades was pretty daring. The TV series never went on this length, and when Lone Ranger ran his six-gun, he shot the gun out of the crook's fist instead of blowing him away. The other disagreement here is the Indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never brought to accusation to abduct this manuals. Douglas Kennedy did not have the crooked statue of Lyle Bettger, who threatened the masked man in director Stuart Heiser's "The Lone Ranger", but he is releasing himself well as a fake ban, killing one of his own minions without a nausea. When miscreant threatens to reveal his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of avenged Indians. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold opens with a round of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambushed Texas Ranger and his conversion to the Lone Ranger with Tonto, who serves as his sidekick. This two-minute refreshment opening is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character so everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on equal footing. The primary plot of a gang of ruthless white caps and did not call surprising? Hooded Raiders begin with them killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. Lone Ranger and Tonto are too late to intervene, but they find a baby hidden nearby. With the baby and the dead Indians, they drive to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of "The Outsider") and turn the child and body over to him. Initially, Padre must assure an Indian virgin, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby") that the masked man means no harm and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto out to town to get the doctor, dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks from "Gun Fever"), and Tonto run straight into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawyer, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant"), who holds Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor treating prisoners in the sheriff's prison, and Matthison's men start tearing him up when Rolfe intervenes and drives back to the mission. <br /> <br /> Finally, Lone Ranger and Tonto can catch one of the Hooded Raiders, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara from "Drums"), and his fellows abduct the craftsmen and take him back to their village. They jump him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. Chief villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of Devil's Canyon) drive out to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured hands. Little by Brady, his hands were talking. Lone Ranger and Tonto do not arrive long after, claiming Redbird for its perfection. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died, and Lone Ranger decides to adopt a disguise so he can learn more. He masqueraded as a gentleman's bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite the short 83-minute running time, "The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold" lacks excitement or surprises. Selander keeps the action going with a full canter. The dialogue is largely expressionistic rather than memorable, as Schaefer and Freiwald push the plot more often than spring surprises, but there is a great surprise that is linked to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene where Lone Ranger pushes his own credo on justice available to everyone under the law at a time when the Chief Justice's lawyer Earl Warren had initiated the landmark landmark decisions that recognized and diminished terms of racial segregation, civil rights, segregation of church and state and police arrest procedure in the US. One thing that separates "The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale of flashbacks to the Spanish conquistadors' age with a little bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. In general, Lone Ranger limited the stories to the 19th century without drawing on European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first movie to deal with Spanish conquistadors. Robert D. Webb's "The Seven Cities of Gold" (1955) concerned the Spanish who sought southwest of the eponymous sites, but Selander's Western beat Gordon Douglas' "Gold of the Seven Saints" (1961) to the screen.
