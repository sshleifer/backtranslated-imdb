Walter Matthau is wonderful as "philandering" the dentist Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent fibs to girlfriend Goldie give textbook evidence of the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's Touch Cook Toni Simmons certainly deserved to win his Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as a stiffening nurse Stephanie also touches to see when she comes slowly and nervously out of her shell. This is a great movie to see in the spring, or some time for that matter. It is very undervalued; I have never heard of it before I found it in the video store and what a find!
