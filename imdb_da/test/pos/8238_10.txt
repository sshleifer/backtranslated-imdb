A bright, uplifting and engaging film. Seeing Irene Dunne is a pleasure! When you look at her, she ceases to be Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton in every way. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed Irene Dunne in every movie I've seen, and that would be almost all of them. What a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly. I hope the Irene Dunne movies are restored before it's too late to be such treasures. Well, that's not the case with Over 21. It's a must if you like great acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The World and Apple Pie" that was one of the many highlights of the film. I read a place where Irene Dunne helped write this talk with director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in privacy) and it seems safe to show up in her movie!
