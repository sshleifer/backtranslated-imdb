I actually found out about Favela Rising via the IMDb website. I have a particular interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and film. Favela Rising is one of the gems that give a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, the story is Anderson Sa, a former Rio De Janeiro drug dealer who, after the death of family members and friends, becomes a Christlike, Malcolm X and Ghandi, rolled into one. Then AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement using afro-Brazilian hip hop, formed capoeira (afro-brazilian martial arts) drum and other art forms to transform the hopeless and most often angry youth into living, viable, caringly beloved individuals. <Br /> <br /> Some years ago I remember going to a screening of the City of God (Cidade De Deus) and went out of the theater completely numb. The pictures were grim yet amazing and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. I remember how hopeless some situations were in Favelas and how decadent the society was due to governments' neglect. How drug trafficking was a way of life, no matter how stupid citizens were, because death was a daily occurrence. Like City Of God Anderson Sa tells how the people of favelas were also desensitized. He talks about police corruption and how communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you couldn't visit family members of other Favelas you might encounter in a neutral place. Unlike God's City, Anderson Sa's grassroots movement AfroReggae provides solutions to anger, hopelessness. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the documentary where Anderson, in a preaching spirit, approached some young people and asked them to join AfroReggae. These jaded youths were so scared of everyday survival and violence. Their role models were drug dealers, and that was what they wanted to be. Anderson then told us that drug dealers did not live very long. There was, of course, reluctance, but five months later he could get some of the youth to participate in AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The pictures in Favela Rising are beyond fantastic. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only good storytellers but also artists. This is a must see documentary! There are some really magical and transforming moments in this documentary. I don't want to spoil them for you. I want you to see it yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this wonderful movie. It will interest you in the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give it eleven stars!
