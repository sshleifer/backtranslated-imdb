SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons and I've seen every single episode that had ever come out. I have to admit that season 1 is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he has to go to school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he has to. He spells a word that repents Homer and he chases Bart around the house. The next day, Mrs Krabappel appeals to the class that the test is not part of their class, just a test that would tell them how their future would be. Bart can't answer a question. He believes fast. He quickly changes test with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day, Marge and Homer are called to head office headquarters to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly the school psychologist comes out of nowhere and tells Skinner and Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and had to go to a special school for the gifted. Bart goes in to go as he doesn't have to do homework. The next day, Homer Bart runs to the new school. He is introduced to everyone and everyone. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. The smart students take their lunch smartly, he cannot read any comics, but he does, and he is criticized by his fellow students. Fortunately for Bart, he and Homer start having a good time together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to the opera and make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school, but becomes fun by his friends. They call him a pointexter. While at his new school, he is asked to do a chemistry experiment. He does it wrong and blows up the school and leaves it green. Bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells that he will go undercover and go back to his old school to observe other children. The psychologist is fascinated and he asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds it too difficult and instead writes a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that he misspelled the word preaching. That night, the homer baths Bart and Bart say that he really is not a genius and that he cheated on the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart around the house, as Lisa and Marge look at them randomly. <br /> All in all, this is a very underestimated season an episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
