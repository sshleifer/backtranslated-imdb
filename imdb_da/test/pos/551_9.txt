Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play each other as a symphony in this upcoming age story of a young girl who is sentenced to life as a daughter of one of the nicest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability, calling it talent if you want to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to the forefront of any movie she's making. As the mother of this, of course, brilliant and mutated beyond her annual young girl, Sarandon alternates between being a mother and being the child with a ballet dancer's ease. More importantly, she does it with strength and flare without bumping over Portman's portrayal of her daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot that is changing? This movie is definitely about the daughter, but if you look close to the dreams and the victims that mom makes you understand that she is changing with her daughter. I'm willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change too. Characterized by fine drama
