The reason is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job quite well. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things don't make a lot of sense (eg the first "hunting" scene, why would the heroine not just hide a place and wait for the evil ones to leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models that span 50 years, and then the place seems strange out of time. Overall, you will probably also like this if you like thrillers.
