Strangely enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are funny. This is fun. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to show naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They were told that cartoons are not just for children. The art of this is probably the best non-Road Runner art from the 1950s Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across anything better than the art of "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", though nothing ever will. This likelihood runs close to 3rd or 2nd shorts like this could have created white LT rip-offs like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to squeeze out the old comedy again and again, as how good movies like Scream evoked crap as I by ... who was released just to squeeze out all the old scream from Scream, but like Scream, it's good alone. Chuck Jones has had his mistakes with shorts once in a while, but he makes up for them. Take e.g. Hopper. Few people like Hopper, but it never ruined LT's reputation, but I'm sure this was his make up on things as such. Bottom line: This is not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But close. Capture it on Cartoon Network often.
