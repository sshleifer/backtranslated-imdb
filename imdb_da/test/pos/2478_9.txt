Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutally twisted, uncompromising political weapon across an infinite desert cabinet. An inappropriate left-leaning anti-authoritarian abuse party seems to the escapades first to be so over the top militaristic and disease that it could come out as a far-off amazingly stunning dystopian alternative story, a Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But when we delve deeper and really watch the abominable diatribe spitting out those who preside over the tent-covered tribunal as well as shotgun toting guards watch the bloody affair, our eyes are really opened. We suddenly discover how the prescient Watkins film production is, so much of this is the kind of neo-con talking about youth culture and the legality of the divergent thought chosen by politicians today. Encouraged, much of it was also drifting well, but it really shows us how little has changed and informs how we are in some ways closer to such a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and scary operation. <br /> <br /> The most important players in almost every scene are spicy non-actors who are mostly chosen for their rash political views and want to get them on camera. This gives an unprecedented truthfulness to the whole experience, as we never, even for a second, question the reality of all chaos. Shot documentary style with 16mm film, it looks like a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that was classified until found years later. At least, it seems to have that story for it now, perhaps not so much, as it (barely) was released. But it gives extra weight to all procedures and helps pull you into this incredible, not-so-alternative torture universe for condemned dissidents.
