Most people participating in this movie have no idea of ​​Arthur Miller's great novel that is the basis of it. It is a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudices affect and change people's lives. In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses his boss makes him change everything he has worked for, and his whole world collapses about him, gradually. There couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented stage and actor, but he works honestly behind any character he plays. He is a daily man caught in his own uncertainties. His anxiety intensifies as he takes a position and leaves his job. Suddenly he has to face the problems he has been trying to avoid all his middle-class existence in Brooklyn in the 40s. Is he Jewish, isn't he? The cinematography of this brilliant and atmospheric film, ruled by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some Edward Hopper's paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the movie, when Newman went outside a building and night shot when he and his wife is followed by long, black shadows behind the couple, threatening and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially the Meat Loaf, which infuses incredible depths into the bully's next door, is excellent, but they are all pale in comparison to William H. Macy's star shift. H must stand for HONEST ..) If you haven't read the book, I sincerely recommend it because no one has written more real and convincing than Arthur Miller has.
