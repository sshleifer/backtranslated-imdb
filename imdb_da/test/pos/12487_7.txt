The unusually adorable Suzy Delair plays a statuesque obsessed with succeeding in the theater. Her husband and accompanist, played by Bernard Blier, is a complex but jealous man. Finding out a less-than-preferred way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman for the purpose of promoting his career, he loses control and threatens the businessman with murder. Now I must finally stop describing the movie for you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists, revelations, ambiguities, and tensions that suppose some of it would threaten it. I'm not sure how good or bad it is for this French police force coming from the song-and-dance community, though it is certainly interesting that what we know all the way is who did not . We just don't know who did. The story depends on the procedure with the following traces, where ideal alibis fail and how gently created fabrications and fraud disintegrate. Interestingly, it is a tension film where tension is created despite the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too early. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is the smallest dark of Henri-Georges Clouzot's film. It is nowhere as scary as the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the hesitant Pay of Fear or as annoying as Le Corbeau. Perhaps this is due to the vibrations of the dance halls and theater settings of the 1940s France, which all seem to be the environment for this criminal player. <br /> <br /> Clouzot both understands and accepts his characters, the more rotting they have, where he has more of a revenge streak with his other films. Where he may have understood the shameful women of Les Diabolique or the lorry drivers who are sinking to the risk of the terrible death of being deprived of miserable life in the Fear of Fear, there is not necessarily support or agreement on part of the filmmaker, for These are signs that clearly made the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this more sedentary film have scenes and moments that hit us to them, even the hard, cold detective played by Louis Jouvet who cares about his young adoptive son in the midst of all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with a drop of a hat. There is humor and indescribable sexiness, the latter mostly in Delair, which neutralizes the pressure to a degree. Clouzot worked quietly with his craft, patiently until he made his relentless later films, where he would not allow his audience to escape the excitement.
