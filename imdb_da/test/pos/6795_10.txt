After my 6-year-old daughter started riding lessons, I started looking for horse movies for her. I had always heard of the National Velvet, but had never seen it. Boy am I glad I bought it! It has become my favorite, my 6 year old and my 2 year old. It's a shame movie like this isn't made any more.
