Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, though I imagine MTV sees this random, angular material as its primary selling point and is much less concerned about the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music to live, and this show makes me feel really emotional. For me, Wondsershowzen has a completely separate function from most TVs. Instead of turning off or distracting the senses (which can often be really nice at times), it awakens my right and wrong spirit. It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I don't think many viewers absorb most of this shows content, but if they do, kudos to TV viewers everywhere.
