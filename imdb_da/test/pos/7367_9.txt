Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent peace at work. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast that you can see from IMDb. The reason I brought the movie was because of Christine Taylor and the love of horror movies. Let's get to the headline <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 teenagers in this movie after they crashed their car, deciding to tell some creepy stories. 2. There are 3 stories and the main plot (the 4 teenagers are the main plot). 3. The best story is "people can also lick" in my opinion. the least scary story is possibly "honeymoon" or 2nd story (can't remember the name "<br/> <br /> 4." People can also lick "is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl over the internet He starts chatting with a girl called Amanda and then goes into her house. Very scary things, this story will make you think twice about chatting with someone online, basically a pervert goes into her house and things go awry. <br /> <br /> 5. The main drawing is cute and simple, youth crash, tell stories, try to freak each other out, but there is a very nice twist in the end. that teens collide their car to another couple, but the kids do not like to see if the couple are okay, they just talk about the couple they have crashed into. <br /> <br /> Men and women who made this movie made it frighten people, not make money, unlike "scream" and "i know what you're going last summer ", this movie is made to scare you. "Scream" and "I know what you did last sum is" made to make Big time cash. Although this movie was not pushed as publicly as screaming, it's still 10 times better than screaming and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are great and have realistic features. The cast who play these characters are good. Christine Taylor does a fabulous job with Lauren, doesn't go over the top with the actor. The guy who plays Eric (lauren's younger brother) also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also be freaked out. Screaming is like a joke film, the killer is a joke, and the kids are stupid <br /> <br /> Unlike screams and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a movie in A movie should have been more noticeable.
