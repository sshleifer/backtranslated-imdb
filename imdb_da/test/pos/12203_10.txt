A new and innovative show with a large casting that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful. It's too bad that her second show "Miss Match" was canceled. I'm just glad she came back on "Surface". I can't wait to return "Surface". This show is really something unique to see. With an eerie underwater world akin to Jurassic Park, this show keeps you wondering what's next. Nim is adorable, though he is going to be something bigger and much more vicious. There are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old issues. When something like "Surface" comes together, just say "THANK YOU!".
