The last film that gave a vibrant and disturbing look at what insanity is probably was in dreams. In that movie, you didn't see insanity you were there. Now comes The Cell along with an updated and much more worrying depiction of the inside of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into a shameless little boy's seemingly innocent mind, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and so scary. The things she later sees in Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things have never been seen in movies before. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell isn't exactly something that is truly groundbreaking. In fact, it's pretty much the same as the story in the lamb's silence. You have a killer in detention, and these people have to think about finding a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in the silence of the lamb you must enter a murderer's mind to find another murderer as well as his present victim while you are in The Cell, enter thoughts of a murderer to find his own victim. Despite the sadly weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. Nothing ever made by yourself comes close to it. <br /> <br /> The film also had a good direction and was extremely well-acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his distinctive outstanding performances (he was as good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 reconstruction of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez presents the other good work in his career (the other is the big one out of his). Nothing can be said about the cinematography of The Cell to give it enough credit, it was imaginative and fascinating, and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in film history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made movie and it deserves to be recognized.
