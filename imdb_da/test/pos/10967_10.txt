John Cassavette decided as his first film, of course as a shot at a shoestring in New York, not even having a script with dialogue and delivering a 1959 move similar to Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm - all actors know what they have to do and say and have the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, it is one of the most realistic look at the beat generation, jazzed sweetly in its score and tells a story of racist tensions. A group of black siblings is the centerpiece where you try to get better footage than the average strip club, and have a sister, much more light-skinned than him who gets mixed up with a white man in a relationship that crushes both sides. The film, however, is not just about it; Cassavettes like to get their characters wandering around in New York City (which not many films did in 1959/1960), and his storytelling is the same as for the improvising jazz artists of the day. Dated, surely, but a look at movie films; Martin Scorsese mentioned this as one of his heaviest influences.
