My son Adam (5 years old) is a great Scooby Doo fan. He likes this movie. He especially liked the Loch Ness monster trying to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The mood score is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> Having seen the "Vampire Rock" movie first, this was not surprisingly very similar, as they repeat a well-worn basic drawing in a different environment. <br /> <br /> Few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the television cartoon series and even fewer will see it without children. You can either like this or love it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a kid, I'm glad my son loves it, I can almost just put it up with it now.
