After being brought up in Phenix City as a child, I recognize many of the locals in the movie, so it's like a ride down the memorial to see "The Phenix City Story" again. In fact, my granduncle is in it in one of the very first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian shirt who scores his chair out to get a better look at songs / stripper. <br /> <br /> Unless you've been there like Mr. Page and I both have, you could not I understand the story that it tells. The critic from New York calls John Patterson racist, probably without having had a meeting with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your point in raising Mr. Patterson's employment now? It has nothing to do with the movie you are supposed to review. How in the world can you lean back and judge either them or this movie when you probably haven't gone further than yourself in the Southern Bronx? It has been my experience that people who do so simply try to feel morally superior to the people depicted in the film. In most accounts of the time, both were Mr. Pattersons basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, like most of the people who lived in Phenix City. <br /> <br /> By the way, is it so difficult for those living outside the South to believe there are good and decent people even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they assume that everyone who lives in a small southern town is racist? My parents lived there and yet they did not tolerate it in our household. Others did not tolerate it, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the will ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is simple and direct. It's not the whole story --- Hollywood added some sensationism when the movie was made. Parts of it were completely on target. Other parts of it border on adventure. And if it's the source someone uses to determine how people in small southern cities are, they must grasp and understand what most of us do - it's just a movie.
