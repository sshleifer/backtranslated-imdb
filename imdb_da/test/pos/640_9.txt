Billy Hughes is a stupid young lady working for makeup on a cheap horror image filmed in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy is locked in the film studio. Later on, she hears that someone might be in the building and go to check it out. This is how she stumbles upon a woman who is brutally murdered while being filmed. After deleting the killers' links, Billy informs the authorities only to be red-faced when the men show that it was an act. Billy knows what she saw, and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground characters who think she has something of importance. I don't know how this heartwarming sleeper walked past me, but I thought it was a much older flick. However, there is one thing, but it must be one of the most cruel and intense thrillers I've seen in a while. It's just a big builder and pretty much everything is in place! The first half of the move is surprisingly gripping with tight sequences that have your heart in your neck and shoot us with an atmospheric transient environment of alienation. Underling this is a humorous wicked black stripe. The errors show up in the story as it loses the furious grip, it kept so early, and goofy humor (or better puts comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richards characters is a hit and miss affair of being too powerful. In the long run, it could have done without. Despite some small moments, this aspect did not prevent me from doing so. For me, the soft end they decided to go with was just not right. <br /> <br /> The exciting mysterious premise was scary for the bone and packed some disturbing items. So the multi-facet was the coherence and its excitement, there was something fresh about how this all plays out, and the nervous jolts and tireless tensions are woven into a series of sudden plot shifts and twists. Really, the excellent use of the new idea of ​​this disability and disability made the situation by placing it in a foreign place where not many spoke English, and then we are also in the confusion. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a horrible portrayal of the American blunt girl Billy. The way she could show the erratic feelings through her eyes and actions gave it a little grudge and credibility. Director Anthony Waller shoots the girl in a pretty stylish, timely and skillful way, without losing the ugly look that allows for from its rigid surroundings, and a vigorously airy music score is constantly on you. The only real name to appear was small, cameo part of Alec Guinness. The performances were all fine, especially Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov's nail business as the Russian killers. <br /> <br /> This key feature, which is mostly unknown, is far superior to your average dark thriller. Highly recommended.
