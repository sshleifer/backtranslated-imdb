All Risto Jarva's films are worth seeing. Some like "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are best films in their genre and have reached the status of a classic in Finnish cinema history. <br /> <br /> Most people have created an impression of the actor Antti Litja through Jarva's film. Litja has served as a leading role in three of Jarva's films, all of which were successful at box office and film reviews. It is great to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in advertising (I think it was tele-operator Sonera's TV adds where Litja went to mountain fell in Lapland with hare in his arms. Everibody, who has seen the movie , know what I'm talking about.) "Jäniksen Vuosi" is a beautiful movie with great actors and good movie locations - like the famous little town in Lapland, Sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world is held - the Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend it for everyone to go there in June - but remember hot clothes and raincoat :)
