Lost has been one of the most fascinating and exciting experiences I have ever seen. Not only is it the mother of chance, but every time you think you can create the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a whole new direction. Take this accident, for example. In the US navy, giving Sayid the way to become a torture, is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in Hatch. Fate, uh? Yes right! I guess we all have to wait to see what's next in the life of the wonderful people in the strange island in the middle of heaven. Knowing that several of my favorites, Desmond, Sayid and Mr. Eco, has a fuzzy fate. I think along with 24 and The Shield, this is one of the best TV shows ever, of course, keeping the Twin Peaks in a special place.
