Much said without words. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It was made in color as in today's film, but a special mono-color use (with shadows) that depicted meaning, mood, meaning and time. It should be seen in color as it becomes a completely different movie. The story, by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerl√∂f, is presented effectively. You never have a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. Changes in the Swedish society at that time are subtle layers. Most recommended. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class, and I want to add it to my movie library.
