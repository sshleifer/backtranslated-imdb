As a movie, the Italian job is fine at best; Good (not good) deals <br /> <br /> Beautiful visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough <br /> <br /> to go on. But as a car commercial for MINI's new race <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Okay, this is a typical movie with the odd twist (underwater safe cracking was nice, if not unlikely), and the casting was pretty solid. /> <br /> (except for a wrong Wahlberg), but since it all came <br /> <br /> down to the right "stars" of this picture, the three MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping, <br /> <br /> bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. The audience I was <br /> <br /> actually sits among "odd" and "aahed" when Theron's small <br /> <br /> red number first hit the screen (strangely, neither she nor <br /> < br /> Wahlberg achieved the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as an <br /> <br /> interesting and humorous band of characters, with the only real <br /> < br /> uninspired performance is the usually good Marks <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Why he claims this is his best movie I can't imagine; his <br /> <br /> character is completely one note and he plays him so softly that <br /> <br /> was like Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and was resident <br /> <his body. Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, though <br /> <br /> nothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect, and they run Napster jokes (including a combo of the Napster founder, <br /> <br /> Shawn Fanning) is fun; He and some of Mos Def's early <br /> <br /> lines add some needed sparks of humor. Unfortunately <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland are not near enough <br /> <br /> screen time. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away and <br /> <br /> the dialogue is combed with bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt < br /> <br /> the movie crews were reinventing the wheel here as taken as a <br /> <br /> typical action / excitement flick it comes out okay. Worth looking at <br /> <br /> Cheap night I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Not worth it is weight in gold, but gives good fillings.
