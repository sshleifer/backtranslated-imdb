Fans of apocalyptic movies will enjoy this well-deserved low-cost thriller, which is essentially a remake of the 1951 George Pal classic "When Worlds Collide." A comet is heading for a near-collision with the earth, and when his co-workers ignore his warnings of doom, eccentric researcher Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly create an underground sanctuary. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds through the eyes of the muscular golf war veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati), who unintentionally discovers Crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that Crawford is wrong to keep his project hidden from the rest of humanity . As the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die must create interesting drama. <br /> <br /> While the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoy the story more than I did Spielberg's World War because I feel this manuscript is better. A certain suspension of scientific reality is required, but it is worthwhile for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
