A very credible and disturbing film showing the effects of war on the public gives Shame a chilling understanding, oh Ingmar Bergman's conviction. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feel. There is no soft or hard lighting or a series of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply depicted as it would be in reality. At times, the story was confusing, but perhaps to give a sense of the characters' state of mind ?? how they do now also knows what is happening or why. The simplicity of the film made it a bit boring, but I could understand how the instructor is trying not to glamorize the story and the points. He portrayed the harsh and disturbing events and effects of the war. Initially, the characters were introduced and displayed as content with lighter settings and very long drawn shots. When suddenly the war hit them, they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots. Bergman did a good job of letting us be consumed by the war itself and presenting a picture of what so adequately matched the war. Although the story itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.
