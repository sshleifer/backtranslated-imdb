Okay so there was the odd hole in the plot, you could run a zeppelin through, but how good were the emotional things handled? It would have been so easy to get down in the cheesiness, but the author pulled it off. The image of the former female cyberman makes crying sounds like she / she saw her reflection after regaining her feelings, is one that will stay with me forever. It is twice now that the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetic, as the previous one is the last Dalek from series one, but at Jove it is the work. In addition, the other ex-woman who had been "upgraded" to the threshold of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognized her husband after she became "cyber" and you have a permanent neck. Keep going!
