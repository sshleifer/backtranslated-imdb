Along with the even more underrated, The Sun Shines Bright, the Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of extraordinary beauty and narrative purity, well-acted by members of Ford's warehouse, including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Jr. Like almost every Ford movie, it is a meditation on freedom and society. It is also remarkable for a much more positive depiction of Indians than in most of Ford's films. Ford, for all his mistakes, remains the supreme poet of the American poem.
