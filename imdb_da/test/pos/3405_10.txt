I was 13 when this mini-series (and its successor north and south, book II) was first sent. I was already imprisoned by the personal interest stories in / about our American Civil War, which is what interest me in seeing this made-for-TV program. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old, and I just love it more. It's full of history, beautiful costuming, real characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters, all of which are going to worry deeply. There are intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, desire, struggles, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Although I had the full set of episodes on tape, I recorded back as it was originally aired, I purchased the complete set of both N&S and N & S II from Columbia House for some years since they became available. Once every couple of years I take a whole weekend and see all the repayments back and forth, and I'm sorry when the last episode rolls to an end because I find myself able to continue to see the story of these people's lives. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this mini-series more highly.
