H.O.T.S. is a fun movie for a trip back to when skin flicks had a more positive fun agenda. They were made to titrate and get a few laughs. Everything seems less cynical and jaded. The girls have all natural characters, and some are Playboy playmates. The simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non-sanctioned sorority house to return to the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them. Instead of the average exciting tricks today, most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun. The women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. To keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia handles, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky housewife and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaducci from Partridge Family. If you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
