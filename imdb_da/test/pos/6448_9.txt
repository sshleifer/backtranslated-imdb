I read the above comment and can't believe it! Of course it is a children's movie, it is an adaptation of a children's book !! This movie is easy to get hold of, try play.com or Amazon and it's very easy to get a copy! Witnesses are fun for both children and adults, and the adventure is pure without violence! It is perfectly suitable for children of all ages! The songs are fab, and yes, a little repetitive but that's what kids need, and while they see it, my little ones were heard singing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very nice and worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!
