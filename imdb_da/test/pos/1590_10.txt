Enjoy every moment in this light music play match (Mahler's 5th is beautiful but listen to the vocal part of the 3rd symphony so beautifully used in this movie). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overwhelming power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, lack of logic of love and worship. I am also a huge fan of Bogarde and think he was rarely so wonderful (try him in the "waiter"). Note: I recommmend several views.
