Without a doubt, a great all-round shows that if it appears today, it would attract a great deal. Back lights were only 6 episodes and a trailer, but deserved several more series to really bring it up to speed. With excellent performances by highly talented and versatile Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, it really took the form of Proffesionals, The Sweeney and Thief Takers. History lines are based on the diplomatic protection services and with good movie footage and stories and scene sites, it was out of some of the unwanted problems being combed by other television production companies. I do not think it has also been shown on terrestrial television, such as Sky or Freeview, witch is a shame as if it should appear today, I am sure it would get a great viewing audience.So I hope one day The guys at Carlton TV decide to release it on DVD, toast, Nick.
