that I have never seen any of this beloved of the puppies, let alone a production of Venetian merchant, I can not comment on how faithful it is to go past adjustments to the game so I will treat it as just another movie trying to be more than novocaine for the eye MoV is an instant gripping film about a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his merchant friend antonio (iron) and a jewish money lender shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> plot summary <br /> < bassiano is broke and needs money to woo the lovely portia (collins) he goes to his friend antonio who sypathises with his friends problems, so borrowing some money from shylock now antonio does not like Jews in general and especially shylock and shylock bitter and twisted by the abuse he suffered from Antonio in particular and Christians generally go in for borrowing Antonio money on condition that if Antonio does not repay the loan within the agreed deadline, then hylock cut a pound of meat from antonio's body <br /> <br /> The movie is breathtakingly beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way that one has to think about what each line means, which in turn causes the viewer to gain insight into the signs and their motivations <br /> <br /> It seems to me to be a movie about the choices that shylock is making and how to make wrong choices leads to shylocks ruin <br /> <br /> from moment, shylock requires his pound of meat he is doomed, for the rest of the world is against him and connives to get his doom <br /> <br /> this disturbed me a lot, usually in a movie when a victim gets a chance vengeance on those who have harmed him, whether the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error in his ways leading to a great hug <br /> <br /> the victim is not quickly seen as the villain and removed from his fortune and believe < br /> <br /> This movie is a powerful and subtle depiction of casual anti-Semitism, which shows how an entire community can turn one ndretal and make it seem like the victim is really the offender <br /> <br /> I was blown up by this movie 10/10
