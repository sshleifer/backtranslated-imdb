It's a very good comedy movie. I just liked it. I don't know why I love this movie, I just love it. Storyline: It's a story of two boys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) who want to get rich quick by taking all the short cuts in the book. Amar is the son of an honest shaman, Murli Manohar (Deven Verma) in Mumbai, while Prem is the son of Bankeylal Bhopali (Jagdeep), a hard-working tailor in Bhopal. Both Amar and Prem sell their father's shop and house zero into a hill station, respectively, where a beautiful wealthy heiress Raveena (Raveena Tandon) has come from London accompanied by his friend secretary Karishma (Karishma Kapoor) for the purpose of getting married to a skilled Indian. The lucky man to ask Raveena will inherit her entire wealth of Ram Ramopop Bajajs (Paresh Rawal). Amar and Prem see their getting rich quick chance and woo Raveena, each trying to out do the other. Enter Teja (Paresh Rawal in a dual role) whose only ambition in life has been to get hold of his twin brother Ram Gopal Bajajs millions. Then Teja plants Bhalla. (Shehzad) and Robert (Vijoo Khote) in Raveena's house to help him fulfill his ambition. As the story progresses, it turns out to be a sour chase from Ram Gopal Bajaj's wealth, full of humor, romantic excitement and chills. Will Raveena & Karishma look through Amar and Prem's evil intentions? Will Teja succeed in his motives? See everything in the super comedy ANDAZ APNA APNA. <br /> <br /> Aamir, Salman, Raveena, Karishma and Paresh there the best. <br /> <br /> Good music. <br /> <br /> Good direction. <br /> <br /> Good history and manuscript. <br /> <br /> and very good comedy !!!!!!
