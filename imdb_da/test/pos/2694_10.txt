King of Queens are comics. Kevin James, who plays IPS delivery Doug Heffernan, is extremely fun, Leah Remini, who plays Doug's wife Carrie, is incredibly hot (# 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list) and very fun. The true magic of the show But the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I have to admit that I never saw this show until 2006. When I had turned it over, it never seemed fun, but with the cancellation of friends, still and yes dear, I needed a new comedy. In fact, King of Queens gives a chance I discovered it was absolutely fantastic. So fun that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and then every season in 8 hours blocks. I strongly urge anyone who has not seen this treasure to check it out. You will not be disappointed.
