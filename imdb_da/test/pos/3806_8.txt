This movie can be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then exposing your friends to watching these movies too. If you are something like me and you are probably, you will laugh for years to get to the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money from a guy with children, and then the guy takes these kids into the woods like Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene The kitchen is beautiful with a comic genius of buffoonery: "Inspection manager - Here!" and the lines to follow will remain in my mind forever. When I have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "What was it?!?" so if you are in the mood for one of these types of movies, yippee! This movie is so OOP, it's not fun anymore, as probably the easiest way to get it, would be online auctioning. The first time I saw it was from a rental.
