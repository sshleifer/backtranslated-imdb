I have no idea what the budget of this movie was, but whatever it was, they made it work! I've seen movies that use 100x the amount (Pearl Harbor anyone?) And suck 200x worse. This movie has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton starring Adam, an average college student wrapped up in a game called Great AllNighter "led by Leon! This guy rock! A" genius "with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate games for a lot of people to play, but he does not just choose his friends, he has a team of jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids and of course Flounder's team, who are the "evil ones." This movie is not black and white There is Many grayscale, Adam is not the altruistic all-wrong, he treats Alex P. as a crap, and Flounder is the way he is due to pressure from his father and a jerky belly. others too! This movie rock! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better track? This is gold Jerry! GOLD! Maybe I'm from another generation, but I love movies that seems to be far fetched but still has roots in reality never happened ... but it could. Eeee e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh and look for a young Paul Rubens still working on the Pee wee character. PS that Devra Clinger WAS / is HOT! She must have been a bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS MOVIE!
