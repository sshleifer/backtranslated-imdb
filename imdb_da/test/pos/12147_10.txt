I watched this movie at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, when one of the writers, Jos√© Giovanni, was honored. It stands tall as a great noir-crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. Attention to each character and complex psychological depictions describing loyalty, betrayal, love and hope are immense. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent movie. Up there with the best of Melville. (The title of English 'Class all risk' in French 'Classe tous risques' is word play on 'Classe Touriste', which means 'Tourist Class'.
