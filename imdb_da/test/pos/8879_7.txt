Now, throwing Momma off the train wasn't a good comedy, but it's a fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the whole movie is not literally about it, even if it is about something equally scary. Danny De Vito essentially wants to kill his indulgent mother and quickly move forward, some random and fun events take place. The principle is quite fun, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito come in were great. Some of the scenes didn't seem to fit in for me, but that didn't make it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a crazy comedy, it looks good and should be seen once just to say you saw it.
