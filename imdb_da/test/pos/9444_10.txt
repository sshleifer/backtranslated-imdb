This has to be one of the best episodes of Doctor Who I've seen since coming back last year. There is a brilliant mix of entertainment, fear and tenderness, all mixed, which is similar to a fantastic episode. The ood was excellently designed, and I'm pretty sure there will be many ood jokes in the coming weeks. I'm even guilty of it already. I especially liked the way we saw a different perspective on Rose's and Doctor's relationship and end, and this is the first time I've ever hidden behind a pillow! I can't wait for next week's episode to figure out how to get out of this mess.
