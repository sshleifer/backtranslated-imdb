Some time ago, we read about the results of a poll taken by some newspaper writers. The questions asked were only two and were short and correct to the point. <br /> <br /> Question 1 asked the respondent to tell who was his most beloved college football team. Question number 2 asked the tab to mention his most hated football team. The answer to both questions was simply Notre Dame! ND's tops on both lists! Yes, love them or hate them, but you don't understand. The roots of this unique position of this "Incentive" College Football Powerhouse are found in the life and career of an adult, little immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago named Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), came relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne. in a 1930 aircraft accident. It was about 10 years after the film was released. That would mean that initial work on the project started about 8 years after our country's great loss of Mr. Rockne. His likeness and voice were known from Newspapers, Radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knut's Widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne and Notre Dame University had approval rights by choosing the actor to play the Lead and okay script. We think they couldn't have done the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks that part and was even a college footballer. Ronald Reagan is cast in the central role of George Gipp **, a free spiritual student going to Notre Dame at a Baseball Scholarship! He was a "walk-on" soccer player. <br /> <br /> The game is full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran, Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. Gail Page appears as wife, Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais (fits in the historic ND vs ARMY Game at West Point.) The cast is rounded off by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the four Horsemen. Real-time Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones, 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear to themselves in scenes from Congressional Probe to College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> As for biopic, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, everyone can only say that it hits the ground and does not lower from the beginning to the end. There is also no wasted time. The entire screen time is used to move the story together. <br /> <br /> Using Notre Dame Choir, the actual Campus and all this Brass Band rah-rah marcher music all ad to the feeling of really being there. *** <br /> <br /> * To this day, although their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains an independent NCAA Football. What this means is that The Fighting Irish really plays a national level. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such deal with Family of George Gipp. There was a trial a few years ago over the scene depicting young Mr. Gipp who gave the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". TV prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were minus the speech in the deathbed scene. <br /> <br /> *** Other Notre Dame theme Movies were made over the years. OTHER WOMEN'S SPIRIT (Universal 1931) highlighted J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne look-alike coach. It also included Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, and the members of the right Notre Dame Championship Teams with the right Four Riders. Then of course we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with eg. Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton. It was also an unauthorized film, critical for Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, does it? (Let me know, dear reader, THANX !!) <br /> **** **** Warner The brothers always had good music in their, both in open themes and in random music. In this Rockne Movie they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score. Along with it were STEP NOTRE DAME and NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, who premiered at Rockne Funeral in 1930 at Notre Dame Basilica.
