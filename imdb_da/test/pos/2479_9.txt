As far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries somebody?), Is this up there with the best! It looks really right, and that is what it has for its purpose. In the latest light of events (Guantanamo), this film is even more intimidating, so one could say it was before it was time when it was released in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Of course, the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): Screw politicians and politics in general. Maybe it wasn't as smart as you could think ... but hey, don't forget: It's just a movie! ; ISLAND)
