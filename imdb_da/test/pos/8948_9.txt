I saw this in an example and it doesn't seem to have been published in the US. However, it was one of the more entertaining little comedies. It is about the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. Plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act, but the characters are very funny and memorable. <br /> <br /> The play is well across the board. Sure to be overlooked in crunch of blockbusters, this is a movie worth looking out for. I know I'll try to catch this in the theaters again and / or buy the video.
