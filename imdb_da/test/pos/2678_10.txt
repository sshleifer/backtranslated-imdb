Wow, in my opinion, it's the best sitcom page friends. If you've had a crap day, just put yourself down with a beer (if you're old enough, it is. If not a root beer should do.) And watch a few episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness . /> <br /> What I like most is that everyone on the show is very funny and they all have a fantastic comedy timing. After a while, you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the show is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat, but still happy with what he loves his wife's job and friends. The father-in-law is flying in the ointment, but hey nothings perfect.
