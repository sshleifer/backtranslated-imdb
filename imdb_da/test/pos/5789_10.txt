I always knew the day was coming. We all knew. There is only so much oil in the soil, and one day we are shorter. But shouldn't there be enough coal to use instead? And wind power or something. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me between my eyes. Oil makes the fertilizer, which is the cause of the first time in world history, almost no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortages are hit, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastic, life in the suburbs - become impossible. But the craziest insight from the documentary is: Oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our life has to change. Although substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will smooth our landing to a strange post oil world that (the documentary claims) could begin NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite its gloomy message, the documentary is often very entertaining. It contains fabulous historical footage (sober images of dark city factories and camp fun stuff from the 1950s) that reminds us why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also gives hope that a massive effort started now, could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place. My only complaint about the documentary is that it doesn't spend time on the mystery of why we find these things out now. How can this be a major emergency suddenly? We knew in the 1970s that we were preparing for a post-oil world - and we began to prepare for alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to follow up on President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago sentenced us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why didn't anyone shout for it on soapboxes? In the end I found the documentary very convincing; and it left me with the terrible chill to be pulled out of a very nice dream. This has to look for everyone not afraid to meet a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about. <br /> <br /> - Charles
