If you only see an Ernest movie in your life, do it here! This is by far the best in the series, with its non-stop laughter and clever humor to suit all ages. The other "Ernest" flicks were also good, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not ME, though.). In this film, Ernest P. Whorrel is awarded a jury fee for a murder case. The killer, Nash, just happens like our bumbling hero Ernest. Mr. Nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from prison by knocking him out to change identities with him, and then we see how Ernest responds to slimes. <br /> <br /> A good flick! If you haven't already seen it, see it!
