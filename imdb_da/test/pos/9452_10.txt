I just rented this movie from the video store last night. It's new and not released long ago here, the rent was only overnight. Me, my little sis and my older brother, who usually hate to see these kind of movies, sat down and watched. When the movie started and after seeing it and looking at it for a while, we were all laughing historically. Even my brother. This movie is fun, I actually screamed. No matter how funny some movies are ... Although I think it's funny, sometimes I can't laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother ended up believing it was the best "kind of movie" he had seen. I ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.
