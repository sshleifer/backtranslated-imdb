After the "Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be as dangerous as men, there was apparently an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from " It's a Food, Food, Food, Mad World "for playing the role. The cut is that sweet and blonde Provine might just be too sweet and innocent looking to get into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed a person with a lot of crumbling sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type. She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. However, Lou Costello proves that he can make a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines, and he even engages in a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not turn to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. Gordon states, however, that everything he can be is windy, disturbed and upset, much the same character he later creates "The Lucy Show." Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man and his screenplay is limited. Special effects are convincing at present, but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least be allowed to become dangerous. As the film's main character, she takes other billing to Costello, which is in the whole movie with Dorothy disappearing several times as a part-plot. The whole movie just can't decide whether it should be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There are many good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camps that affect the rest of the movie. Still, I like this movie for its empowerment of women; There are not enough movies out there like this. If this movie had a chance to be remade today, I would highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney tops my lists of actresses that I think could and should probably play beautiful giants; although I must admit that if one of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would go quietly !!
