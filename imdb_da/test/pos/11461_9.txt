I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has nothing on this movie! Demonstrates night 2 and 3 is a total drilling, but this is a classic. It's super cheesy and the play is fine at best, but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (He's my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick in this movie, but my personal favorite is the end. Unfortunately, nothing has to do with the protagonists when the old man eats his left over Halloween apples in a pie and his neck is missing from the outside. The soundtrack is fantastic. The scene with Angela dancing is absolutely creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with each sound of a camera closing the song playing. The make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who needs perfection out of your movie experience, you might be able to give it a pass. But if you are like me and you really dig the whole Halloween, haunted house with the daughters clich√© than this is definitely a must own.
