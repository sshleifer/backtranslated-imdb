I saw this movie as a child and I long to see it again. has it survived? I discount the 1980 version as a fluff. I am sure there are many who do not feel the need to preserve these films. It is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem when it is gone. Young people today are not aware of the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one's life, a movie seen in early youth may have in later life. This movie, "The Blue Lagoon" had that effect on me. How many of us have wanted to find ourselves in a place removed by fear and chaos in the modern world. This was an idyllic story of a boy and a girl on a tropical island. There are problems to be sure, but eventually they fall in love and they have a baby. Life must be so simple and beautiful.
