Fantastic Russian WWII movie. Like most Russian WWII films, The Ascent is incredibly appalling. It is also close to its symbolism. The story follows two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who are on mission to search for food. On their journey, they are spotted by German soldiers who sow Sotnikov. Sotnikov, again, kills one of the Germans, leading to problems for the two partisans and all the others they later enter into. Russia is frozen and snowed, and it's hard not to notice that the cold goes directly to your own bones. Shepitko holds her shots close to the characters and examines all their faces. It was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1.33: 1, giving the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the whole movie is quite a performance, I felt that the first half was stronger than the other. My biggest complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very untouched Christian allegorium by its climax. I just don't think the symbolism adds much to the matter, especially since I was already fascinated by the debate between the two partisans. It's not quite fair. I weigh the pros and cons of their argument. I started to lean toward a certain character, and then the instructor comes up and tells me he is Judas! In spite of a difficult maneuver, this is still a must-see.
