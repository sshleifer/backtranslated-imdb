For those of you who like stand-up comedians, you must have heard of George Carlin. He is really one of the best comedians alive so you need to know him. <br /> <br /> But he already died, God resting him in peace. Or hell. He didn't think too much about religion, so he might as well choose hell to live forever. Haha, just fun, don't take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you! It is one of the latest works by George Carlin before his death - <br /> <br /> Me, one of his best works, a must for any fan and an almost the best of all George Carlins jokes. It's not the best ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> It has less political and religious jokes. It's just having a good time! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. It's not a concert, so it shouldn't have a quick change of shot ... the slow fading to other shots was well done. Fading is the best option for editing!
