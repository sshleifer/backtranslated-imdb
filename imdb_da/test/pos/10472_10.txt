Yes, you can look at Babette's feast as a kind of blow to Puritan Christianity, but it is much more than that. The surface of how a gifted Parisian chef flies Paris after one of his revolutions in the middle class and finds himself cast ashore in Jutland in northern Denmark, is simply the fat that makes it possible for the deeper history to develop. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people driven from the pillar to send through the centuries by feduous politicians, shovels, greedy and arrogant, killing beauty for profit, something Politics always does, pace National Endowment for The Arts, which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. Babette is at her last leg when she comes in the little village where two virgin sisters are staying and looking over their falling flock of devotees to their late pastor. They live on salt cod and black bread gruel. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in joy and sensuality as well as behavioral and mental purity. She also shows them how mental purity can lead to the control of freakishness, as we all know about these days by the neo-authoritarian in the government who would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state. or as they would tell us, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette makes a French dinner to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the deceased honorary day. The daughters and their flock believe that it is the devil who comes among them and does not promise to notice food or drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this time, in preparation for the meal, paid by Babette's winnings in a French lottery that I start to tear up. It is a poignance brought about in relation to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that flood our consciousness from morning to night through the media and the power-mongers maneuver to gain advantage over all of us here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of Babette's artistic points in the face of all the pretentious exhibitions of our modern society, and it hurts to see the play so exquisite in this amazing movie. It is together with Fanny and Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie ever, but I can only see it once in a while, because as a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters, it is something that must not be over- donated. <br /> <br /> A great, amazing movie that should be in every movie lover's library.
