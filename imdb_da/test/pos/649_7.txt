Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz for movies, big hits like "Urban Cowboy", "Any Which Way But Loose", "Smokey and Bandit" were all rage. For this reason, I suppose the producers of this movie chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as the title, hoping that it would help the movie's receipts with receipts by drawing the same "Urban Cowboy" amount. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed the theaters, and I suppose it does it partly by being charged with a badly chosen title. Its the same problem now burdens it on video and it's too bad because it's a pretty good movie and in a comedy style before that time. Either way, anyone who can remember 1981 is likely to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that this movie is bombarded. But I think it would have anyway, even if it hadn't been a bad title. Its a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that it is clearly a father or * uncle anyway) to the kind of comedies made today. For his day, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was rather full of insinuation and a kind of frankness on life that didn't become popular in comedies until much later. Although it is clearly a child of "Airplane", it is more mature, and although it is definitely not "Knocked Up", it clearly points in that direction. The characters are more "comedy-mature" because they are low key and never think anything they do is anything but serious. The jokes are in choosing what to emphasize and the camera's views and the way you look and their situations. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A good look back at the very early 80s. The people in this movie are dressed and acting like everyday people in 1981 did. It was clearly meant to reflect on the times and be a blatant comic commentary on everyday life around them. I don't know if my review helps you, but it's really a good, sometimes kind of Excellent movie that is worth hiring if you want to see how many faces known today look when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young, it's hard to understand in some cases. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just getting toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this was "Tootsie" who finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was undoubtedly the largest "current" star on the day this film was made. Back in 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out like a star as an adult tells voice of lead child character in the popular 80s sitcom "The Wonder Years" There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, it is nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally get her Oscar ten years after this for "Driving Miss Daisy". There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her last movie appearances. Although she had a brilliant career, she did not get her Oscar for four years after this in 1985's "Trip to Bountiful", which she deserved rightly, and she died very shortly after receiving that prize. <br /> Plus, there are many other faces in this movie, actors who are not big stars but who have done tons of support. Many are well-known even though you cannot think of their name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasant little redirect. A bunch of people with a variety of problems exhibited from various locations each for their own individual independent reasons, all of which, in a weak Altman-esque way, end up towards Florida and unknowingly announce a revelation voucher in the small town of Ticlaw, Florida the effects of being bypassed by the newly constructed interstate nearby, which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the city out of the map. <br /> <br /> And that's also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of ​​the interstate system, which was only recently "completed". It had taken a generation off when it was approved by Congress around 1960, for many years, when various parts were built and then "went live", and in 1980 most of the system had been built and all connected and first For the first time, the promise of what the interstate system would have been transformed into was. And people were enchanted by it. All in 1980 was basically an "interstate freeway veteran" in the sense that everyone had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads, as it did not have red light or stop signs only on and off ramp and that it went to places that were previously less accessible. In 1980 you could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything other than eating and sleeping and a bathroom. And that was all new then. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and is not satisfactory, although it is a spectacular moment. What makes it good is that the journey is not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless despite being such a product of its time. Forget its title; Instead, let it take you down memory path.
