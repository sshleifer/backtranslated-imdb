Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish because of its outrageous characters, indecent plot and lack of any performance at all. The actors in this movie have given us a real OTT masterpiece to be seen as believed. The plot is centered on Wu Tang villain Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become the highest martial artist. To do that, he makes up with a clan of ninjas, led by three gentlemen ?? gold lame ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja ?? and successfully destroy the Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is their job to convey the knowledge of Shaolin finger jab to a new generation to defeat the ninjas and Abbott White, whose peace and order must be restored. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is a tough enemy to beat as he is able to make himself almost indestructible by sucking the life force out of warm naked chickens (an excuse for some welcome-free nudity!). Other viewers in the shop for the viewers include lots of very impressive games (despite the fact that it gets faster), some really amazing clothes (the aforementioned gold lame ninja, Abbott White's Yin Yang suits and even some snotters wearing Swastika tunic), ninja that turns into a flying blanket plus some cheesy make for good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on the display of this movie ?? surely a good reason not to pass on this gem.
