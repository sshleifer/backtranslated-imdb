Screenwriters Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (by all people) Dorothy Parker enables Director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what may have been his favorite movie theme: innocent man, mistaken for crime, taking it on the lamb. Hitchcock, as some credit originating the story, engineers a great thrill in plotting a warehouse worker accused of the explosion that killed his best friend; He goes on the journey to find the real culprit. Lots of big-scale excitement, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) does surprisingly fine work. Even forever smuggled Robert Cummings comes in the right spirit! *** from ****
