Having seen this without knowing all the hoopla around the protagonist, without knowing that it was based on real life events, I must say I'm impressed. "Greenwich Murder" is an over-average production for a television movie - the play is uniformly good, especially Christopher Meloni puts a standby performance and the teenagers stand out in what is difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl telling the movie is a brilliant blow that raises the movie from just good to excellent. The script is exemplary of what is essentially film-of-the-week food, and the cinematography is beautiful.
