Wonderful, wonderful, amazing. What more can you say? Jacobi is the best Hamlet to ever grace the scene and catch every inch of the character. Each nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some have complained about his age, but you can't honestly tell when you watch the movie. If he sees something, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her plays are acceptable, but she just doesn't see that part. The only real extraordinary performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, a great Claudius. The rest of the casting is good, but Jacobi is what really lifts this telecom play.
