This movie was different. It took a kind of typical thriller story and reached a more interesting, profound look at an individual character's struggle with faith. Of course, it contributed to the main achievement, by Andrew McCarthy, being quite outstanding. The other performances were also quite interesting, but not so consistent. The end was a bit of a disappointment, but there were plenty of good moments. The filmmakers tried something else here - they didn't just go after the obvious chills and scares. This is a dark movie (not for everyone), but if you want to be entertained and not talked to, try this one.
