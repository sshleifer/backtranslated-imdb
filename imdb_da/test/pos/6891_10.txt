Although it has been in the air for 6 years now, Promised Land was one of the shows that comes together once or twice in a generation. Freestanding, supporting end (among them, Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney, packing his family and just saying "to hell with it all" after being exposed to so many disappointments and incidents since returning from Vietnam years earlier. I believe that many of the Vietnam-era veterans, which I myself included, could really relate to McRaney's thought process by finally deciding on his action. Many of us did just the same in real life, having returned from that war and found that America was not the same place we left. The show not only gives values ​​but an insight into what was happening in a veteran's life. In these two respects alone, I think it is one of the more exciting TV series of our time. Why this program only runs for 3 years is beyond me.
