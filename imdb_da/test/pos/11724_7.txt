Burt Reynolds riposte to Clint Eastwood's perimeter on his redneck comedian with his orangutan comedies was to make his own Dirty Harry in Chicago-style thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally intended for John Boorman, but ultimately directed by the star itself, it is an out-of-out commercial package with Reynolds a narcissus that is busted down to the Vice Squad (literally - they are in the basement) that goes on to stitch a mysterious criminal gentleman who supports Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds tends to lose history at times, he has a good eye for individual scenes and gets almost a performance out of Rachel Ward as the top-notch hooker he falls for. The romantic subplot is exceptionally well developed. There are a few good action scenes and some nice details, such as. Having Vittorio Gassman's lookalike villain a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a killer who both witnesses from adjacent apartments in the same building. One of the star's better movies from its glory, it's no classic, but it offers a more than effective Saturday night special.
