This is an entertaining surrealistic movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, Martin Scorsese's excellent surrealistic film. The film follows the adventures of a 10-year-old child named Gus, who runs a red Ford Mustang across some fictional states with names like Tristana (A tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's film, perhaps?), Essex & South Lyndon, in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various Chimera Company petrol stations. The movie has a surreal feel to it because many things are unusual, such as. Money that is like a blank paper with numbers on it. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are ugly for Gus on his journey. They tattoo him, beat him, but it does not stop the child from his relentless quest. Some oddball actors like David Lynch, who are involved with Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea, also make appearance. Jack Nance plays a motel owner who, when he first meets Gus, tells him: "If you see any squirrels, give them to me". This is a movie where a man and his wife refrain from their young children because the man owes Gus $ 100; and a mother urges her son to raise his voice higher while he is rudely speaking. If you are a fan of Twin Peaks and surrealistic movies, you like it here. A strange little gem of a movie.
