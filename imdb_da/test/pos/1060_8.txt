Personally, I don't like many b / w movies, but there is something magical about this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a magazine about how she is "Martha Stewart" in Connecticut. Of course she lies. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to host a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who will be alone for Christmas, invites you to the farm for the Christmas party. Then it just gets wild. <br /> <br /> When the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm vacation experience. Plus, the characters are funny. Mr. Yardley always shouts orders, and Liz's friend Felix always shouts 'Disaster!' When Things Go Wrong Finally, the movie ends as a Christmas movie will end. a jolly fat man laughing and shouting: "What a Christmas!" <br /> In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
