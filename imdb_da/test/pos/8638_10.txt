With an opening segment that mimics the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and crooked notions of reality to tell the broken story of a mistaken bitart Hollywood actress / waitress Diane Selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, engaged to hotshot director Adam Kesher. The film takes place effectively in Diana's anti-drug head; we are witnessing his insane distortions, her desires, regrets, obsessions, and fears. Using the dream direction as a way of presenting two concepts to reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and imagination, but actively intervenes. The last 45 minutes are as dreamlike as what came before; and the cumbersome air of detached worldwide ambiguity still permeates and breaks the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films of nightmares and dreams. Lynch's films borrow from many films, old and new, but ultimately a movie is unlike any other except the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It continuously challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet, it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined, because Lynch made us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was lacking in all of his other films except Straight Story. He does so by presenting Diana's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a healthy Canadian maid destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an exciting story that confirms and negates in equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does she mean? Who is the boom behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the decaying corpse on Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth Really Exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-explanatory recording of the film's fiction status? Lynch is not prepared to answer any question he poses, and instead chooses to present his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstracts and motives. <br /> <br /> The action is top notch, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, who does not yet obscure this performance. Laura Harring has the necessary Hayworthesque style as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings a freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. It was staggering and a serious injustice that not one of them was nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that requires careful viewing and analysis. The mystery at the heart of the movie remains in Lynch's hands, but half of the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of apparent inconsistencies he presents. Upon closer inspection there is a clear sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure, but denies the imaginary abundance of narrative cohesion. In the end, this is Lynch's key movie.
