"Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror movies coming out over the last ten years and could be one of the best horror movies in the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> Chucky's boyfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), manages to find his violent remnants after being sucked into the fan at the end of Part 3 and bringing him to life in his trailer park. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are afflicted by his uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany disturbs Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers his soul into the doll she got him. For them to be placed back in human bodies, they must travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. Jessie sees it as an opportunity to escape from Ritter and they sit down on the journey, but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several bizarre events force them to stop at a bed and breakfast. When several more are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) up to rectify the situation. They convince him neither one of them is the killers when the police have started to solve the crimes. He finds Ritter's body in a suitcase in the back car. Thinking he was created, he confronts them with it. Chucky and Tiffany are so right to prove they did, causing Woolvett to kill. The group steals a motorhome and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to light each other and give them enough to escape. Chucky regains Jade and forces her to get her amulet. Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud, giving Jessie and Jade enough time to kill them both when police arrive and clear them for the crimes. <br /> <br /> The good news: I'll give as much money as possible to props for the FX department, as Chucky and Tiffany appear as convincing. The scenes along with them are the film's main highlights, including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany has Chucky about how serial killers in the 90s work. That said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that is actually fun is incredible. Chucky gets the most out of them, but Tiffany also cracks a few gems. It's actually more fun than what Hollywood calls comedies these days. Gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic. In fact, several deaths in this movie are original and creative. Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a brilliant scene. The Honeymooning couple were also a good death scene. For teenage love, mating Stable and Heigl works well. They have a good chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. I must also admit that the first time I saw this movie, I jumped during certain scenes, and it shows what an incredible job leader Yu did. Apparently he learned to do the same with "Freddy vs Jason." He knows how to set-up and pay-offs, and here he shows some good skills that have an impression of Hong Kong's impact on appearance and style. He could be the next big horror director if he continues to fill his CV with movies like the two. Nice soundtrack, like "Freddy vs Jason." The bad news: For cheesy movie fans, this will be a good find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this movie. The movie knows it's a cheesy movie and enjoys it, making a serious fan off because of things like one-liners. It's not that bad for a movie, but it must be seen in the frame that it is a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes adds the movie, not to take it away. Remove yourself from this state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie. The Final Judgment: Fans of cheesy movies and the other "Child's Play" movies will find out about this movie. For serious horror fans you have to look at it, but keep in mind that it is not a serious movie and that cheesiness must be there and you may find yourself liking it. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic violence, graphic language, short nudity on a doll, a shady doll sex scene, some drug abuse and many drug references.
