And I think that's a good thing. I've never been a Rosalind Russell fan, even though the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear that she did this. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was slightly smaller than the original movie. One of my favorite little characters in the original was Mazeppa with his scratchy nail-on-the-blackboard voice belt out "HEY! It requires a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!" and even though I missed it, I was happy to see the producers having a hard time making a carbon copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are large parts of this movie that were filmed as if you were watching a stage, giving you the feeling that you're in the theater, not just in the cinema . I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be a little less repetition of the song "Let me entertain you", which becomes quite annoying after the 5th time you hear it.
