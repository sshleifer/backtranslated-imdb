This is a truly hilarious movie and one I've seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller, like David Arquette as his brother. You crawl with embarrassment at the thought that she is returning to high school as the film is a reminder of which high school really was! Her outfits are crazy and strange, and it brings memories back to those who dressed a little differently! The beautiful Michael Vartan was lovely as the teacher (wish there were teachers like that when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is great. This is a movie you can see over and over with a great soundtrack! One for all those in school in the 90s to see!
