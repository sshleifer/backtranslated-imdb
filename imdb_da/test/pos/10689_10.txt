This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fighting sequences were incredible. I don't see all of Sho Kosugi's movies, but that's probably the best of those I've seen. Probably the most impressive battle sequence was in the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, it was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences I have ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a police funeral where the ninja provides more people to bury. The last match was also very impressive. Also I liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, it was actually different from other ninja movies. So, if you're a fan of ninja movies, you'll probably like this one.
