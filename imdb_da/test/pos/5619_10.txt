For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. One evening, when Goldwyn and his wife Frances had dinner with Heifetz and his wife, setting TV star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn suggested the Heifetz star in a movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed, provided his action was kept to a minimum. And the film, originally titled "Music School" was born. The story itself is quite stocked: A streetwise boy (Gene Reynolds, best known as "M * A * S * H"), runs away from home and ends up in an economically troubled music school run by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan ). During the attempt to raise money for the school, the boy and some other children happen across the Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. After much ado, Heifetz joins the school concert and sponsors the school. <br /> <br /> The story is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several lesser gaffes, where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an honor and seen in the orchestra one few seconds later. It is not surprising how good the play is. As usual for studios, the studio transformed the inexperienced star with veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later by Ma and Pa Kettle fame), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, and a Who's Who of Character actors . Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their (uncredited) debuts in this movie, as did the old Nelson Eddy song partner Gale Sherwood (like Jacqueline Nash). Children's veterans Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn are also shown. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn hired Peter Meremblum Symphony, a highly acclaimed youth band from the Los Angeles area that appears in the movie. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (as many of them later became). Many of the children in the orchestra went on to remarkable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn were both in the theater and movies, Richard Berres was a producer and director. Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, Elliott Rapaport went on to be a prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias was a band leader, Thomas Facey a conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent director at Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins an instructor with SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the children in the orchestra pursued musical careers with large symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's plays were kept to a minimum, his wages were not. He ordered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes were to resume at a later stage, he received another $ 50,000 for another four weeks. What was fortunately not kept to a minimum was his musical output. Composer Alfred Neumann (who was once a Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled the score. Heifetz performs "Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of Manuel Ponce's "Estrellita" (with an offscreen Teddy Saidenberg accompanying), Dinicu's devilishly difficult "Hora Staccato" (from a white telephone recording with Emanuel Bay at the piano) , an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from Tchaikovsky's well-known Adante Cantabile from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the film) the final movement of Felix Mendelssohn-Barthodys E Minor Violin Concerto. During all these performances, there are many close-ups of Heifetz's performance, including some very close shots of his fingers and bends, something that would be of value to violinists who want to study his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum Orchestra also shines here and performs Arias "Caro Nome" by Verdi and "Casta Diva" by Bellini (both with Sherwood song), an arrangement of the assault by Rossini's "Barber of Seville", a short excerpt from Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" and the previously mentioned Mendelssohn concert (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard based on a scene that performs part of Chopin's Nocturne in B-Flat Minor, and a five-year-old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular "Minute" Waltz. All in all, this is an excellent movie. The AMC showed this regularly until the beginning of 1992. I haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not hard to get. If you have the chance, I highly recommend watching the movie.
