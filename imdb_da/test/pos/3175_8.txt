Hookers were me a great everyday folk story, just like anyone you might have known. Just trying to do it, my big shot is just around the corner. Then the small temptations of life creep in, the spoiler stumbles again. How much can your love take and give to the guy who really isn't that bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the pits, with the band, made several walking shots, my green 66'-corvette was in the motel party shots. Wonderful cast and crew, first rate people, down to earth movies. I had lunch with James Coburn, on Mother's Day, which wonderful man I have known him for years, I will never forget about him. My dad spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse stories, Slim was also really down to earth, they love guys, we really miss them. Real people make movies about real people, Thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
