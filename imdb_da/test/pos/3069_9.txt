This is probably located in my Top 5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I wasn't a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! It was fun by Robin Hood and was HILARIEUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together and how well it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, it was the funniest feature I have ever seen! I especially love the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie!
