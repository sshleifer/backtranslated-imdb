Expectacular ATOR's second part !! Directed quickly by JOE D'AMATO, specialist in all types of subcomponents (undergenres) for exploitation and interpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. budget debio to be discouraging or minimal. Although he is not a better movie of his antecesora, he is also not entertained, ATOR 2, it has something that makes it work. His introduction you prop it explains ATOR's origin to us with pictures of the first part. The script is incredible, like any cartoon of the brilliant ROY THOMAS. have such amazing elements within the world of the sword and such fantasy as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villains, this one interpreted brilliantly. The final this fight very well. Lack of violence and blood, but this good. It never gets boring. It has everything that was missing ATOR 1. Be charmed with my me !! 4.5
