Without a doubt the most impressive recent gay movie I've seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail upside down with this one. The way he handled the issues of faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a great job of drawing the character of Christian and Steve Sandvoss will turn your socks into Aaron's role. Both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and effects of these problems on young gay men. As a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (but not Mormon), the identification with Aaron's character was phenomenal to me. Highly recommend this movie to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young gay men deal with family and friends in an often unfriendly world. By the way, the music in this movie stinks! Another good job by C. Jay Cox.
