I walked through the hills. I walked through the laver ... crying, laughing, puked my always loving intestine out. But through it all I became whole. I became a better person to have put this experience into self-imposed degradation. It is not every day we can say that we have lived through the worst and come out on the other side with something that resembles our whole whole and intact. Friends ... neighbors - unite and be like one now. Go out and find this movie and relax in its extravagances. Place it high on the jacket and kiss its polystyrene box. Take it to bed. Take it out with you when you shop or have blind dates with strange people. They will appreciate you, the better for your sublime and unique schizophrenic slope at the cinema. And then they will throw their drink in your face (but you get the last laugh). I ran for governor with this little beauty under my belt (and you can too!). It's a treat worth having over and over again.
