For all viewers who have seen 'The Cure', I agree with this comment that it is a fantastic movie and is very cordial. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star quality in this movie along with Dexter's (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I first watched The Cure on TV, I didn't know what to expect, but when I saw this masterpiece, it soon became clear what it was all about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy who is afflicted with AIDS, sits around his backyard with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbor Eric, who initially is a little unlucky for the 2 boys, but soon became good friends. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I wondered what would happen to the two boys as they kept me wondering. I wondered how the dunk they would come to New Orleans, sitting a door with a sea biscuit while pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. There were other amazing scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that came out to me was the part when Dexter's health began to worsen. You just couldn't do without if he had to, but at the end you'll find out. I thought at the first prank they played that Dexter was really dead, of course he wasn't stupid. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter doesn't stand up to laugh or show any kind of laughter. At that time, the victim of their prank announces soon that poor Dexter was dead. On that part I lost it. I bent my eyes out, and from that scene I was crying. You just have to. As the end approaches, you begin to understand Eric's loss, and then the movie ends with a nice note with Dexter's shoes ever flowing so slowly down the river. All in all, this movie was excellent. It has laughter, adventure, feelings and sadness etc. When you put it in a blender you get an excellent, must see movie. Peter Horton has done a great job in managing this movie, and I think it's definitely one of his best. But for now I will try to search for this movie on DVD if it exists there. Once again a great movie that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster.
