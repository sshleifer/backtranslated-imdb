I admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in Navy, so I'm a little biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but nagged different people to buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the movie is great, and I have great respect for those who make these kind of documentaries, to see 200 tons of Blue Whales' cruising through the ocean is a stunning sight they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed through the story, it's just right, I don't want to know a lot of science just some of the basics, to see these things are enough for most. The BBC has the ability to put things at the right level for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A really good documentary up there with 'The World at War for' me, the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a minor criticism, it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there, I think they are degrading some of the scenes. But well done to the BBC and Discovery.
