The cast is admired and well balanced. This movie is excellent. The music is lovely, as all Burt Bacharach's music is and fits the plot line. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a plodding re-make. We see spicy actors adding true depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this shining gem of a movie. It's a treasure of the silver screen! Find it if you can - and let its magic carry you beyond the daily concerns that inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon".
