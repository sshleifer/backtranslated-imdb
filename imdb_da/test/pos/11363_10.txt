My introduction to a lifelong love for Shakespeare. My brother was 5 and I wasn't quite 7 when WTTW Chicago sent an Age of Kings. It became a family ritual to see, including reruns. As an autumn series, my father used to buy us a rare treat for the Midwest - Pomegranates; and my mother wanted popcorn on the stove. Wonderful play by actors whose names did not matter to me then (though I will never forget the painful young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but do it now! And they published scripts in paperback so we could keep up with the language. I managed to remember most of Richard III over it. So happy to see it coming out on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
