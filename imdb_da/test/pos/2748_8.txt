William Wellmann, who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made, 'Wings' (1927), returns to heaven with another rip-roaring story of dare-devil airmen. Wellmann had been an air ace in World War I, and no known biplanes as he did. Here they are stunt flying, crashing, exploding in the air and everything you can think of, plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial flight operations in 1932. And there is a good strong story that is superbly played by the gloomy Richard Barthelmess (the quiet star there made several films with DW Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real sizzler. Such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of the photofit botoxed dummies playing in movies in today's Hollywood and everyone looks alike. The story is a sad one, played with real pathos and orderly. Towards the end of the movie there are some extraordinarily exciting scenes of danger and rescue, and what should be the most brilliant blind landing in thick fog ever considered. I dare not give away the brilliant aspects of that episode. The character that Barthelmess plays is much like Wellmann himself, a really wild hell-raiser in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation would love this movie and it is very rewarding for anyone who likes good solid entertainment, love, tears and non-stop action, all in a kind of lovely Wellmann omelet.
