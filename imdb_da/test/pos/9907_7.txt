Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's good. This movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english so you have to get past it. The action was also stolen and forced, apart from what was done by the real rats, which the IMO did an excellent job of dealing with. Snap to rat wrangler. Nevertheless, the mayor has decided to cut costs, and the local waste collectors are hitting and thus leaving large piles of waste everywhere. This story has been used before, not to mention has happened in reality (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not in favor of any surprises. But that's fine. We know what to do and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie where many brain cells are not needed to follow. We have ours all the way down to the chiseled face and body, the half-hero (s) and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only in training, even though it is she who realizes what really goes on when so many people get sick and dying, and not just from a rat bite. Of course, the villain must die (okay, all the bad guys mean the rats), and the end is one of those who reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works. This is one of the movies you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is.
