This is amazing! Everything from the score - to the role of the final circle. This film is a masterpiece. It's really scary, and its effective hysterical attitude is enough to give anyone who is crawling. It is clear that the movie was not rushed, and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon on the puppet show) had a clear and precise picture of what he was trying to lead. The professional aspect of the movie is amazing as it is relatively low budget. It is dependent on scares without effects (mainly due to budget constraints), but still creates a thrilling atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Stephen King said this was one of his favorite movies and I can't seriously explain to him! It's one of my favorite horror movies and will always be. This is my favorite Fullmoon Movie and has been ever since I first bought a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The money is well spent! I own both VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
