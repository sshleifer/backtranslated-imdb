Ponyo is a beautiful animated movie with some dark undertones. It has a childhood story of longing and love with ecological consequences, but it is not the sermon. Hayao Miyazaki has melted Andersen's little mermaid with Japan's native myths and his trademark steam punk aircraft in fancy, and the result is very rewarding. There are some scary moments of ocean storm and flood, but they are exciting, not horrific. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to drive the waves along the coast, drive on a jellyfish like a lift, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.
