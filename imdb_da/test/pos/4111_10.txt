This musical has a deep meaning, which is only appreciated by few. The wise can see wisdom contained in the most called folly. <br /> <br /> This music may regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It's about a country "far away from it all", where "living things have room to grow." Its people are "living and growing together" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age. <br /> <br /> The texts help us to recognize the relativity of this "world that spins around" and to "look inside yourself; is where the truth is always." The absolute level of consciousness is more real than the senses of the senses. everlasting world. <br /> <br /> I've been searching for the video for years. When I find it or it comes out in DVD, it will help "share the joy" of being in "Shangri-la" again. Burt Bacharach's music and Hal David's lyrics made a masterpiece in turbulent times that are now ready to be fully appreciated. <br /> <br /> May this CD inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon" or recognize it when "peace of mind" has found you. - LostHorizon.org
