This movie is amazing. You will never laugh harder. It's a goal. No, I think it's ... yes it's ... A BOOB! This movie will be more fun by the other - just as Jackie Khan's character finally dies in his last battle scene. This movie is velly successful seekwet as treasha! Congratulations on purchasing or renting this. You will never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was in love with Kung-Fu action flicks. If you're looking for a great movie in rich with great production value, good or even mediocre acting and good special effects ... that's not the movie. If you're looking for fun and timeless entertainment, you should choose it for a dollar, and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.
