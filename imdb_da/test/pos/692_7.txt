This is an excellent tub dump from the war. <br /> <br /> John Mills leads a fine casting of regular British B movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack on a fictitious enemy battleship. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it's a good pace and also well positioned considering that a war was taking place at that time. If that is something, it turns out how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the film is in real submarines. Things are narrow and claustrophobic. The actors look appropriately ugly and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic small details such as keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine room activities. This is probably the first movie in which dirt (and a dead German) is blown from the torpedo tube to trick an enemy destroyer. And that's the only time I've seen a part of the ship that is delayed by a sinking - a high-risk game if ever there was one. <br /> <br /> I'm a little skeptical about whether a submarine or not could make its way through a wire rope. The submerged speed was barely twice the human walking speed, and the grid would have had a great deal of "giving". In addition, the engineer was on the same workstation and operated the same levers both on the surface and submerged. It also seems inappropriate because either diesel or electric motors were used and they were in different parts of the ship - or I was told. <br /> <br /> There was a little too much shore-side drama to my liking. But then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to think about their behavior, as it could have a negative impact on morale and thus the war effort. These niggles aside are a rather entertaining little adventure. Today, movies of this vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon, while much more modern and subordinate films enjoy prime time. But then; It is no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (for many of them guilty of conscience) or our own left-wing fascists (none of whom have fought for the freedoms they now take for granted). <br /> <br /> As a submarine movie, it is a unique collection item. Better than 'The Enemy Below', I think, but less demonstrative. Not as authentic as 'Das Boot' in any way, but not as rough.
