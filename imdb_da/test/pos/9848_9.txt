I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be careful because of what I'm discussing, although I don't really think I'm giving away anything important. Any "surprises" are really insignificant for the success of this movie or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Though it is not without very small errors, it is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, insecurity and the choices people make about their lives. Still, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly discrete comedies that are woven throughout. Too much of the film develops at a rather relaxed pace, but it doesn't work slowly since the film draws one into it and into the characters' lives, and initially it's pretty bright. Some have commented that much of the movie looks slow, but it is such a wonderful depiction of the life of such sympathetic characters that one could see it almost infinitely. As it progresses, the movie becomes more emotional and moves all the way to the end, and the progression is handled wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Finally, some of them decide to rob a bank, and though it may be hard to believe, it's next to that point. It is a wonderful addition to emphasize the love that these friends have for each other while accentuating humor and adding a little more irony to the movie. And although having a bunch of old boys is nothing original to rob a bank, the context and the details are quite original, and they make it wonderful, which makes it really fun too. When Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "pamper" the fact that he is old. As I said, most of the other comedies are pretty low key, but still very humorous, so I ran all the time. <br /> <br /> The actors are probably the right key to this movie. They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and depict them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or small details about the characters' personalities, which are drawn smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care and interact with each other. It succeeds so well because of them, and if smaller players had the roles the movie could have failed. <br /> <br /> Yellow Yellow is not without grief, but it simply gives the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. In fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love from so rich characters that it is ultimately a very warm warming, satisfying and even happy movie despite its sadness. I could see it again and again.
