This movie succeeded as it was shown. It's a short tragic movie. Though my choice of movies is the one that really develops characters and their relationships, this movie is meant to just give a taste that leaves you with the "what's happening next" factor. After seeing it, I really wanted more, more of the letters behind the story, what influences they had on making them the people they were. I think what the decision makers had been thinking of looking at the audience. The action is amazing. There are not many lines in the movie, so their body language, facial expressions and overall presence should be powerful enough to hold a scene. Both Franco and Miner have that element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to do this, of course they say they believed in this movie and wanted to be separate from it, and for that I appreciated the movie for what it was. I'm also glad I own it so I can share it with other people who would never know it existed.
