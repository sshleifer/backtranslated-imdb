DRIVING LESSONS is a small movie that carries on you. What initially seems to be a bit fluffy nonsense comedy The British style is basically a very good story of age and the need for a significant friendship for both the young and the elderly. The author Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') instructs her own play and the result is a coherent, progressively engaging story filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors. <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint standing alone as a developing actor after the 'Harry Potter' series) is a quiet, pure little poetic seventeen year old who lives with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid evangelical do-godmother (Laura Linney) in a home where "needy people" like the murderous cross-link Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton) takes precedence over family relationships: by the way, the mother has an affair with priest Peter (oliver milburn) using legs as her cover! Sad Ben, among other things, tries to learn how to drive. His mother is a poor teacher and decides that he needs professional lessons and needs a job to help pay for the needs of poor Mr Fincham. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elder has been an actress who is as tough as any character ever created. She hires legs and fireworks begins. Through a series of events, including a camping trip that Evie demands, they teach the two life lessons that lack each other's nature: Ben learns self-respect and self-confidence, and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to release her stagy facade and be the dear man she has hid. Julie Walters, who always offers the best skills to shop in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is incredibly wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenging future age Ben. The chemistry between the two is as tender as in the classic film 'Harold and Maude'. Laura Linney, as always, is a great actress who plays a role, quite differently from her usual repertoire. And the support molding is a panorama of fine characterizations. This movie is a wonderful surprise and you are sure to warm your heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and action - and message! Grady Harp
