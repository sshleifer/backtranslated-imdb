Where the Rivers North River is a famous story of two peoples struggle to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to enjoying the movie as entertainment, I also learned a little about rural life in New England back in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> Kinematics captured the rapid beauty of Northern Vermont and set the scene while music brought the film to life. Very well done for a low budget, locally produced film. I found Michael J. Fox's character the weakest in the movie, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal transform two of the finest shows I've seen for a long time. I was sad, she didn't get a nod as best actress that year (I suppose the movie was too "a little" a movie to consider).
