A bunch of most unpleasant and grossly unpleasant teenagers go to a creepy, remote-controlled, rundown old sleeve that is near a cemetery to attend all that goes on. The widespread Halloween party is hosted by freaky occult obsessed oddball Mimi Kinkade and her vacuous boy sibling friend Linnea Quigley. The loutish, profane, beer-guzzling, sex-happy dipstick dimwits hold a s√©ance as a joke (very bad idea, because the desolate old dive is obviously said to be haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, the unwanted exposure awakens those who are certainly murky and hostile evil spirits who cruelly kill and possess the majority of the children, and make them ugly, trapped, itchy, boiled face-murderous ghouls that propagate the usual pigs chaos throughout the duration of A particularly long, dark and appalling night of pure terror. Yep, this is essentially your deepest powerful graphic and unsustainable wall-to-wall cheap shock-saved "Evil Dead" rehash, filled with closed, no easy way out in claustrophobic single self-confined setting, outrageously exaggerated splatter set pieces, an unnoticed pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, a total sensation of gloomy-blooded wicked nightmare and live-in-face manic careening cinematography (the expected headlong rush-inducing hyperactive hand-held camera work, smooth, sinuous tracking shots, crazily Titled camera angles, even the camera on a dolly makes a gracefully sliding 180 degree figure eight). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenneys slim, secure, stylish direction holds the extremely wireless and derivative procedure that thaws with a quick clip; In addition, the Tenny film gives an attractive polished look and effectively creates a truly immensely energetic and enthusiastic grotesque, spooky ooga booga carnival community. <br /> <br /> But Steve Johnson's wonderful gory and imaginative make-up effects are true star of the show. Blood-thirsty highlights include obnoxious obese Hal Havins (who played a similar annoying obesity a ** role in the immortal "Sorority Babes in Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama" at the same time) with his tongue bitten, Quigley pushing a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!) and gouging a guy's eyes while she loves him (double yow!), a libidinous teen couple gets offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (chick has her neck broken while the guy has his arm cut off), Kinkade puts his hands on the fire, and in the film's most unpleasant scene, a mighty old man has his neck slit inside out after eating a piece of apple twisted with razor blade. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there is Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and unbridled demon dance, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and exciting cuts that Kinkade choreographed himself. Okay, so this total amount does not correspond to anything more than a completely thoughtless and pointless, though quite nicely fitted and comfortable vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy scary flick junk, but if you're in the mood for entertaining brain-dead lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerful crass and the juvenile dross does the trick fine.
