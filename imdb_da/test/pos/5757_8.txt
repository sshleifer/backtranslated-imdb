The bottom has been my favorite sitcom ever since I saw it at t.v and the movie is even better if your bottom fan i say this is a must buy !!! the plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called guesthouse paradise, but not everyone goes right for those customers leave until a famous actress is going to be trying there best to impress her but not all well go right this is an upbringing to British cinema so buy this and you will wet yourself with laughter. also starring Simon Peggi (Shaun of the Dead) and also bill neigh (love actually) it may not do well in the cashier's office or by the appearance of it on this website, but do not listen to them buy this and I swear you will love it
