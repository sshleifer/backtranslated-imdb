Lastly, this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing thought is, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total attack on the senses. Looks like a movie from Lynch's mind (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a bit of "begotten". What this guy does for his pregnant sister is without faith, but it did it again, or is his left and right brain making battle. It is the main theme of this work of art to draw a fine line between imagination and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the brain, which dreams and fantasizes, overtakes the reasoning and the logical left side. And the music in this movie is incredible, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Although this movie is quite shocking and rather obnoxious in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex), you'll ever see in a movie I considered it a work of art and loved it. And that music still amazes me, I have to try to find the soundtrack if it is available. Seeing "unconscious cruelty" is a real event and not something that the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds, this is a must-have. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful about buying this movie because some prints have fogged on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially the Japanese release copies
