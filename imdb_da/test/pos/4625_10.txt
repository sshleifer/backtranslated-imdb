I had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant movie at a preview screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see it. Pleasure is not the feeling you are left with as the credits. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a movie that not only tackles a stigma followed by young people, but all of them. Heads are insulation. It's not just placing the film's last galvanizing scene on a pedestal over the others, but it's rather important to see it as the culmination. And therefore it is important to realize what it represents both you and the viewer and the people directly performed by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a soft picture, but the way Mr Thalluri handles it is an object of deep dignity, and it is no barred approach that acts as credit for that message. <br /> <br /> I don't think movies like 2:37 should be scaled by voices of favor. It should rather be recommended for those seeking purpose in their viewing. <br /> <br /> An excellently crafted portrait of innocence lost. And a master stroke for one as yet unmatched talent. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed.
