Wolfgang Peterson is on the line and occasionally a really whitewashed trip, even though we may once or twice feel like we've been down on similar roads before. How could one not, when Clint Eastwood, right after (supposedly) close the book on his western legacy, probably closes one on his gritty detective pictures (does not count blood work in there). But there is more to it because Eastwood's character, here a hard-bitten demon-ridden and tough as a nail-secret service agent, has a slightly charming side to him, even the more romantic side that one should never see in the pictures where he burst his mark lines. There are some complexities going on here that do not depend on the usual swagger, and it is worth telling how such a possibly constructed back story (not afraid of Kennedy being murdered in 63) is done somewhat credibly between the rest of his persona, who more than likely hides his wounds - most of the time. Eastwood goes to town to make a big presence in the movie, and under these circumstances, the sign seems to be tailored to him. <br /> <br /> But there would be a risk that his role in the movie is a bit conventional (we still get the 'Harry' type scenes of him who is smarter - and as smart-assover everyone else in space and being scolded and told to go by the top brass, here a chief of staff, including here protecting a president that (wise) we never really see or know it at all. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is kind of undercooked, if some machismo laughs, would make the picture a little under-pared if the other quasi-Dirty Harry aspect didn't come into the picture: an indelible crook. This time there is some extra Hollywood excitement, but brillaintly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves), with the "John Booth" character, played in an Oscar nominated performance by John Malkovich as one described more like a predators than an assassin. There are ways that this might go wrong with the Eastwood character, but Malkovich may be bumping into some of his former villainous models by being extremely cool and unoccupied (there is the devastating, cringe-worthy scene where he kills the bank's counter and her roommate) as his past is revealed, there is still the element of "what the hell is with this guy" that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. It is a classic Malkovich performance that is absolutely creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism. It is also, except for the conventional points, just a beautifully crafted image from Peterson and company, and they become beautiful close to Don Siegel's spunky mass malism. But Peterson also has a couple of movie tricks up his sleeve that had me laughing at times; anytime you sit in such a blatant but exciting tribute to the Vertigo jump from roof to ceiling on the tower, completely hanging from the joint, "the twist - it still gives some tremors down the back. There are also phone calls Between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depth of the cat and the mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs of Hithcock, but eventually, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and sharp formalism of the climax, it is also a signage in some ways and everything is quite realized to give the audience a good amount to consider, at least in the suspense movie sense, Eastwod is a good leader, Russo plays the female possible love-interest sincere and mature, and Malkovich is the top of There are also a few notable supporting roles as well, and a fine studio score in there, one of the better films from 1993.
