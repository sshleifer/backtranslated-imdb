Don't want to repeat what everyone else has noticed, I will just say this: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says they loved Curly's best ... but I want to put BRIDELESS GROOM against any of the other Stooges shorts. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable. <br /> <br /> The off-key song student ... Christine McIntire's "Cousin Basil" and of course, Emil Sitka's JP highlights, but only about Stooges' impeccable timing and great writing too! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
