This movie is extremely fun and enjoyable with appropriate, fun and experienced casts. I find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in different scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, has done a good job of being fun in many parts of the film with Tom Selleck, who is incredibly different from many of his other films. The mood of this movie is greasy, making various exaggerations within many scenes, especially the beginning bits. Joan Cusack is also remarkably fun and exaggerated; And the same goes for all the other casts. This movie has many elements of goofy humor and is fun if you want to laugh.
