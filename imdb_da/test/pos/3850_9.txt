I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7-year-old son is starting to get into them, so we've built a whole collection and it's one of my favorites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago, and we must see it a dozen times ago! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive, but there is more to a movie than that. Big characters, Phil Harris steals the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar Butler not far behind. The music is fantastic - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to "Everybody wants to be Cat" it says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as much fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this movie, except for a reluctance to cats! And yes, it takes a few characters from "101 Dalmations" and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (it's been a long time since I've seen it so I can't compare them) and while "101 Dalmatians" are better at Some ways, for me "The Aristocats" are far more comfortable. Isn't that what these movies are about? <br /> <br /> Apart from "Peter Pan" (now it's a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his grinning 41-year-old father loves it, so you can't ask much more about a family movie. <br /> <br /> Superb!
