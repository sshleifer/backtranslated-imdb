As a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the film, it seemed that Natalie was the mother, and Susan was the mother. Susan's character was making bad decisions and kept burning because of it. I heard there was a love scene that involved Natalie and a guy (he's outside Providence), but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think so well. I think a love scene would have ruined the movie's tone. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have the ability to choose good movies because he hasn't seen her in a bad movie yet. So any movie that has Natalie Portman will undoubtedly be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 10.7
