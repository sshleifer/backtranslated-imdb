In this early Fulci work, the instructor shows his most common side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable explanation of the genre. Personally, I think he has been unfairly vicious throughout his career as an aesthetic of gore. It is a rather clever procedural and surprised me with its sub-abstract rich narrative, showing his mistrust of tiny small town mentality and police inefficiency as well as the catastrophic ideals of the Catholic Church, the latter of which seemed to have cut this film to its knees, as it was released and could have given the director another direction so early. The comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative for this film in its ruling "mystery", but the doctrine and puppetry he utilizes is used here especially in the scene where a false accused killer is meaningless lynched by a group of men in a cemetery and left to death in a show of silly and obsolete vigilantism, choreographed expertise for the modern tunes of a dietetic radio. Another example was the final scene (which was truly amazing), where a strikingly beautiful priest falls from a cliff, and the used puppet is markedly in a medium closeup that highlighted its demonic appearance and overt cruelty. With regard to his later works, Fulci also curiously invokes the idea of ​​modernity seized on the hamlet, which holds on to its anachronistic superstition and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is just that, a picturesque idea of ​​supernatural evil that never ends with manifesting from voodoo dolls while making the witch no more than a disturbed woman. Another thing I liked was that he adds these character layers by making a bourgeois bitch into an ambiguous figure - is it the one who destroys the priest fear of his departments and perhaps more narrative to himself? This giallo makes himself one of Fulci's more personal and material films, as we actually get a fair flow of ideas from him.
