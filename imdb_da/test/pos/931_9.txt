And there aren't many in the history of cinema. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in humanity and in life. But just to say it can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of the damned judge and the twentish but clever model. Perhaps the old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated - this is the new couple with the young judge after the accident -. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to see each of these faces. Kieslowski loved people and it is quite clear in the way the camera treats the actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr. Tringtantant is perfect It's not just this movie, but the downbeat "Don't Kill" and "A Story of Love" that you can think of contemporary cinema as a way of expressing the artist's view. Pity American public-the average one - couldn't see these movies. At least they are not in the Maltese dictionary. And even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas
