I finally got a chance to get in and compare the two versions of this movie that are currently running. Firstly, it called good old scummy, shabby Embassy VHS edition SCREAMERS, and then a new fully restored Italian DVD of everyone's new favorite media business, American advertising "men turned in" is, as everyone says, completely misleading and guiding for a Roger Cormanized take on what would otherwise be a superior fantasy-adventure thriller for adults. The complete Italian version is a somewhat bubbly, well-designed and deliberately stimulated take on "Island of Dr. Moreau" and there is nothing wrong with it. It is a sumptuous, beautiful Euro Horror excursion with a brain, good planning, character development, placement competition, temporal costumes and sets etc. But I have to admit that the 14-year-old knucklehead weed puffer still lurks somewhere inside me got a bigger kick out of the more shabby, sleazy and unkempt Roger Corman version, which has something good over the top, a flashy but exquisite opening segment, and then most of Martino's original film, albeit slightly shortened to make room for Roger's idea of ​​entertainment. The pacing was somewhat faster, the shocks closer together, and you see as much of Mrs Bach's amazing form as you do in the expanded Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still don't have much of an idea of ​​what the specific story is about: There are a number of plot phrases and random characters that were difficult to keep track of. A local voodoo subplot didn't help much and it's fun how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the crazy scientist ... Maybe a few views are okay. I want to say this: Fans of the movie should take advantage of one of these PAL imports and watch what is actually a movie rather than just another frothy old home video - the widescreen shot compositions again reveal that Martino had an eye to fill his screen with interesting things. No one gets their heads skinned as in the SCREAMERS print, but it is still interesting things, and once again proof that although his standards may have been rather limited to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman was a new good trashy fun when he had Made it for him, and side by side these are actually better movies than they may be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
