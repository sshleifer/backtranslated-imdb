Intense, fun, witty, and more than any social comedy about ways to grow dating, and it's results - be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged couples two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party strengthens Nicholson to rethink the relationship and start dancing other people so she will not feel so unspoiled when it comes to sexual experience. This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and necessary at this time of clumsy and discouraging comedy while containing your usual selection of comic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex prison ... very annoying), who himself seems to have the right feeling for this heart felt comment. <br /> <br /> The movie is going to be filming these days, showing that guys are sensitive in heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight-forward eyes, while the woman is the timid street browsers who will stop at nothing for joy. Guys will be grateful for the message made for guys with self-respect, but it is easy to assume that most men who watch this movie will use the message of male sensitivity to cover any error or trait that a woman may find offensive. Still, the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for the male driver, especially those from Mohr, Richter, and find the director in a cameo as a salesman! The females are by far the most promiscuous as they talk about nothing but pleasure and what it would be like ... with another. However, they have amicable features even though they are covered by the image of sex-driven kittens. Very funny. <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows some of the ensemble in various interventions. Richter meets a stressful divorce (a very remarkable achievement of the always reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope, separated from a son who hates her to split with her father. As the two go deeper into a relationship, people's interest is revealed, and both comedy and tragedy of divorce and re-study are being studied. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Mohr and Nicholson have become too deeply overhead to see what's coming next, and it's up to what they've learned about each other and to decide for themselves. what will come next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. Wallodorski's direction is very well emulated when the characters learn to meet each other for everything that has happened ... with the right end. <br /> All in all, this movie has to be released nationwide, and I hope it's up to some Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anywho, this movie is a no hits miss, gives it all, you have a romantic sex farce, appears very mature and aesthetic. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie!
