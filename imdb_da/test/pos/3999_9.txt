What a movie! I have always seen the Asian style shooting, and this movie doesn't disappoint at all! Photography is breath-taking, from stunning landscapes to swirls of colors. The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The end is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only remark is that they might have shown a little deeper connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women. But all in all, it's an excellent movie!
