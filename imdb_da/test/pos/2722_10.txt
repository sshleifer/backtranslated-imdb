From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", the Apes Sen have traveled far. If the first one goes down in history as a pure debut of a debutant, the latter will surely cut a special place like a "mature" movie. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can't imagine being excited and moving at the same time. Thrilled to see the instructor's ingenuity and flexibility in exhibiting seriously challenging situations and moving through the sensitivity that echoes throughout the film. It's not a movie that just makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how hard life has to be for schizophrenia', but makes you ask a far deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Then, having done a brilliant job of highlighting this supreme fact of our existence, we all somehow try to live in the world of our own beliefs, trying to run after mirages called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Sene's magic, along with the depiction of a wild mind, has created many small nuances of human relationships, as they maintain stress and strain. The fact that we sometimes lose calm, break down, take wrong choices, be haunted by guilt, behave selfishly, etc., captured with extreme adroitness by Sen. She showed the cruel dilemma that Shabana had to do with her entire life, having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a man and children for themselves. And in the act of always being next to her sister, always being a strong persona, providing support, judging, and so forth, she unknowingly interrupted some of the oxygen the sister needed to flourish. Isn't this a very hard truth that we sometimes, in an attempt to do the best for someone, stifle their assertiveness and end up harming their self-esteem? Of course, Konona and Shabana's plays deserve laurels as always, because the ingredients were not so good that the dish could not have been so extraordinary. The monkeys Then once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who yearn for some "food for thoughts". Bravo!
