Anyone who identifies this as a simple rip-off of 'Elephant' - there are no other comments you can make toward the movie on its own as an individual movie (regardless of its apparent similarities to other films). <Br /> <br /> All those who question the validity of the movie - in terms of stereotypical characters (mandatory gay, jock, disabled child, etc.) - I'm not sure how long it has been since you were at school - But no matter how amateurish the actor can be - the events that go are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who ignore the movie as being so simple: only six teens with the ordinary teenage anxiety pushing one over the edge ... stopped anyone thinking and noting that the girl who took her life was not one of the six !! As a comment points out - she had the screen time of maybe 2 min max (excluding the last scenes). I think the point in the movie is not just a matter of teenage anxiety and how far it can take anyone - but also that it is not apparently obvious that there is always the danger of committing such an act (suicide) ...
