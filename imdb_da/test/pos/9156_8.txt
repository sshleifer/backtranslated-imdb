This show was really good in many ways, even though it was an atypical western with the hero (?), Who was driving a motorcycle over a horse because of the 1914 setting, very "late" for a western who usually wont Set between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy about its cancellation at that time, but didn't really look at it in its time at NBC. When I came to see it and love it was a decade later when I was in the Army stationed in Germany, and it was shown every week from the beginning of the armed television. Back then, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I also always want to think of her as Nichols' boyfriend. In many ways, Nichols was much like Maverick; both were much more attracted to being rich in little effort than they fought for. It was in the little TV magazine they distributed on the PX (not really an authorized version of "TV Guide", but made to look like it as close as possible without getting into trouble with copyright) that I first learned the real story behind the cancellation. I really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been as if they had really made it as planned. Of course, when this show was done, the "Western era" of television had been in decline for about a decade; One day I hope to write that the "reality era" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" still ran, they both approached their ends and it had been years since a new Western had really caught on; I think this trend did a lot to keep "Nichols" back, and that was the main reason why NBC leaders doubted that it would ever find a large audience. But for me, a good western, unlike a show in modern times, is somewhat timeless, just like other "period" shows; changing fashion and the like doesn't matter to make them look more "dated" than they should be, and I think seeing this show 10 years after it was produced is really what brought this point home for me. Also, this show is an early pairing of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who really are one of the all-time big sidekicks, and not just in Western.
