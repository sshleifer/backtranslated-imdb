Some say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this flick, but I don't feel guilty of it. You can tell the whole cast and the crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 does not go well with some people. Right from the start, you can see that this movie becomes cheesy, and it has absolutely an amateur look. Well, if you get the privilege of watching the movie, remember Jack Frost 2: Revenge of Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now because I can't fill ten lines here are some amazing scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach had great deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree trying to drop ice bulbs on one of them. He was missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of lard. The last one was stuck in the eyes with forceps. <br /> <br /> The second major was where two surfers stoners hang near a frozen rod. One of them gets the tongue fixed on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back and rips his tongue off and says "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Now you see it yourself. <br /> <br /> And of course, the snowball kids kicked ass. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Infinite Stars
