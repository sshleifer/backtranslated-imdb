I was a schoolgirl when I first saw this movie. The next day I knew that all students in our form looked at it and everyone was fascinated by the movie I was. I think the same situation was in all kinds of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and would like to see more. I think the comparison with "Back to the Future" or other Sci-Fi movies is not appropriate. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of faith in peaceful science results, full of faith in the beautiful future of our world. It is not just the film, but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and results. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (creation of the year) and in 2084 (where a schoolgirl Kolya Gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova was from). The year is now 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film have not yet been realized. Such as "Mielofon" (a device that can read thoughts about any animal and human), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as picnicking at weekends), creating and launching the satellites as homework for students, easy to run airplanes (as completely replaced cars), biorobots, "historical identification" of any kind of material or creature done in a few minutes and many others. Meanwhile, some of them became much more realistic today than they did in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also shows typical Russian schoolboys and schoolgirls (and makes it so natural!). With their ingenuity, curiosity, humor, dreaminess. For example, look at Fima Korolyov, you could find such character in almost every form of every school in the Soviet Union, and similar character was also in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... I myself, as well as many of my classmates, fell in love at first sight with her! By the way, later an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was just as much influenced by the movie as people watching TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and "new versions "of the song from the movie and even the film itself was made later and spread on television and on the internet. All of them are not even comparable to the original. I don't even have to comment on them, my comment is just about the original. Then ask the original and enjoy it!
