The history of united China must be popular. Jet Li's Hero made the king's murder popular. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years earlier. It originated the incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the King's lover, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the king could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> However, he is unable to complete the mission anyway, as the King knew about him in advance. It was a beautiful story with massive military operations, and of course another chance to see Li Gong.
