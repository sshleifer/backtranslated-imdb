Hilarious movie, I was happy to see it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in lots of hard pine roles, epic swords and romances. It was fun to see him with an international cast and some real miserable looking pair of gloves. If I remember, it was also called in English, which made things even more fun. (like watching John Wayne speak Turkish).
