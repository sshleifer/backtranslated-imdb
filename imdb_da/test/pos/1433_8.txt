A truly outstanding look at the world and the reality of being a heroin addict. The movie is one that will hit too close to the home of those involved in the drug culture and know what is (or is about) a heroin addict really is. Good movie that will never be outdated. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set are the Preminger way of showing how gloomy a JUNKIE world can be. Worth a visit - a training of varieties. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain that a junkie lives in.
