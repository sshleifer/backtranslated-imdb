A touching documentary that puts a human face on the 9/11 tragedy by showing how a small community gathers in honor of two high school friends lost on that day. The film mixes Chris and Tom's life through interviews with family and friends and excerpts of old pictures. Through their reminders we see two lives tragically cut down. The film also documents how an inspiring memorial through a series of coincidences was produced through many efforts, both known and unknown to the two victims. Through the laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. These films evoke many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of the admiration of the human spirit that is unmoved by tragedies.
