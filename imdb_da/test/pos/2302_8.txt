This is a film by Oshima, the director of the infamous "In The Realms of the Senses", a movie that was sexually sold and uncontrolled controversially, it was banned for a while. This film is originally in 1895 in Japan and stars the very beautiful Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who moves in nature. The man Toyoji comes to her when she sleeps and seduces her, though soon she is quite willing to be seduced. Soon they have an affair and a plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do and throw him into a well. But they didn't count on the ghost from the dead man who joked Seki and others in the village! This film is visually amazing, the use of shadows highlights this tale of murder for passion. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially good in her role. It is sexual at times, but not as "in the kingdom of sin". Some of what follows is up to our imagination. I found this movie to get a sense of mood that makes it very visible. A little scary, but it goes with the territory. I would recommend this.
