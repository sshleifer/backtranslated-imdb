The surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a good show like this and worse for everyone, just to let it be half full. NBC or another must provide Surface with at least one additional season to complete. It is as if NBC gave you a book to read and halfway through it, they decide to take it away from you and then you can never figure out the end. I just want to see what's happening to everyone and most importantly see what's happening to Nim. I think I can say for sure if most Surface fans are that we will save Nim! Nim has taken away all our hearts and then NBC just cuts them in half. Come on NBC, just give Surface another season!
