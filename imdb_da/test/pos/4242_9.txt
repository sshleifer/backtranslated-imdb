Chucky (the murderous doll from "Child's Play" and 2 crappy followers) is dead. But his ex-boyfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his leftovers and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then SHE is killed by circumstances that are terrible to enter, and has its soul set in another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a lovely couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again ... Much better than that sounds. After the last two successors to "Child's Play" (both were horrible) I was expecting the worst, but it was actually a lot of fun. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how could it?) And the lines and situations are actually quite fun. There are also a few very precious murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the movie never stops moving. The movie also has a few things that are usually not found in a horror movie - a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence where Stable has his shirt completely off to show his muscle body . John Ritter also has a nice cameo like a sheriff. The play is good - Stable is young, very nice and sympathetic; Heigl doesn't have much to do, but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are fun as the murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he answers, "But I'm made of rubber!" The special effects are good (not miserable CGI here), and this is one of the few horror films that mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Worth to see. I give it a 9.
