Real love, I really enjoyed and LOVED this movie. It was fun, fun and inspiring. I just watched it on DVD. How did I miss this, it's a winner! I think Flex was "That Guy". I wanted to marry him. This was my first time seeing him as a straight lead man and he pulls it off. I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was also a Felicity head. A fearless woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for giving women a color range in your work and she looks great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as Nana. This sweet romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh, and the new comedian Marcus Patrick is worth surprising ladies ... Real love. karen
