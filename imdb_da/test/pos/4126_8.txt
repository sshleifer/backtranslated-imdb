It happened to me while the film's final scene froze to reveal the little details of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people alive today who were in the place of Clearlake, Iowa, who remembers living. It must be a scary memory, lent even more poignancy of the lyrics of "American Pie" as it celebrates the day the music died. The world has lost some enormous talent the day life goes short before their prime, and one can only wonder what could have been if the trio of musicians who died that day had survived to create an even bigger musical heritage. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie today some thirty years after it's the original theatrical release. Thirty years I have some problems wrapping my mind around it. I had forgotten a lot of it while I remembered some of the little things like cricket in the wall that were immortalized with the band's name. But most of all I remember the music. It's hard just to sit there and not start tapping into "Oh Boy" or "That's the Day" and just wonder where the threat to our morals might have actually come off with those tunes. I'm with Buddy on that score at least, how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? Fun, how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society - The Beatles, Motown, Disco, and a variety of other forms of music. We still listen and dance to the beat, so I suppose they couldn't have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another takeaway from the movie I had forgotten. It was here that I learned to put a phone on the table, as the person at the other end didn't see things in my way. I've done it a number of times over the years, but had now forgotten the source. Well, I should be good for another thirty years or so now. You must definitely give Gary Busey credit for his portrayal of Buddy Holly. When he saw him today, one could never imagine him as the slender rocker with the horn's brown glasses, but it was a tour of the force characterization and performance that earned Busey an Oscar nod. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as Buddy's band members, though their characters take up much of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were sigued in the picture, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis, without ever staying in their presence. <br /> <br /> I always want to be a fan and fan of music from Fifties and Sixties - 'oldies' they call them now. It also guesses me a bit of an oldie, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music story that now makes it the big screen. The only thing that reinforces the idea that I will continue to enjoy the music until the day I die.
