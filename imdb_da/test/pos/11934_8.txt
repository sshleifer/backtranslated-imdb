I first watched this movie as a year and a half ago, and I loved it, I decided to get the DVD last year for my birthday. It has the right amount of excitement, action and drama. This movie is about prep school called Regis School and its full rebellious children, where a child William Tepper (Sean Astin) has difficulty adjusting due to previous refusals from other schools because they could not control his rebellious action and now The Regis School commits several acts of a rebellion where the school is being taken over by terrorists on a random day and as the real reason is because the leader Luis Cali's (Andrew Divoff) father has been sent to jail and the leader will do everything including Kill the students, put bombs and etc. to get his father back. <br /> <br /> Alongside William Tepper are his rebellious friends at Regis School, one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), where this guy holds a troubled past to live in a mafia family and be sent to Regis School on Because of hating his father for who he is and which he now has to deal with these terrorists, the school is taking over, so William, Joey and those friends should tie together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really amazing and I think people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie, they would say "Die Hard" and even if I would agree with them, they must recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, it probably had my heart beat because students are my age and I would be afraid to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... But overall is this movie really a good 112 minutes worth of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it ... i would buy it! I highly recommend it with a lot of hype! 8.10
