I laughed so hard most of the time when I had people laughing at me because they couldn't hear my laughter. I literally fell out of my seat at a certain time. I am a bartender and bouncer to live in the real world (note my use of the term real world, unfortunately it always has to come first) and when I tell someone I play RPGs it is usually followed by one of two questions: 1. What does D & D think? I played it back in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I've seen or a group forever! Have room for another? Very rarely do people not know what D&D and Gaming are. <br /> <br /> Having been told, almost all people watching this movie can get something out of it. Although you are not a Gamer, there are chances that there is something in your life, you "Geek Out" about that can be fun in a light hearted way, and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this flick. It's just light hearted happiness in the hour and a half.
