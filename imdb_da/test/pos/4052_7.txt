A boat builder in a sleepy town in Maine is out of life and the lives of all those soon (soon before) workers and families are disturbed. The biggest disappointment is that the two stars - Bates and Bridges - only have small parts. <br /> <br /> Interesting, but nothing you would see twice. <br /> <br />
