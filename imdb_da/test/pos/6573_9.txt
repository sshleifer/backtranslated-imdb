When I first saw the poster of this movie, I discarded it as another low-budget movie that targeted the youth. After a few days when it finally made it to the theaters, one of my friends told me it was good. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the ad that Anand was going to be broadcast on television and the moment finally came when I jumped channels and for a moment I stopped to see and that was it , I ended up watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And now 3 years later I would have watched the movie at least 7-8 times and I really don't see movies again and again !! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different as all Telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 games. <br /> <br /> It's a simple movie, a little slow but a very gripping script, there are no loose ends in the movie, very well-known dialogues, which is really hard to find. <br /> <br /> Music is both classic and soothing, good reproductions of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in BGmusic, through the movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves a mention. Editing is not licking but sufficient for a romantic one like this. But what really blows you out in this movie is two things - 1. Each scene has been treated with utmost respect by the now famous Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful lyrics of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And another thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of her success attributed to Sunitha, to lend her such a beautiful voice, really tell you, the voice does wonders to the other actors are equal so good, Raja in the title character and the little girl, and how she shouts when she gets a new dog. In the end, I can tell you that this movie is soon on its way to being another classic with the old classic romantic, along with Kammula's second classical-romantic piece, Godavari.
