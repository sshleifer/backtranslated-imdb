I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics for me who based the movie. After reading the book, it is impressed by it, although it is a kind of literature that you don't really like (similar to Hubert Selby's writing), I expected to be shocked, but the effect was more subtle than this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. There are many scenes that focus entirely on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine few actresses who would do well, with so much respect for their own reputation or image. There is this cold, distance, cruelty and at the same time there is this helplessness, evil and pain. There is a person in control and controlled at the same time. Perhaps it is not realistic - even if you read the newspaper, you read much worse than this - but there is a truth to what is very hard to bear. I think it's an excellent movie, but I didn't like to watch it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wanted it to end. BTW, her male counterpart is also good (and I also think well chosen).
