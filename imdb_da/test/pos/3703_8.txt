"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in its narrative aspects. But it delivers a completely enjoyable story along with a magnificent filmography. The narrative structure is arranged around two narrative axes, one of which nests the other, each of which has elements that relate to and exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good mix of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a sign in itself). The action is great, and for that we are due to the credit of the new director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; So when you become familiar with them, you can perceive their feelings without saying anything themselves. I can't say I liked this picture because of all the hype it generated (in Costa Rica), but rather because of the way it really achieves by showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interferes with the balance of people's lives. Hopefully, Caribe will establish a reference to future projects in Costa Rica, as it is a very good example of good filmmaking.
