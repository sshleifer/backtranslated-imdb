Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately the number of people versus the number of people who are not way is unbalanced. I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans, and the only reason I could do this is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> For one how someone can listen to "Stair to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin is beyond me, but playing guitar and not as Side ... It is Like being a Christian and not like Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucking!" and I was like, "Oh yes, see this!" After approx. 2 minutes to see the page looking through the "White Summer / Black Mountain Side" he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about the Zeppelin page. Incase you have not followed running metaphor I call this DVD, the Bible for Led Zeppelin. Held high by the followers and used as a convert to the unwashed Gentiles. <br /> <br /> A course missing some things like "Over The Hills and Far Away", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really didn't need 2 version of "Whole Lotta Love" but what in hell I'll take them. Because there is nothing besides "The song remains the same" to compare this also I gave it a 10 and even if there was more to compare it also I would still have given it a 10.
