"Mr. Bug Goes To Town" was the last major achievement that Fleischer Studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the help of Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as much as the score of the image of Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White Disney's "atmospheric music" is great and a treat for the ears. <br /> <br /> The layout and scene of the picture were years before it's time, and once again Fleischer's background artists changed themselves. tech-colored beauty of the movie cannot be denied, and while the Hoppity grasshopper is the star, the sign Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito is stealing the image. Jack Mercer (Popeye fame) is priceless Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) Guy Lombardo ... and a highlight vocalist in his band ... doing his usual pleasant work in the role of Dick Dickinsen. br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for all the wrong ons. Fleischer Studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product. The movie is tuneful, the story is good for all ages, and the final scenes of the mistakes that encrypt their lives on a rising skyscraper are some of the best scenes and animations of any animated film past and present. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out on this wonderful hand-drawn movie. Also, appreciate the title sequence with the most comprehensive example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3-D sterioptic process that took four months to build and employ 16,000 small glass panes in the "electrified" buildings in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out on Mr. Bug Goes Town ... aka Hoppity Goes to Town. I will bet that you will be bug eyed on the results!
