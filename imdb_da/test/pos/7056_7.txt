... The reason I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a brilliant summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mediocre in a lasting way, making the sign of the permanent relief of ridicule. Pranks take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall boys will be able to look back and laugh, as they have been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it is actually pretty good that everyone still remains friends in the end! <br /> <br /> It's an extra special bonus when ringmaster of all these jolly japes is Bill Murray. For me, he's still looked like comedy god without a buddy when he gets the chance to cut loose. No one is better at creating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. The tone of the entire movie has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the Murray way of getting ready for the day. Everything is silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is having a lot of good-natured fun. "Meatballs" promise such and ultimately deliver a nourishing watch.
