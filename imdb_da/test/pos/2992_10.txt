I loved this movie! OH, MY GOODNESS! This movie rocked so hard! I found it among some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after reading the back cover to see what the summer had to say about it (which btw mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack to the movie Several times than what the movie actually was about.) I thought it sounded interesting and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. "What is the controversy?" I thought of myself when I put the tape in the player, I was curious, I get. And my expectations were certainly fulfilled. I loved it! I think it's a really nice type of movie, but it was so sweet and sweet! It was a beautiful romance, but at times the director reminded me of the camera's work in 'The Graduate', which I believed at that time, when it was seen that the director must have been angry with some of the close-ups they did. /> <br /> OK, so it wasn't quite possible for these two kids to run out and live alone ... but it could happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the end Sincerely greeted me! I was so sad about how they ended it ... it lets you hang out and I suppose they can address what is actually happening to them in the sequel ... but at the same time I am almost hesitant to see it since the successors are almost never as good as the first. I totally recommend this movie to anyone at all sixteen and over! It's a great movie ... Awesome!
