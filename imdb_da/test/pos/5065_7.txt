The reviews for RENDITION have generally not been favorable so I waited until it moved to the local discount theater to watch it. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an American-Egyptian scientist who was picked up from his international flight and pulled in for interrogation after a strange case fell to a recent terrorist attack in a named North African country. Not as bad as I would fear, it's an interesting and thought-provoking entry into the thriller genre. "<br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film asks tough questions about American methods of curiosity. Information from political prisoners: Is there a crossing of the formerly-uncrossed line to (obviously) using torture on suspected terrorists as ours country needs to do? Provides useful information to help save lives? If so, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are captured and tortured? By sanctioning the use of torture, what kind of monster we become like a country? It is always disappointing when a movie with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good movies look great. For example, I would like to have empathy with Anwar's wife who uses the whole movie to Trace him down, but the only identifiable personality she gets is an advanced state of pregnancy, RENDITION also seems to mean that Arab women who do not go with their fathers' arranged marriage kaber, only asking for trouble, and there is a poorly thought-out scrapbook, held by another of the film's main characters, who too conveniently spells out the details his love interest is in urgent need of that person time. I laughed aloud as the moment should have been filled with fear. The film has a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but too short) appearances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as impressive swings by Omar Atwally such as Anwar El-Ibrahimi and also by actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor which I would all like to see in the future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five or so stories that follow are woven together nicely until the filmmakers insert a weak but effective twist, finally referring to the infinite cycle of carnage that violent terrorist attacks go out.
