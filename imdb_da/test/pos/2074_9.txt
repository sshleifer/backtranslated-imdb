Let's see, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it is simply too long and varied and cerebral to become absolutely perfect across the board, especially as to the challenges of Belgian English and Shakespeare's fierce dialogue. At every division of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes or intonations that you disagree with. I've seen many filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC movie with Jacobi. With respect to full-length productions, this is unique with the very best. <br /> <br /> Most Hamlet productions are drastically reduced to perform the entire game taking a scene time of four to five hours. This production seems to be complete - that is, the entire original Shakespeare dialogue is intact - and then it is important for scholars and Shakespeare lovers. And although the lines seemed premature on rare occasions (for those who are less fully familiar with the text), the script is mostly well-acted, well-spoken and well-executed. Subtitles are available and very helpful, although they are sometimes a little behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a quite admirable job with the theatrical and impossible role of theaters. I actually cried when Hamlet died, and I don't think I've done it before. Patrick Stewart (like Claudius) and Claire Bloom (like Gertrude) are excellent, like Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast. Sets are minimal so we can happily concentrate on the game without disturbance or attention to non-essential things. <br /> <br /> In 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is a long way to go through, but again, if you want the right deal, it is 100% worth it, even if you have to interrupt yourself. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
