One of the exciting aspects of this historic drama is the way in which "Tories" or British American loyalists are laid out and the kind of shine given to their eager support for King George III. In many ways, the American Revolution was certainly a family affair, as some of the richer colonial families were divided by it. If there is a strong criticism for this movie, it may be that people in this story are made to be a little nicer than they really were. In some greetings, the actions in the character of Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least pleasant member of the cast and the error of history. He seems to vary from being a prickly patriot to a kind of "something for the reason," guy. This film concentrates heavily on the concepts of personal honor and personal prestige, which was a great social norm of that day and age. In its subtitle, the fact that about 25 percent of the colonial population was certainly pro-British was also shining. But the strength of the Tory element is not obviously malignant, although the good doctor's character is about 85% overclass twit (to steal a fine sentence from Monty Python's Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a great deal with a rather thin section of the script and it stands out. She was a good choice for the woman with shared loyalty, a "gal" who was rather more modern than the social conventions that day could have allowed - if there had not been a life and an agony that took place. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the movie is the way in which the rivalry of American revolutionary leaders evolved into direct jealousies, and how these personal conflicts almost nearly sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. All in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, the smaller characters are not only human "props", and the battle scenes are credible enough to carry the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It is not quite a good historical drama, but it satisfies it well enough. It rewards a seven, pretty much because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does so well and because Anne Francis makes the best of her support efforts. <br /> <br /> The color printer used on Turner Classic Movies was also very clear and so was an enjoyable presentation in the important respect. Hope it will run again soon.
