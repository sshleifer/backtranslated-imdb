Check Out will be released on Friday, September 15, 2006. through the AMC theater chain starting in New York City. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This movie has been one from the heart, for the heart. From day 1, Mark Lane, Jon Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, and the crew knew that this movie was something particular. The need to comfort the elderly is estimated, the near family is now more evident now. I would recommend this movie to all ages and races. This story calls the truth to someone with or without family.
