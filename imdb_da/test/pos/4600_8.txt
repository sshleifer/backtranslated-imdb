Let me start by saying that if you expect subtle humor, you are in the wrong theater. It is low forehead and heavily hit. But he's not out to tickle your funny leg. He has the sledge hammer out and he is drawn a gem on the side of your head. But don't fear. As film goes, this is a pretty gentle education. Oh, too heavy on the sword, but once again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? F *** no. The gem, the essence of Mike Judge, is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were most popular among teenage boys, the very people where the incessantly stuck fun. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I don't think humor in this movie is aimed at super intelligent. Maybe you're too clever to get it. But he's not aiming for you. He's aiming for your average Joe. And he has a message: Get your action together and for God's sake, study botany! It's a little disjointed and the narrator gets a little annoying after a while, but once again this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's fun. It has a message that it will make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question the Casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ. Sometimes he is not able to play down (what does he have as a 104?) To the level of his character. A little forced at times. <br /> <br /> Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "These guys are like an idiot." In this movie he makes a big idiot. Maybe I'm mental. <br /> <br /> It took a while to warm up to Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little leeway. After all, she had to play the same man for a whole planet. But when she got a small screen time, she made a solid contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he played many times before, but he does a first-rate president anyway. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a griddle and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people speak, as it seems to be the norm in the 'talking-to-TV' age. All in all, a good premise and a competent delivery are given the intended goal. Lots of laughs flowed all the way through. What made this movie scary was that when we left the theater, it was as if the movie was still playing. We saw a lot of idiocy with the people immediately around us, perhaps more clearly at the dose we got in the theater .... <br /> <br /> They are all pods, all of them!
