This was actually a great fit. I missed the first episode, so unfortunately I missed the bond between the characters and the smooth flow of history. But as soon as I saw the other and then the third installment, I was just blown away. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and couldn't wait for it to come, I went straight out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it I was hooked, I just couldn't put it down. I decided to finish the entire book before I dare see the DVD at all. I preferred the book because it came into the character's mind, you could fully understand where they came from and what was the role of history. They missed a lot of adaptation, which was disappointing as the book is a masterpiece, and I think they could have made it great if they had been able to stretch it for a long time. But considering only being able to be mounted in a 3 hour slot, I think it was made excellent. It followed the main twisted story brilliantly. And the actors who were enrolled as the main characters, how amazing! The love making scene was clean, beautiful. It was so tender and loving and just showed how natural gay love can be. I was completely blown away with both the book and the TV adaptation! I loved both Sarah Waters previous novels and also found Tipping the Velvet adaption quite entertaining. But when I read and looked at Fingersmith, I knew that none of her previous novels could adapt. Sarah Waters has actually exceeded herself this time! I recommend you see this custom! If Tipping Velvet wasn't your thing, don't let it get away from it. Fingersmith is a brand new ball game. It's a beautiful yet dark twisted story of love, greed, and fraud ... <br /> <br /> MUST SEE!
