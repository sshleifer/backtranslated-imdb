Although it doesn't seem very promising for a long stretch, Renoir's French Cancan ends up being an effortless charming movie. The story is cliché: a laundromat, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), discovered by a nightclub owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker girlfriend and drops her current boyfriend, who both come back to their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to go back to his humble life with the baker, continue with the show with his employer, oh or become a princess, as a prince falls in love with her also at some point. I'm glad the movie didn't go to the most obvious choice a small movie would probably have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new nightclub, Moulin Rouge, and a couple of beautiful song and dance figures. The first of them, "Complainte de la Butte", which also forms the basis of most of the film's musical score, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of the Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge !, you will recognize the tune as it comes up near the movie, which was sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very prominent in that movie, everyone I know loves to love the soundtrack. In addition to having one of the most beautiful songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the sweetest leading ladies ever to have the gracen. It's hard not to fall over in love with that girl. 8.10.
