This is one of the Tweety and Sylvester cartoons that made this legendary couple just for Bugs Bunny in terms of Looney Tunis's popularity. Besides having all stock situations for this duo (Sylvester feeding waste cans, "I've taken a cap tat" line, etc.), Tweety SOS also stars Granny, which is one of the types of supporting characters that these Warner Bro's classics were in abundance to enrich the color and taste of them. This time out, the cat and the bird are aboard an ocean liner, and the gags extracted from this situation are creative and lively. <br /> <br /> What day was in comic book history when Friz Freleng decided to pair his Sylvester with the late Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.
