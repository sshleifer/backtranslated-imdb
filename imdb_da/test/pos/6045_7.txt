Jack Webb's film "The D.I" came from the real life survey of several practitioners' death in a swamp in Paris Isle in the 50s. As always, Webb, like the patriot he is, has come to defense just like the rest of his shows. I actually found this movie tame after 1957 standards. I earned in the army and can understand the intensity of the training at Parris Island (Camp Death by some), so this movie can never get close to doing 'Full Metal Jacket'. I think it's a good movie that is more patriotic than it actually is. But again, think about the period it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said on film at that time. I've always found Jack Webb to be cut off and very loyal. I know many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. If you feel this way, see 'Full Metal Jacket' by R Lee Ermey. I am a Web fan and enjoy the movie for it's profit, not accuracy. As I have said, Webb believed in this country and held the institutions high moral standards (LAPD Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this from a very strict moral period in this country. Don't be judicial by Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
