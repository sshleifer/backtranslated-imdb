I've heard about this documentary as long as I knew I needed to take the time to see it. As a documentary film, it is very well done, as it takes a neutral observant picture of their experience. There are no voice-overs or interviews. It is honest. It is true. It is also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the movie was finished. One was how the boys were told they should not be like the American boys wearing the pants, and how in Africa there is time, but no money, but in America there is money but no time. The biggest effect was how the boys were hungry for education and how one of the boys moved to himself so he could go to school. I watched this movie with a high school that said it disturbed him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to America. He also said he knew so many American teenagers that simply can't appreciate how much their lives are in America. I agree with him on both accounts. A strong movie that will let a person think of many things.
