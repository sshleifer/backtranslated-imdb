After watching this movie, I realized that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie would not have been available without Drew. The fact that as attractive as Drew could actually break me out and she did when she was "Josie Grossie". Her attempt to "transition" as the cool girls called it was fun, especially her trying to dance at the nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had SNL favorite, Molly Shannon, who played a big role as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the film was that Anita tried to teach the class six oath. This was one of Molly's funniest performances and best. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also had a great deal, and I really felt for her because I know people like her who were tortured like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew is making the movie.
