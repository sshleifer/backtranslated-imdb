A political satire from a comedian (Williams) who, after their political campaigns and presidents, is forced to run. But shockingly we win and make fun of the office. "Man of the Year" is not the funniest movie or the best, but in small doses it works. Williams again with Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam". The two seem to have a good chemistry and work of each other. I don't compare them with Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can get the picture. Although I wouldn't quite say hurry out there and watch the movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but also has a good satire, if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4", it's not for you, take your brain with you to see it. - ***
