I really enjoy this movie. The first time it was at Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did really well, but Brynner steals the show again as always (he's so sexy!). This is one of the films that you see Brynner's feelings. In fact, this movie is the first thing I have ever seen him laugh about because he plays very strong, bigger than life and serious roles in other movies. In this movie you see both a masculine, hard and sensitive side of Brynner. Burner seems to be a "ladies" man in this movie. It's amazing how Brynner eats the glass basin and speaks in his Russian language, it makes me mad in love. I do not understand when both Brynner and Kerr (both have very good chemistry) stars in a movie together and then dying Brynner always in the end it recalls that you "The King and I" somehow.
