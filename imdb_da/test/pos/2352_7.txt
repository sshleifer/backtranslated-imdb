It is 1913. A studio boy spies on the actress, who will be Hollywood's next big movie star, and he is the director to make it happen. After inventing the tower cast and the keystone police, his dream becomes reality. Being totally absorbed in his film production, however, he fails to notice that he loses his leading lady to another man. More over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who knocked down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are unaffected by ambitions and ego. He gets okay as long as he still has his friends. This movie begins as a food-cap comedy that is typical of the time period, and in the opening scene it keeps itself with the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-awareness, which lacks much in most of today's comedies. Shortly into the film, she moves away from this comedy and instead tries to entertain us by using the movies in the movie. These are silent slapstick comedies, well done, but nothing beyond normal, and they go much longer than necessary for any audience who has seen the originals. Upon return, the film takes a dramatic trip. It's well-written, and the cast does an excellent job of the transition, but the film should really have decided from the start what it should be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, it has transformed once again - this time in a break to Hollywood's glitter. The small town of Los Angeles has grown up in the city, making the movies entertaining the whole world. <br /> <br /> In spite of its promising beginnings, this film has not lived very well. Nevertheless, it has some powerful scenes, a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining subtitle about the people who did it and the audience it was made for.
