It is depressing that many people do not understand this movie. Being trapped in the peripheral elements is missing the true meaning of this movie. This movie speaks to the minorities of people who actually believe in love and truth. It points out that in today's society people often say what sounds good at the moment, without the intention of backing up when things get rough. As someone else said, it is evident in the number of divorces. Some people actually believe that marriage is forever. Forget stereotypes or anything, but rather focus on what's important to your heart and fight for who you believe in. I liked the end because it would have been easy to go with a sappy but instead come up with the reality that is done great and you have to fight with everything you have, but sometimes it's still not enough. Too often people just give up and forget about the magic of love. late.
