Here's what to keep in mind about this movie .... IT'S A KIDS PHILO !!!!! I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm an 80 year old child. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So of course I love this movie. But if you see the other Rainbow Brite movies this is by far the best. But as I said, it's a kids movie. You have to judge it as a children's movie. It does not matter to children if the play, animation or script is fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or girl) wins then it's a good movie. If not, then it is bad. You all know what I mean. You were all kids once.
