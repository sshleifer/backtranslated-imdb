Just before World War II, this is a touching and discreet romantic story that is loosely based on a real event. It is a German rocket researcher Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen) who works in the UK in the advent of World War II. Fear of Hitler may revoke him to Germany to help him prepare for war, Zucher and his smooth assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuated by the British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They have been tasked with building a rocket post box that allows the islanders to communicate with the mainland. <br /> <br /> Mocked and bullied by the islanders, they settled with local girl Catherine Mackay (the amazing Shauna MacDonald), with whom Thomsen begins an affair, but complications arise when Germany comes to call ... The Central romance between Zucher and Catherine is subtle and sincerely played, and the supportive caste is a colorful bunch of an array of respected Scottish characters, including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> Fine filmography and a brilliant central theme sang in the local dialect around this movie. <br /> <br /> Intelligent but indispensable, it's good for a quiet night in.
