THE ENGLISH PATIENT not only has it all (doomed romance, tragic war, great characters), but it has some way that no other movie does. It's a spellbindingly tale told through flashbacks featuring amazing results of all in-depth images, characters we're interested in and the most rapturous love story ever told. A biographical landmark, the best movie from 1996 and one of the very best of the 1990s.
