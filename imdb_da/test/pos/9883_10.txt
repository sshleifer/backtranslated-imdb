This film exhibits dear irony, racial dog roundabout lines woven with subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich saturated color and fabulous reproduction of chase scenes on Keystone Cops. <br /> <br /> The ensemble work from the cast and the entire crew is charming. Literally. How else could I continue? <br /> <br /> This movie speaks to everyone. The deep and sharp use of so many universal archetypes: This is what makes this film so deeply satisfactory. <br /> <br /> As a mature film student, I find Checking Out contains all vital elements. Safe and Bergorra, it is not the Godfather, but would serve perfectly as a follow-up; The tragedy's mandatory Satyr game, which sweetly binds our collective Catholic wounds. <br /> <br /> Get yourself into a theater and watch this movie you are treated to a unique masterpiece.
