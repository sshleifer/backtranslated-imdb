Didn't really know what to expect from this movie - and found myself pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently stumbled upon Norman Reedus and trying to find more of the movies he has been in. I'm not big in hustler movies or movies, but I have to say this shouted me within minutes . Probably because I couldn't stop finding out who was hustling who. This movie is stylish and fast, with a story that is credible thanks to location and amazing performances. <br /> <br /> While I was most impressed with the movie, I have to say that Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. br /> <br /> Give it a try - it's a really fun movie.
