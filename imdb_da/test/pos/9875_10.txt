Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers", which great movie. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a smart plot that I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think it gives the Halloween series some plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and has an excellent performance, especially for her first film, and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also good. My only complaint is, why wasn't Danielle Harris in this movie like Jamie? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. I still love Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks best in this movie, and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly scary and exciting, Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I love this very violent but immensely fun movie. Halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
