This movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies I've ever seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Momma well portrayed and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it starts differently than you would expect. Larry tries to write a book and has some problems. Larry learns a writing class and the Owen mark after Larry tries to get him to read his story. Owen eventually asked Larry to kill his mother, and on the other hand, Owen would kill Larry's former wife. The whole movie was really fun. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is the end when Owen writes "Throw Momma from the Train". Larry gets furious because he just wrote a book with similar plot. It turns out that Owen wrote a children's pop-up book. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
