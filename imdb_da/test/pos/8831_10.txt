Duck_of_Death needs to watch this movie again as his major criticism is completely unfounded. The movie never forgot the delay, and it was mentioned explicitly in a few places. The crew was never shown to have talks with mission control that did not comply with the time delay rules. One thing I thought was a little removed was the risk involved - would a crew land on a planet where pressure suits only last two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned spaceship go into a star's corona? I doubt it. Would people land on a moon that was bombarded with large amounts of radiation? I doubt it. The ship also seemed excessively robust. Would a ship design the risk of atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt it. Would it survive being hit by comet dirt? I doubt it. I think in both cases that the stress on the structure would be too much. But all in all, the unlikely scenarios were offset by some nicely performed special effects, good editing and production, and some good plays, especially by the actors depicting the ship's commander and Russian cosmonaut.
