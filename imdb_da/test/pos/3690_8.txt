But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure any description of the movie and the plot will entice you to watch it. Suffice it to say that it has something for just about everyone: death, song, a spark suit, cell phones, a small person (nicely looking woman, actually), a bridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and an armbue . Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You have to trust me when I say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the Absurd Gen in your DNA makeup. It's not your fault; it is hereditarily. The other 50% of you would probably like to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you have to watch out. <br /> <br /> Knowing that, you can finally think about why you looked ... but keep in mind that absurdity. It must grow on you. It's a test.
