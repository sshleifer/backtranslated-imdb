(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> Five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger George Kennedy and walk up to the dim Oregon mountains where they are stalked and slaughtered by a couple of large, deformed, farmed hillbilly twins. When only two are left, Warren and his girl take Connie back to their animal instincts to stay alive. The movie ends with Connie pushing half the arm down to one of the guys' throats and choking him to death. A very powerful, if somewhat overrated, backwoods slasher flick thats the effective use of lighting, sound and photography makes it a chop over the usual Friday the 13th cash-in. Lead by an attractive, sympathetic cast, especially Deborah Benson (where is she now?) And Gregg Henry, this nifty companion piece to director Jeff Liebermans SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not be missed.
