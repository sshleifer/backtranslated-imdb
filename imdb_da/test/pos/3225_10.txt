I fell in love with this girl. Let me tell you something: I'm from Romania, and here's just the sixth series that runs the bundle every other day that's on the US TV. I check the internet and download it from there, so I'm consistent with the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am in this show. I totally know everything about those I looked at on the Internet, what is Rory's car, what are their middle names and things like this: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can't understand why, but my boyfriend doesn't like them and I'm trying to make him see how wonderful they are but without success, but he understands me and lets me stay with my "obsession" with Gilmore Girls. I love them. I really hope that if anyone sees, this will give them a chance: You won't regret it
