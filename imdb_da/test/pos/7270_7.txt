When I sat down in the cinema to watch this, I waited to see some kind of stylish action movie that had been implicated in trailers. However, it soon became clear that this film was trying to be more. Normally, I don't approve of movies trying to entertain in as many ways as possible. For example, this film tries to mix actions with comedy, romance, ease and seriousness at once. Most of the time this kind of approach does not go into movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they took it off. The end result is a very entertaining movie that should appeal to most mature cinema makers. (However, the weak in the stomach should really be warned about one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller draw a brilliant double action, and Ken Stott makes an excellent villain. This blended in with amazing costumes and a few decent action scenes make it a very comfortable watch. <br /> <br /> But the big disappointment for me is that it was right to have 'The Gentleman Highwayman' the opportunity for a good dialogue, but the manuscript lacked the absolute lack of punchiness and there were few stomach grins. Okay, so the lines weren't terrible, but for me it highlights a problem with recent British movies; ignoring a few notable exceptions, the screens written today are still relatively mediocre compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
