Killing Yard is a great movie, even though it is uneven at times. Morris Chestnut presents a phenomenal effort as a psychologically wounded and legally imprisoned prison prison, and Alan Alda's presence as his defense lawyer is none other than genius. The feeling and the raw reality depicted in this movie's "flashback" scenes have the ability to put viewers directly into the middle of events as depicted. I was not even born when the Attica riots took place, but through extensive research I find that "The Killing Yard" makes history all fair. I would definitely recommend this movie for displaying an educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool.
