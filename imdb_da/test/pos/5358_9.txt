Wallace and Gromit are the protagonists of some of the best cartoons ever made. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers" and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning multiple Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite popular in the US, but his influence on the US has not been great. After the third Wallace and Gromit card, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, but for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, we get another brilliant claymation movie from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which was almost nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was this film's success that eventually drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project. 5 years later (these kind of movies take a long time you know) and much expectation, Wallace and Gromit finally hit the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and the marketing campaign, this film delivers in many ways. This movie will be a pleasure for both children and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden under the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly just suits both children and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble lately. Despite the fact that the DreamWorks logo hit the poster, this movie is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Wallace and Gromit are running a business that protects the urban crops from being destroyed by rabbits, which apparently had been running wild and in large numbers recently. Their business has got them a lot of respect from the others who live in the city because a gigantic vegetable competition quickly approached and the crops needed protection. Complications occur when Wallace tries to manipulate the rabbits into non-tasting vegetables, and then a good dining machine is released in the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the giant animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their urban approval. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also caught the attention of a snobber named Victor. Simple plot Yes, but there is more than the eye, be prepared for some fun surprises along the way, as in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that must set the pacing and mood of the movie. Despite the fact that 5 years is required to produce only 85 minutes of recording, the payout is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one view to really notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost flawless animation is the indescribable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it's a creatively placed shot or normal marks put in the funniest position possible, or it's the hairy rabbits that are constantly shown in the movie, most curses of Were-Rabbit's humor come strictly from just watching the movie. yourself and catch all the references before it's too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except the more fun much less pop culture references and better animation. <br /> <br /> Casting was great, although in a movie with little dialogue it wasn't that important. Once again, Peter Sallis does a wonderful job as Wallace, although in this movie there was no stand-alone quote that can be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "That's the wrong Gromit pants and they're gone wrong!") . Ralph Fiennes does a fantastic job as the leading villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy woman leader in the "Fight Club" cult) giving her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love. Though nothing could cope with the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers", the curse of Ware-Rabbit had lots of action scenes, including a fantastic chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal sometimes. Whether it's their sweet expression, their fun movements or their howling, the rabbits in the movie themselves take a glimpse of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, at the end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter. Bottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this movie is as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost all the movies that come out this year, the film does not pull at all when you look in at short 85 minutes, but still contains so much joy and fun, it will let everyone see it and ask for more. There is very little wrong with the movie; It was a pure joy to see. This film is a total contrast of the decent but vulgar, rude, raw films that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old virgin, wedding gamer and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; It is a good thing. Recommended, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we've seen this decade. Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wares Rabbit: Totally harmless fun from the second to the second 5.100.
