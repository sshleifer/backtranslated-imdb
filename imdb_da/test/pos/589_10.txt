I've seen the start of Muppet Movie, but only half. Because I only looked at Mrs. Kelly's friend's house. The songs were the best and the Muppets were so Hilarious. They learn it if they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can do it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was included in the trailer). Kermit is my favorite protagonist (Which means it describes the protagonist) And then the other muppets. Mel Brooks was great when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by making Kung Fu on the Guys. It was so cold. Muppet Movie is the best Jim Henson movie with the most gracious characters and people will cherish his successful movie.
