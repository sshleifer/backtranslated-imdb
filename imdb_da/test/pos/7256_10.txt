Plunkett & Macleane fall into my favorite genre of movies (historical action adventure with comedy), which is probably why I rate it so highly. The action is centered around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a layabout 'gentleman' who is rooted in him and his arrangements (Macleane). This leads to all kinds of escapades and adventures, all of which are colored with comedy. There is of course also a love interest. The rest of the casting consists of a number of living, larger than life characters, which add to the atmosphere of the film and show the surplus of the kingdom at this time. <br /> <br /> This is an enjoyable movie with a rather simple but dignified plot that provides lots of entertainment.
