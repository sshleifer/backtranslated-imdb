I first saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90s when I was at the art college and moved among artists and musicians in the hope of future success. So 'The Second Home' - of friendships made after leaving the family home to strive for a professional excellence - strongly resonated with my living reality. I was fascinated by the characters, the narrative, the lyrical camera work and above all the music. In it I could divine the beginning of German electronic music from the 50's Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, 70's Faust, sound competition by John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia of The White Noise. Soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff from Carmina Burana fame, so I found her taste modern to the Electronic Pop / Sound Effects world. <br /> <br /> I didn't see Heimat or Heimat 3, so I saw it as a whole in itself without before or after. As someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including the wonderful voice of Gisela Mullers (Evelyn), Bach marimba by Daniel Smith (Juan), piano game by Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the cello game by Salome Chamber (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but it has already been said here. Why can't British or American television produce such masterpieces? Wiret had realism and politics and the epic sweep of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had imaginative troops for their serialized television work, but it is art house and soap in its most cinematic and narrative sublime. It is never included in the critics' choice of best movies, but it should be. Still as poetic and powerful as when I first saw it 17 years ago. I see the 3 boxed sets each fall for their 'mellow fruitfulness'. Inspired and inspiring.
