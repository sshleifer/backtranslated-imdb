Anyone looking for an episode of "law and order" or "CSI" must look elsewhere, as the most basic elements of the police or forensic work were completely ignored in this case. A murder took place and all the police did was grab a 15-year-old boy out of the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and is that the guy who did it? Sure the old man thought the child in the back of the police was guilty. Remember, he didn't see anything as the right killer and was dressed completely differently. He must have shrunk, turned his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes. <br /> <br /> The police did absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! No forensic medicine did any of the evidence they did not make any other witnesses, and they became acquainted with a 15-year-old. The scary thing about this compelling look at the criminal system is that it happened just down the road in Jacksonville, Florida. Now let everyone begin to talk about "Southern Justice".
