Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hardworking, female Texas congressman with no estimated regulatory record. In 1980, he finds himself interested in the situation in Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the Soviet Union. On behalf of his old flame, arch-conservative Texas socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees. He returns to the US, determined to help the Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and even under investigation for drug use claims. Wilson recruits herring and the vulgar, excluded CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to launch a fierce arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a most ignorant US Congress. Ultimately, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but while America celebrates their victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan falling on deaf ears. Charlie Wilson's war is slim brain candy, a great movie for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average movie-maker. The film gathers an amazing array of talents both in front of and behind the camera and delivers on its promise of being a hell of a good time. The movie has only one error that we come to later. As a study of the unlikely way in which the greatest hidden war of the 20th century was conducted - and perhaps the way things are done by the CIA and other intelligence services - it is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting at a number of levels. The story depicted in the film - with all its outrageous double-handed, shabby hidden operations and perhaps most successful - would be as scandalous as a fictionality that could easily be dismissed as satire. But things really worked this way, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three main characters in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without hiding their mistakes. Wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices (even embracing them) - yet willing to embrace a just cause. Herring is something of an elitist, and her origin of justice is deterrent - yet she is deeply involved in the case of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with an attitude problem, looked down because of his "street" background - yet his love for the land of communism and hates is infallible. The fact that this strange trio could play an important role in the fall of the Soviet Union is not only a proof that someone can make a difference, but also that the truth is alien to fiction. It is also very interesting that all this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, as our author is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> However, the film does have a drawback, which is a little surprising. The movie seems to be celebrating Wilson and Co's performance. That's fine - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is there? - Until one believes that out of the ashes of Soviet defeat in Afghanistan came the Taliban and ultimately al-Qaeda. Regardless of the US level of responsibility, it happened and the film's portrayal of Wilson's success is almost untouched. To be fair, the film deals with this problem at the end, with a fairly up-to-date speech from Wilson about the US's inability to clean up after itself, but it is done in such a tertiary way that the average seer will probably not take much of it it. The overall impression would be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans defeat the Soviets. This is not a deadly disadvantage, imagine, but it is a worrying aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> The film's talent is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols delivers a beautiful and beautiful look; The material fits perfectly with his underrated, scary directorial style. Sorkin delivers another brilliant manuscript; the film has dozens of citable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best is the "Scotch Bottle" discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos) and holds some of a political and historical perspective behind it. The movie's cast is a marvel: Tom Hanks gives a good performance as the gracious rogue with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the unpleasant, but committed Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (couples usually) as abrasive Gus. The always lovely Amy Adams takes another step on his way to stardom as Wilson's long suffering assistant, and Ned Beatty, About Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott throw out the supportive throw. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war is an intelligent and fun movie, a wonderful part of a bit more than light entertainment. The fact that it decides not to be more than that should not be opposed to it; It is brilliant at what it does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
