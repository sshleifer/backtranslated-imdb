God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (film-wise;)), sci-fi etc. This one was a little harder to see, but another fun BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people preface a negative review with "I usually enjoy bad movies, but ..." No, but it was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man Conan, but oh what fun. Who can't have fun with a primitive atomic bomb, a hang glider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's great to hate this movie if you just like Hollywood dragons like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really think you really love bad movies, check this out. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that is fun to rent for a beehive or when you have a few friends around looking for a little thoughtless fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
