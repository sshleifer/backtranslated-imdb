It's the movie that lots of people hail like a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, Redux resumes 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The movie is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's the most important plot (if any) to be Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on the way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the colonel's story along the way. <br /> <br /> My first feelings about the movie is that it is not particularly poignant at times, especially early, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses, a great thrill is built up with Willard's reading through various reports by fellow Kurtz, until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the movie reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects that everyone is looking for in a decent movie are all of a good standard. Special cinematography stands out as unique, and I have found the performance of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest at every value a special mention. The result I originally found, but it was not entirely certain if the film progressed. It is not certain whether it actually improved, or it fits better, or if it had just grown on me, but at the end of the movie I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I've seen the Redux version (I've seen the original about four times) I would say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" movie with lots of war. The fact that Willard had the mission in the beginning of the movie and did not bring it to the end, had bored me because all the character interactions in the way of the movie seemed unnecessary. This is because the plot is not completely defined (since the focus is more on the sign and the journey more than the plot), in most cases it is necessary to have a different view to fully appreciate the movie (as with any movie that is more character than plot based), as the second time, you know where the plot goes. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the big four Vietnam movies, Apocalypse now wins the rest in the atmosphere but lacks the action and commitment of Plato, the emotional intensity of Deer Hunter, and can't really be compared to the Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially at the end, where it gets staggering and recommended to anyone who enjoys a good character-based movie and does not mind a random violence.
