When you see this weird little fairy tale movie, it's hard to believe that it was ruled by the same man who led us to such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice by Mrs Wardh and Scorpion's Tail Case, but it must be said that despite all It's low quality production values, Island of the Fish But is an entertaining trip and one that probably deserves more praise than it gets. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is a rip off of a successful American movie, one being the critical island of Dr Moreau. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas like mutation, greed, and adventure, shaping it into a somewhat convincing movie, allowing for what is lacking in context and logic with a lot of fascinating ideas. The central plot follows a boat that goes down on a small island. It soon turns out that not all of this place is normal and it soon turns out that half of the population has been converted into "fishermen" - a cross between a man and a fish consisting solely of selfish reasons. The truth about this movie is that it is very fun if you ignore the fragile production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the film is set on sets that seem to cost a few pennies - but the film is well shot despite this, with the underwater photography being a special highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done since the film never gets boring. The way the plot comes together is not exactly genius, but it requires many ideas, and I've seen movies made on plotter with much less thought put in them than this one. The biggest location standout in the movie is definitely the lost at Atlantis. To be honest I am not a massive fan of fairytale movies, and therefore you cannot see this lost city mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. The central island location is good because it provides an appropriate setting for the story and also gives the movie the right amount of mystery as Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. All in all, this is not exactly a classic, and there is certainly much worse trashy adventure film out there.
