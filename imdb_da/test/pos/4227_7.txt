This film exemplifies a particular brand of comedy terror of a strictly adult kind, but quite different from the Troma films (with which it shares certain qualities). The humor is rough and clear, but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​hideous dolls with evil forces and winding minds does not pull you with boredom, reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie yet.
