... the world can never know. (The movie that took the "best animated short" Oscar that year, "Anna and Bella" is very good, but it's not "Big Snit". Both are available on Extended Entertainment "World's Largest Animation" Collection, if you I would like to compare.) <br /> <br /> "Cut" and its director, Richard Condie, have attracted so much attention that there is little for me to add. However, I would note that the film contains one of my very favorite single "shots" in an animated card, the one in which the man opens the door to let the cat out. I will not give away the actual events depicted here, but the first time I saw the shot I was whipped from one mood to another, then seconds later for another. That shot has never failed to affect me that way since. For this shot, and for the way Condie builds up at that moment, "The Big Cut" deserves the "masterpiece" mark.
