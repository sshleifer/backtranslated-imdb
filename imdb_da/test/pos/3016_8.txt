I don't want to go into a criticism of the movie, which I think is - for a big budget film - quite unusual and bold. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to note that I'm very tired of studios policies and laws in different states that treat their viewers as children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the film according to the term. But, of course, it is likely that there are far more different cuts. The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina, where the movie runs 115 minutes, which sounds pretty complete). <br /> <br /> Later on DVD and Video, studies are trying to rob us further by selling us a presumably director's cut (in Germany, such a version is already around and running about 110 minutes). It would be nice if the studios would not only think of the money they make with their film, but also think of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavorable assessment, so as a seer I don't have to feel cheated and is taken seriously, not just as a resource for money.
