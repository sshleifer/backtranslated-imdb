I had to call my mother (a WASP) to ask her about this. Was it really that bad in the 40s in New York? Surprise, she couldn't remember. So I told her to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, in not a play, but a NOVEL for a change, was 30 when he wrote this in 1945. It is a painful portrayal of anti-Semitism. Strangely enough, there is a tender history of human relations (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, non-Jew, primarily) underlying the cruel story. The action is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of because this doesn't make it big in the theater is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. <Br /> I actually give it ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's so worth seeing.
