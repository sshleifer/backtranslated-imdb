Ok, the show was a bit uneven, but I still loved it. I found the two biggest rabbits annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really want the Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please drop them! <br /> <br /> Especially "Potty years" episode released on 11/22/91; The episode "Going up" released on 9/17/92 and the "Minister Golf" section of 11/92. <br /> <br /> They're the funniest bits in the whole series and even over a decade later we're still referring to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
