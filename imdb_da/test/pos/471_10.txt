It was a fantastic movie about two people, a young teenage girl and the other, a medieval man, each seeking someone to help them fulfill some emptiness left by their former loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors provide brilliant performances that different audiences can relate to. The scripture, though written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this movie that you are not alone.
