In the book of life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who discovers at JFK airport on December 31, to usher in the new millennium by fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt's accountant from amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. As usual, Hartley creates a surrealistic world where ordinary beauty made strange and other world classes through artistic-framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shade. As usual, he apparently introduces random details early, then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts - humor is simple but creepy and irrepressible. Hartley has a great ability to build on small and rapturous moments of contemporary and scandalous. As usual, he creates a tone that is sad and world-demanding, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. He moves within minutes of troubled humor into a language that is metaphysical and poetic - the kind of writing that is so dead and perfect, that it is difficult to keep tears despite the lack of obvious feelings. Another great and very entertaining movie. The Book of Life is shot (a digital camera?) With a blurred effect: A sense of the heavenly hand in hand with impending death and a hyper-consciousness of the present as fragile and fleeting at the last moment. All of Hartley's movies have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect unites it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is initially, but more and more beautiful when you familiarize yourself with it. The final shot is spectacular. All this can sound valuable, but the movie is a comedy, and it makes fun of itself, even though it makes fun with the concept of Armageddon, Doomsday and "Urbanity". Although it is actually quite deep, moving and conscious, it is mostly light-hearted and playful. The action is flawless with regard to the kind of subdued tone Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people do not get and who ask them to judge such a cave - the same people who have a negative answer to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are bound to be people who respond to this movie with cynicism and passion - people get rid of Hartley's sudden shift and what they look to be pretentious or mannerist techniques - but anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this movie (if they can get a chance to see what it is). It's hard to say how it would be on video.
