Call the manipulative drive if you want, but I fell for it. Sure there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been better movies and less of a constant "movie of the week", but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding sweet and touching, and let's see the people in fact, how many of us really come to know motivation from others. Not many. We got a little insight into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialogue in my opinion, not too quickly to forget), so in my opinion it was a lovely tribute to a person who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another person, and meanwhile, life affected hundreds more. A lesson we all need for me reminded. Why is it that the right thing to do is so often the most difficult thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You will not be disappointed. And take your Kleenex. 8.10
