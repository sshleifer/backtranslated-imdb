The film is really about choice. In the suppressed state of Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was right in the eyes of traditions, there seemed to be little opportunity for Radha and Sita. But granted that it was not their only option. What is life without desire, asks Radha Ashok. Yes, it is true that life gives us a number of options, but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian household, you are a dutiful sister-in-law to a quiet but attentive, yet powerful matriarch, a 13-year-old dedicated wife to a man who has made a promise of celibacy because you're not able to have a child, a man who only wants you to lie next to him to prove his strength in removing his desires. I felt that the ladies had little choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I think the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehta's work was because it allowed them to think for themselves. An opportunity to do what might be unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt were just putting this point across. Every scene in the movie from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last one at the mosque is etched in my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. To feel that you had to refrain from the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you. To suppress any desire you may have and to demand for human touch. What then is the meaning of our existence, one wonders. In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room, and Radha comes in to comfort her, their lips accidentally brush against each other, and it arouses a feeling in them. Something they have both been deprived of. <br /> <br /> Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly. I especially like flashbacks for the young Radha trying to 'see' the ocean. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom to choose, freedom to transport us to places we normally could not reach. In these scenes, it is cautiously told us that her sense of duty has also gone down from her mother, as I suppose, lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score of A.R. Rahman. Since the film I have become diligent fans of the two leading actresses and director. I look forward to several of Ms Deepa's future productions.
