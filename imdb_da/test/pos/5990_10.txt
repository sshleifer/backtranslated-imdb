This movie came out at the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: the rich man meets and learns to love a poor working-class woman, the characters Romuald and Juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to Pretty Woman in so many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman, and the wise ways she helps her boss overcome her problems will make you cheer. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. Romuald's efforts to win Juliet's love exceed the magnificent climbing of Pretty Woman's hundred times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
