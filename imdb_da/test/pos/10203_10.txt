Here's another of the 1940s westerns that I see when it comes to TCM or FMC, because although it may be historically wrong, it's extremely entertaining and well-acted, plus Randolph Scott, my favorite actor to Gary Cooper-Well, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself is historically accurate and, as I said before, worked well and "floats" very well. I know I've seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy each view more than the one before. I have it on tape from TCM but would buy it in a moment if it ever came out on DVD. See it if you don't - I guarantee you like it!
