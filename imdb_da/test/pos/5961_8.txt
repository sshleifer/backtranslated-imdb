Excellent multi-level exercise: <br /> <br /> - Shows the unfinished colonial spirit in France <br /> <br /> - More generally the boring thinking superiority of all Western people <br /> <br /> - a renewal of spy and thriller film: OSS 117 is imperfect and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that, despite all these messages, it's a fun movie, lots of jokes and gags, very bright and sparkling. <br /> <br /> Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. Wondering how it will be appreciated in the United States? <br /> <br /> Seems to be a success in France, so probably comes a next version.
