I think the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music was amazing. Although the director has managed to show the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer from the dominant culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a little and has focused more on the violence she is facing.
