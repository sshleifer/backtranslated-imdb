Golden Boy is in my opinion a sleeping / lost treasure animating out there. A sexy comedy about a young man seeking to find his life in life, and he slams into all sorts of odd jobs that somehow have this rather sexy girl who eventually falls for him, but he understands not really! It's really something you can easily miss if you know it, but when you see it ... it will fall to the comedy / silliness inside. Really a crime that produced only 6 OVA episodes and pilot films were made. But being unique as it is. I'm surprised it survived to produce so many. If you want a good laugh, with high quality anime that is (100% CGI free), check out this anime. Boy who can one day save the world .... or maybe not.
