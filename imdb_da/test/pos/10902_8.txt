After reading the comment made about this movie and currently watching it, I can understand how the person felt about it. The decisions made were after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I had heard the information about how it happened. The story was made of a concrete event. During an exhibition, an actor, thanks to the people, attributed the prize to a former schoolteacher who unexpectedly fled the person. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come "out" of the closet most every day. Each trip is different for each person. In fact, the result of any individual will also be different. And a willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more filled. For the movie is the result of how Howard is out, much more comical than real life. And the acceptance of society showed the others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. The memorable quotes and use of music adds the stereotypes out there in the world, but taken with tongue and cheek humor. It's a movie. Sit down, watch for an open mind and grin your head.
