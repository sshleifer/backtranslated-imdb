This film has its critics, and Courtney's feuding dresser can offend some people (who honestly need a good smack upside down) - but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, exciting, relevant. Of course, Finney is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performance was terribly strong in both leaders, and Courtney's character gives lots of dark humor. The period is well-developed, the supporting spirit selected well-chosen. This is to be seen and savored as a nice cordial. I just wished it was out on DVD already ... (* sigh *) ...
