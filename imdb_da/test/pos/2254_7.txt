The movie "Everything Illuminated" comes from first-time author director Liev Schreiber, who adapts Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel. The book was ambitious and bubbly, its magically-realistic elements and living language, seemingly impossible to represent on the screen. The movie, wise, tries less. While the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it is still an accomplished film about a strange Eastern European car ride, or as one of the letters would have, "a very stiff search". <br /> <br /> This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture, but can't seem to get the English language straight. Nonetheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a travel agency that provides American Jews, persuades him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan examines his family history and specifically tries to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret is revealed during their search. The movie Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi-kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his "family thing" collection. Woods quiet, wide-eyed, serious way works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the runaway, light-hearted Alex. His malapropism is hilarious, but he is also able to draw the growing self-consciousness of the character. The dog Mikki is very fun as the denied Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. and one of the few movie dogs I have ever seen is not cloyingly sweet and precocious. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Everything is Illuminated" puts the Holocaust on human scale and asks us not to remember it as a general event but as millions of specific small tragedies. Reminder of a European film, it also points to the effect of past events on contemporary youth like Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking images, "Everything Illuminated" is a good first-hour work, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to lead films.
