I remember the events of this movie, the sick-day cruise in Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe, which was once released around the world's yacht race. I was a 13 year old living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, he was the knight of his exploits) had completed the first solar eclipse of the globe. I remember most of the time because we had time for school to see his return (on a black and white TV!) And saw his knight of the queen. It provoked a major outbreak of patriotic fervor in Britain. It all seems so picturesque now. Chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped halfway in Australia to adapt his yacht, so the next logical step for sailors was to try the journey without stopping. It is important to remember that this was a world pre-GPS, since land-based communications were still rather irregular, never mind in the middle of the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit on a keychain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of sailors were enrolled (all men there), including mystery man, Crowhurst. Basically a weekend sailor, Crowhurst had not been a great success in any previous business, including careers in the British Army, Air Force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. He wanted to do something great with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $ 100,000 in today's money) and the subsequent publicity as a means of kick-starting his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor who turned out to be more waterproof than his boat and that meant failure would bankrupt him, and he soon found a popular figure with journalists as he was preparing for the race. Now the British always love the idea of ​​the gutsy amateur taking on the 'pros'. (Think Eddie Eagle losing endless Olympic jump competitions and amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National Horse Race.) The public queued up to see him go, but his boat wasn't really ready and even when he started (the last competitor to to leave Britain) Crowhurst must have known he has not had a chance. But too much was driving him to stop. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive film, we see doubts written over his poor wife's face. Left with their 4 children, she is interviewed moving throughout the film with one of Crowhurst's sons. She was in a no-win situation. Had she tried to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but subsequently she was torn with doubt whether she could have saved her life by stopping him. Faced with the particular truth that his boat was delicious and would never make it through the southern oceans, and could not turn around and persuade ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. Set offshore Argentina and Brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round Cape Horn and start up the Atlantic and thought he could sneak into the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around about the globe. He faked with his logs and made 16mm movies and sound recordings to back up his plan. But when the other competitors fell apart, he realized that he was actually entering the 2nd and his logs would be investigated. Cannot adhere to certain evidence, his record suggests that he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. His yacht was found. He was never. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited movie also follows the journey to Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor who was second and determined on the fastest travel prize when he suddenly left the race, unable to trade in screaming and publishing he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder and eventually pulled up 10 months later in Tahiti. After spending some seven years working at sea myself (although on very different ships to these) I understand the features of the sea. Standing on deck and watching water in all directions to the horizon, knowing that there are a few miles of water beneath you, nothing between you and oblivion, but a thin metal hull without easy access to television or radio (even today at most work ships you feel pretty isolated), it is possible to really escape the responsibility of everyday life for a while. There is a thought-provoking analysis of what drives people to try this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on human mind. Most people think that the attempt to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but there is much of the need for self-discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. <br /> <br /> I strongly assume that Robin Knox Johnston, the former marine guy who won the race (and many ago) knew well who he was before he left, so he just couldn't win the race but also maintain its beauty on its way. Those who searched for something profound in themselves may not have fully wished what they found. <br /> <br /> The brilliant archive film from the UK at the end of the 60s is almost enough to look at this (did it really look so bad? I can't remember it looking so stupid, but Maybe we just need to get out the worst aspects of the past?) But overall, it's an excellently made and exciting movie. Highly recommended.
