I know that this movie has had a rough tour from the critics, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The real star here is the amazing Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both fun and compelling in all his varied aprons. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that illuminates his outrageous talk. Special mention should also go to Michael Gambon, who plays for laughs with an excellently accurate yet comical inner city Dublin accent. The only weak connection is Caine, who of course has a big laugh that hangs up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. It probably won't play so well abroad, but it is worth looking at the same.
