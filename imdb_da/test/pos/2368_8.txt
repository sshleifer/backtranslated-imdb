This movie makes several nods to various science fiction movies. The prologo reminds me of the original theater version of THX-1138 (trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clip from some early Japanese SF TV shows). Then, the city's opening shot in the 2345 draw began to fly overhead with a billboard reminiscent of the BLADERUNNER immediately. The BLADERUNNER aspect is even more pronounced when we meet the hero called a replica (he is blonde-haired and named Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in the BLADERUNNER?). A battle scene soon follows, reminiscent of an instant by THE MATRIX. The government forces the population to take drugs is like THX-1138 and the supreme enforcer, while it looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, much like the TERMINATOR. The final match resembles one of the TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is fun. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but it's fun, certainly much more enjoyable than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
