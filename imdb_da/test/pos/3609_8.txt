Warning: If Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in movies, disregard this review and continue. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed a "line map" from the book of President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this film emphasizes the role character plays in the lives of honorable people. This movie is full of honest, decent people and they have integrity to spare. In a word they have "character". A little nitpick: Unless you know the history of WW II, you probably don't know, from Captain Correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years have passed. The average viewer may think that the romance was of the "whirlwind" variety. It's not like that. Romance slowly develops, giving both dignity and meaning. The film's conscious pace can be the director's way of marking time. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The story was right on the mark. Yes, the Germans turned to their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies from the start. If you find it shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was inflated by the British in 1940, just after France's capitulation, not to fall into the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <br /> The exhibition of the Italians as educated and cultivated was a compliment to a trained and cultural civilization. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical. Scripture was not thought-provoking, nor was it wise, but here was a situation where confusion and intelligence were not needed, nor would they have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is tender and the message is uplifting. The characters are honest, courageous, serious, sympathetic and sympathetic. It's a nice little movie. 8.10. <br /> <br /> <br />
