Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy rescues Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in the Eiffel trip and has a crush on her. He doesn't know she's a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy gets hurt and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to get back to normal is to kill werewolf who attacked him and eats his heart. This film is a fierce black humor film. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent and highlight the band's ties. I do not know why some readers compare this movie with the masterpiece 'An American Werewolf in London'. The stories have nothing in common (only an American teen, werewolf and a city in Europe). Highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor film. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American Werewolf in Paris")
