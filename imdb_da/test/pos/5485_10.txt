I'm a big fan of big, noisy, trashy, totally silly action movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. All these are fun to watch, but when you think about it, it's very stupid. In LINE OF FIRE, a story tells, and that tells it well. With plausibility as well as excitement and excitement, it has also taken on several important moral issues that really make you think. The last shot in the film is Eastwood and Russo, sitting together on the steps of the white house and watching the pigeons on gentle and peaceful music, and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. It was because I cared about the characters, and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. It felt like a true story. As the aging secret service agent plagued by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on the fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is amazing. He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum, John Malkovich is like the creepy predator torturing Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by blatantly telling him about his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich speaks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable kindness right up to the last moment. In addition to this exciting main drawing, there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. In spite of the age difference, the excellent chemistry on the screen and the director have not been wise that this dominates too much, but holds it as part of the background that works nicely. In summary, I love this movie because it has a mind.
