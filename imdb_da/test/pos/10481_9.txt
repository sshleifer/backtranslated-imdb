This film came aside as a shock in the eighties. From trends, that is, at the heart of sincere creativity, Babette's guest prayer stands as one of the finest movies of his time. Stephen Audran, the wonderful actress of his former husband Claude Chabril's greatest achievements (le boucher, la rupture, les noces rouges, all unqualified musts for movie buffs) gave a lifetime achievement. To see her prepare with love and affection, her meal is a feast for the eyes. All the people who saw this masterpiece actually tasted at Babette's culinary triumph. But the most moving part of the story is its conclusion: Babette was a great French chef, she was famous, now she found a new homeland, but her feast is behind her, and she will never be allowed to return to her dear france. So the two old sisters comfort her: In the sky there will be large kitchens where she boils for eternity. While sharing her happiness with her new friends, Babette changed their lives, gave them pleasure and a magical evening they would remember forever. In this simple but extraordinary manuscript, human warmth is everywhere and I wish everyone a Babette's feast would it just be for a starry night ...
