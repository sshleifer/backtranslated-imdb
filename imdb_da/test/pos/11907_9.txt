I think it was a great movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and strong man, but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him led to his destruction. It shows that you can't trust anyone, especially in a world of money and envy. The sign I looked most like was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, strong and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that business was business and dangerous. All she did was risky, but got the job done. She helped Kilo get rich in her relationships. Overall, I liked this movie and get it in my collection and wait for El Padrino 2.
