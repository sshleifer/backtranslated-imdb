Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us cinema classics like: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, decided long ago to adapt Shakespeare's famous game, 'Romeo and Juliet.' This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest, and managed to create a bizarre but hilarious movie. Anyone entering a Troma production should know what to expect, and it is irreversible and perverted comedy with lots of political inaccuracy. Expect lots of nodes for other Troma movies and lots of recycled gags (car flipping and headlamp). Many may think that it sounds like a complete shed that only morons would find fun ... they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and numbness that is Tromeo and Juliet. <Br /> <br /> With a great cast, a fun script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), an appropriate soundtrack and lots of great visual gags, Kaufman has once again succeeded in turning what is right on the head and break the hell out of everyone. Get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespeare fit with lots of balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
