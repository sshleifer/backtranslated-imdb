I'm really amazed at how little fame this movie had. I think it has to do with distribution companies and etc. Don't be idiots - if you are looking for a good fun, take this movie - it is very nice to pass some hours and music is great. It's about ..... good girls and boys and what's between them with not too much history, but not all movies should be PULP FICTION if they ?? It is lovely and sweet and gives good time. The girls are also very nice and it makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. Why did I just give it a 9? Well the story could be a little more convincing from the middle and beyond. At some point you begin to see events that are slightly less reliable. SMALL SPOILER: The child is crying and the father enters and tries to relax him. now i'm not talking about any little cry but non-hysterically crying and 30 seconds after the dad goes out and "baby sleeps" - excuse me when and how did you calm him down and sleep and could leave his room for 20-30 seconds. But ignore this kind of little picking because the movie itself is not Docudrama - it is fun and it should be overlooked.
