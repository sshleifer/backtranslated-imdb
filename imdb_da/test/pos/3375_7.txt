I'm not going to lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot, but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's former films, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales," you know it should matter. When I went to watch this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour in the movie, about half of the audience had already gone out. At the end there were only 15 people wondering what the hell they just saw. I for one could only understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because for one we get some spectacular performances (Marsden's great and Langella return as a well-known, skewed sign) and most importantly, because it's completely original and Richard Kelly is undoubtedly one of the boldest directors alive using his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly, it is the only way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be told as it is intended. Ultimately, if you are not willing to use a serious mindset in an intelligent movie (and even then it can't be anything), stay far away from it. But if you want to see a deep, abundant, complex, and thought-provoking piece on spirituality, existentialism, and predictability of human nature, you should see this. Be prepared for long discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If you have randomly read this review, taken my recommendation, you actually watched the movie and still think you've wasted 2 hours In your life I would like to share my views on the whole meaning and the plot of the movie. See, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! As hard as it is, I will try to sum it up by rewriting a rather depressing quote of Langella's character, explaining the importance of the simple box for an employee: "Your house is a box in which you live. Driving to work is a box of wheels, when you come home from work, you are sitting in front of a box of moving pictures, looking until the rock of the mind and soul and the body of your body when you finally get into the ultimate box ... to rest under the earth and the earth.
