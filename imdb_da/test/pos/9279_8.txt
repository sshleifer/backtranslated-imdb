Despite the previous reviewer's screed, this is a good pace and interesting documentary with lots of clips from the classic 1950s sci-fi movies that have influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their latest efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as the films discussed here, as William Cameron Menzies brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS, to name just one of the many titles examined, but this is still a remarkably good one overview of the 1950s paranoid sci-fi. Yes, it turns into a commercial for the warm remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS over the last fifteen minutes; You can turn it off. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see modern filmmakers remembering the movies that inspired them, even though they can't start to match the originals.
