This is better than the first. The movie opens up with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne pack up the bags and head to Tropicana while Jack tags together. People are shot, get glass through the throats, are greased with anvils, get stuck with ice cans, eyes hollowed out, head explosions, drownings, hangings, lobsters pushed into faces, split throats, freezing to death, killed by snowballs, arms torn, melted of anti-freeze, ice cones down the neck, hit face with pots and pans, fingers get 'bitten by, ice beams through the mouths, bitten on neck, exploding people, roasted snowballs and pushed into mixers. <br /> <br /> The snowballs are fun, they put it in a blender and turn it on, so say 'it was fun' they put in a waffle thing and it gets burned. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they begin to think of other ways to kill it and the snowball answers, "it's not nice" <br /> <br /> It was worth it when 10 bucks were used to buy this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
