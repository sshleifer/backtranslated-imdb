Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping's Latin teacher with strict attention to detail and thoroughness in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is seen as cold and unfair and not in contact with time. But after meeting stage actor Singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark), not just on a late supper after a performance in London, London is, but in an amphitheater in Greece his closed world begins to open. <br /> <br /> Goodbye. Chips are a MGM musical remake of the 1939 movie also from MGM. During this time the musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was in total shambles. When it was premiered in New York Los Angeles and London, music tracks remained intact, but when it came to the local main street theaters around the world, the sans songs were therefore making the movie shorter and gaped to the max. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s in the early 1990s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats of choice, music tracks became reinserted and the holes closed. Laserdisc, however, was the only format chosen to see goodbye Mr. Chips in Widescreen Letterbox Format. <br /> <br /> For some time, Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was only available on the original out of print Vinyl and Cassette Tape and can still be found today on Ebay. Thanks to the wonderful people at the Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the audio track has been digitally remastered and remixed to a 3 CD set with the completely reconstructed score, the original 1969 general release album score, and told sequences source music and interviews alot. You also get 1 unused song, which is a really lost gem, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, who would have been chosen instead of "You and I" before hand. <br /> <br /> This film is both a classic musical and a real tribute to teachers everywhere. I would definitely buy this movie if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony would put their money where their mouths are and get this movie restored from all master movie sources and put it on both DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles set back in place with all the extras you can find and stuff in one release.
