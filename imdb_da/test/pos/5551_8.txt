Lauren Heaven's debut film is well-aimed with a beautifully polished feel. There is a strong story that takes place with a meaningful point to everything, although at the end there is nothing that is solved, so the name Treading Water. The story is about a lesbian couple and their struggle with them for acceptance. 7.5 / 10
