In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers all over the world with his epic opus Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later he came up with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more amazing than its predecessor. In fact, it's not really a successor. It's more of a "midquel" as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Heimat cycle. <br /> <br /> The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and older brother (the controversy had to do with him as a minor while she was about 25 years old). Yet anger over these events, the young man never promises to fall in love again (a grandiose whose crooked scene) and decides to move to Munich (as the director himself did for about the same period) in the hope of becoming a professional composer after some years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover the time frame, each focusing on another person among Hermann's fellow students, people there as he is searching for a "second home country", be it music, movies or anything else where they can finally live peacefully. <br /> <br /> Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect fusion of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic sub-panels make it look like a soap opera. The other Heimat must be seen in its entirety to be careful, while some chapters of Heimat 1 can be seen as separate stories (especially the one about Hermann's teenage years). However, the style and content are pure auteur cinema with the well-known black / white / color transitions (actually a bit more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being emphasized by the relationship between Hermann and cell player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Chamber): they clearly love each other But they continue to engage in affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it is too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic about his characters (at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned that he says: "The Beatles are much better than us!"), Building whole episodes about dark controversial issues such as abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the key issues of the 60s (especially in the '68 revolution). Reitz also seems to have made this mini series especially for movie buffs, given the many movie references (including an excellent Casablanca quote) and clever jokes (an episode set in Venice, whose film festival had an important role in Heimat saga's success) . And since 1992, movie lovers have never stopped thanking him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever committed to celluloid.
