This is a great movie and is very smart to use the few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - the physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implicit) is mixed with calm and equally humorous stretches. So the horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but it should be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message from this movie is absolutely delivered with a sledge hammer. This is the movie, I always remember both players for.
