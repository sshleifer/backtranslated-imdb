OK .... so in minute 15 in the movie there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie arrived in me in a padded bag from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted info on the front. I am a programmer from a North American party, and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our boss as a potential starter who had been in the remote Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> Straight away I thought "this movie is not for us" (no dialogue with minute 15 ??) but continued to look at anyway. Now now. It was built and built and built and halfway in I was involved in this movie, because as you walk in the zoo, you are first reticent, but when you come to the dangerous snakes, you are completely there. <br /> <br /> This movie has a danger, not at all like the very hip WolF Creek, but because it is so completely "second" in every way form and shape and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of the most independent first-time helmets ie - grim weather, red neck intrigue, odd splice, eerie music, and a plot that, although imperfect and basic, has a bit in common with one of the 'big Aussie movies', ie. the cars that are Ate Paris, by Wier. But MODERN LOVE is not really a very Aussie movie in the form of Ocker-ishness and playful self-deprecation that permeates many of the country's films. It works on a more nightmare area from the start. No cell phones, no brand names, no in-pods, no gritty urban middle / class anxiety - just a guy married to a peek, an old Volvo and a little boy (son) who has weird teeth and chuck things around. Oh, and it's in the weird seaside village where people all look a little 'wrong'. Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ti Canoes) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. film fails - it stands up regardless of the "god-forsaken" country from which it comes out. Instead, it burns in a combed but entertaining puzzle that the film itself cannot solve - and here lies the weak connection ... What on earth does this movie have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The last minutes of the movie seem to give an answer or at least hints on one .... and when I sat and drank a coffee and ate my Hershey afterwards, everything I could convince was that this film's helmets, Alex Frayne , prob will have a lot of fun with this one./
