Successful movies on metaphysical topics are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good cause. You can make the big issue for youth ambitions, but Herzog does a great job. The point of the film is to show people, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise and The Golden Age. The image of each is unlike voice-over. Although the text of 'The Creation' (from Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the original wasteland, the scene no longer goes to illustrate the myth. It lies on the waste and on various types of destruction (fire, smoke, broken vehicles). The pictures from `Paradise 'are anything but that, and` The Golden Age' is dark comic ?? The highest culture is the strange road driving musical action. Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central purpose of creation, but the film does everything to undo this concept. Its mythological framework has no references in human historical time. There are no human signs to speak of. When a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot, the first suggestion is for the boy's point of view; At the end there is much more dog. Similarly, the lizard is a stronger character than the person who introduces it, and the turtle's partner hardly looks human with his big flippers. Animal stories and nature documentaries are always anthropomorphic, but Fata Morgana has none. The dunes are determined as a female body, but the similes cut both ways. Probably only people can distinguish easily between their creation and nature, and here planes and factories appear along with mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are all part of a wider natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog made a new twist on the idea as he traveled Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
