I agree with all the above comments. This show was a pleasure to see. Fun, witty, great play and zany set. It is always a thrill to find a show that is cleverly written, provided that the audience has brains and shows subtle humor. I would use good, hard earned money to watch it again on DVD. And as long as we ask for the Smart Series, which never got a chance ... What about DVD releases by Maximum Bob (another well-written, odd, and-nice show with a nice cast of characters.) And add to the list ... Middle Ages or Frank's Place. There is a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.
