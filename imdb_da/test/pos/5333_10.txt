Given the huge success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with Wallace and Gromit short animations, we now have the first (hopefully many) feature with the plastic characters that so many love. The DVD in the movie has proved to be the most durable and best used of my two children's many Christmas gifts for a long time. Plot of the movie is just enough, but the beauty of the W&G movies for me is the background story. There are lots of up front gags and slapsticks for kids and adults to enjoy, but the background is the killer for me. All in all a classic addition to an already classic filmography for Nick Park etal, and I would recommend fans and new watchers to watch this movie .... often.
