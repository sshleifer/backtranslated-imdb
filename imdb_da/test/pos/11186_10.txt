"Curse of Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was the sacred grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But to return to "Curse", what is beautiful about CMI is that it is not afraid to be themselves. It differs from the first two, but remains faithful to the Ron Gilbert productions (if only the same could be said of the fourth part of the series!). Voting is impeccable, with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, while completely different from the classic pixelated characters, is made beautiful. It's just amazing. And the music is amazing! It's never annoying and you never want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not too big a fan of romance, the romantic scenes and themes are not overwhelming at all. They also have the rare ability to come out as sweet instead of cheesy. It says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chickens. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's the classic MI element in humor. CMI is quite good at delivering deadpan lines, totally absurdist humor and simply fun. Gary Coleman makes a como as a budding young entrepreneur, and world events discreetly jabbed on without stepping out of the game. It is not quite fair to compare CMI to MI and MI2 because it really is in its own realm. Personally, I can never find a favorite between 3, as they are all completely different from each other. But if you want a good and good time with the flair in the classic series, I insist on giving this game a shot. You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
