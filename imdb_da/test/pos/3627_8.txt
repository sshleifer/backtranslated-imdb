The "old dark house" sub-genre, which dominated the early talkies, seldom fails to disappoint when we look at oldies today. Here is one that gives so many many suspicious characters, you have to wonder how they will be able to tie all the loose ends in the 6-wheel run. The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to avenge the Col. Walters (Berton Churchill), who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he'll die that night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. This doesn't sit well with Thelma (Irene Purcell) fianc√© of club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, late on the mega-budgeted HELL'S ANGELS (1930)) who wants him to stop the club and stop risking his own life. Brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life. Everyone leads to Walters newly acquired mansion on Long Island to await the killer. The Colonel may be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it is an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and perhaps even a ghost. Top Image Zasu Pitts is Nora, the housekeeper, who expects to see a spirit around every corner. Throw in a policeman (James Gleason) who is safe Brand is a criminal and we have a picture full of action and surprises. You will notice immediately that the scriptwriter was losing too many dialogues because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) a Hindu mystic (which films of that time were filled with) says "evil is coming." many times, and I lost count of how often Mrs Pitts says "something always happens to anyone!". There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the stereotypical stupid policeman and Roscoe Karns as Mr. Lyon's pal) serving as comedy help. The house itself is appropriately creepy in appearance (actually I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)) with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but somehow you never get a sense of danger . Maybe it's because no one in the movie and I mean no !! Are quite what they seem to be. But it all comes to an end; But to go into detail, it would ruin it for you. <br /> <br /> Look carefully for Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Capt. Engelhorn from KING KONG) to appear among the suspects. <br /> <br /> The CROWN CIRCLE is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable, and then there are no more others. I suppose you will enjoy it.
