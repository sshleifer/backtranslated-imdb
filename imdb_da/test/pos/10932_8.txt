"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise for a movie, and keeps the viewer interested. I didn't know anything about what was being done by the British until I read the other viewer comments. I can understand why it won a prize for filmography, because it was excellently presented and must have looked magnificent on a large theater screen. It seemed to be much more realistic than most Westerners in depicting how the West was more truly won. As well as the complexity of the characters it presents. The Indian-Sam Waterson character is particularly exciting. He seems to be brutal in the harsh environment he is conditioned on, but shows remarkable respect for the fragility he witnesses in the white men and women he meets. He is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his countries, but he has a limit to his revenge, even compassion when in power, and observes the white white man bent on revenge, as well as the girl he kidnapped after capturing a stage coach. As such, his character seems complex, but congruent with the hard countries he lived in and threatened by these intruders, he is not heartless in his connection with. The magnificent horse he rides is a critical link & It is interesting to note how this Indian man handles it, compared to the Martin Sheen character who has it in his possession and power for a time. "Eagle's Wing" is an extraordinarily western, a genre I am not attracted to, but I really appreciated this excellent offer that I would only judge for "A Man Called Horse".
