Jesse is once again delivering almost 12 months of hype about its upcoming production, finally reaching the dark world of the Internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur filmmaking. DBP is an original, narrative commentary on an uneasy child growing into an even more troubled adult. If I had more than two thumbs, I would give more, but I think two will be enough. Great work from all cast, especially by Marissa and Elizabeth, the character of Emily as an adult has given me shakes so far, and I'm afraid she'll go next. <br /> <br /> An excellent watch
