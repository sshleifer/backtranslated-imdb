This is a brilliant series in the same line with the Simpsons. For a family as they go through life and problems etc. A little less realistic than the Simpsons, does baby and dog talk to anyone? Family Guy goes where Simons or Futurama does not dare when passing in the sick jokes and more racy gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags hit the mark and they get you stitches (especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) When my brother first showed me this I wasn't hooked, but after a few episodes I was hooked. You will be 2nd 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. Congratulations to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
