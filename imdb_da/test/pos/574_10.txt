I am glad that this was the work of foreign film actors because it cannot be accused of unfair prejudice. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville police rush to judge in this case and choose the first black suspect to accuse the murder of a white foreign tourist. They chose a 15 year old. Old kids who are almost as close to a saint as you could find by chance and then fool themselves by trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustices arising from the obvious prejudices, there are six months of unjustly imprisonment by a completely innocent young black teenager. It makes a question of whether we as a society should compensate those who are being charged, imprisoned and subsequently found innocent. This docudrama is well-crafted, professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you will not take a 1-minute break. If you worry about social justice, don't miss this one. It certainly deserved its Oscar.
