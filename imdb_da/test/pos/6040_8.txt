Elizabeth Ashley receives phone calls from her nephew Michael - he cries, screams and asks for help. The problem is Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie scared me stupidly back in 1972 when it was broadcast on ABC. See it again, years later, it still works. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit slow and predictable, the deaths are very tame and there is a buggy ending, but it's a TV movie so you have to give it space. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is ok and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And these phone calls still scare the live daylight out of me. I actually had to turn on one of them! <br /> <br /> An eerie little TV movie. Worth to see.
