I don't have to say much about how good this documentary is - it's really a great piece of true storytelling. The story is simple enough: A white senior citizen is murdered by a young black man in Florida, and the boy arrested is abused and brought to justice with only the public defender and his family on his side. It is very exciting and the public defender is happy to look at all his human ways - you can't help pulling for the triumph of justice, and the end meets more than you might expect from a true story. <Br /> <br /> It's a shame more people haven't seen this documentary, but hopefully you'll find a way to look at it. For those who are interested in racial relations in the United States and the actual enforcement of law enforcement and legal process, it is worth using your time and effort to find this documentary. I give it a 10.
