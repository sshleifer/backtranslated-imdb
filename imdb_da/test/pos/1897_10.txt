The best so bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether we have the daily life or the pimping ho is down in the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. No one is milder. See Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killer take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that more views are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a few lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool. If you're in the mood for a ridiculous uprising, rent this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather and Petey Wheatstraw Devil's Son-in-Law. Now you can dig it? <br /> <br /> "You have no business lock, uncertain, rat soup eat, motha !!" "
