A horror image that is ultimately parody, but still in play, may frighten some of those who are confused or slightly abominable when they see what is under their skin. I laughed it though. It was easy to decipher the true killer and his plays did not help. This only led Potente to look even better. Anatomy is not much of a horror picture for the foreign genres, but they contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting top of German horror cinema. 6.10
