Written by someone who has been there, you can tell, but only if you have been there. Excellent performance by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. Many people have said it is a dysfunctional family. I think every family is dysfunctional when faced with this kind of pain. NOT being dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You lose your family as you know, can something be worse? People need to watch this movie, so when they face this nightmare, they might change how they do it. Maybe they will see that the father refuses valuable time, he never gets a chance again. Perhaps they will realize how difficult it is to die or to see someone you love to die. They didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
