Ghoulies 4 is quite a ghoulish successor. The ghouls look very different from the first three ghoulies, but there is still cool. There are some great flashbacks from Ghoulie's first movie. Jonathan is back in this one. However, he was not in part 2 or 3. The film is low budget at times, but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. Ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, instead of evil as in the first three films. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have the very hot Alexandra! It's a great dark comedy and fun! Any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching the Ghoulies 4. The DVD finally comes out in July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the United States. I would also like to see a sequel to this movie one day too. I doubt it will happen though. It is 2007 now and no sign of a successor yet. If there is ever a successor, I hope Jim Wynorski will do it. <br /> <br /> I give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
