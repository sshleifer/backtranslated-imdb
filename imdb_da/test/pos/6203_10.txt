Have drama, excitement and character development you will enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains and educates. The authors know their material and it shows. The direction is always engaging and does not blow, and the play is amazing. Why this show does not win any prizes tells me "the powers that are" in Hollyweird do not know drama or much else for that matter. <br /> <br /> There is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played. I am pleased that it was not used as a shocking scene for any climatic end to this series that would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! Let's hope it's come back from celluloid extinction.
