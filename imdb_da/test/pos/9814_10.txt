In response to "state of confusion", the dog's injuries seem to disappear quite steeply, but it may have only been a failure in continuity. But for the kids who are trying to build an aircraft out of junk, it's just a simple question of imagination. There are two very young children who have extremely active fantasies, and they have to rely on these fantasies to stay out of being exposed to the reality of the abuse going on in their home from their grandfather. As for the stiffener, it is very interesting that the director chose not to show his face. It makes him seem more monstrous. If you show your face, it becomes a character and not just this "monster" that terrorizes the infancy of these two innocent children. By only showing the events of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children become the main movie for the film. This movie has no loose ends, but runs just like a father's tale to his children would. It has decorations. This is a fine American classic.
