As Salingsers' "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with the suicide of a marvel, this film opens with the death of the star school swimmer's legend, Matt, shooting his head with a revolver in the opening scene. But Matt Travis's death serves as a key to locking the door to another marvel, his brother Tim, who never seriously disturbed the question "What should I do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, his head broken like a fallen watermelon, the Travis family begins to cast out his secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic use, family extension, heartache, sexuality and friendship issues. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his wounds to physical bruises, but these are not the only injuries to his person that we are slowly going to realize as the script painfully reveals the origin and outcome of Tim Scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character quite well and reveals frame by frame in his body's visual expression, a wealth of conflicting emotions inside a child's soul, which no one seems to listen to or know very well, ignorant and ignorant of his depth of soul and wonderful talent. <br /> <br /> Two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red, spindly playground bowl, asks Tim Penny, "What should I do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed in a familiar, recurring picture of the movie: The comfortable playground, where Tim obviously feels at home, filmed from the bird's eye view, for Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself, and we see these intimate moments he shares in it red, spinnable playground bowl, complete with childish graffiti cut with pencil, from above. After advising him carefully to pass the collection, Penny tells him: "Tim, well, the secret of life is finding something you love. And you have to do it for the rest of your life? And you better hope for hell that you are good at it, because if you are not then you will probably fail. "This simple advice from Penny serves as the central theme of the movie, the talent of the talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have a talent that he cannot stand, just as Matt, who hated that attention, brought his swimmer's fame, but no one notes Tim's talent ?? none ?? because no one bother to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware that we don't even know Tim as well as we thought we did when we first met this beautiful, sad guy; In our intimate understanding of Tim as it progresses, we remember that not everyone is as they seem to be. This is the other side of the film, let down by those who were supposed to? parents, friends, teachers ?? whoever ?? to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, despite his love for her son. Weaver does a skilled job of a medieval woman who breaks with her own inner demons as she accompanies the quest to play the role of household and support. When Tim is bullied at school, she storms the boy's trailer and threatens her life: "You can justify, torture, throw, drive full of me, I can forgive you. Hell I can understand, I'm good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you mess with my child and may God himself come down from heaven to protect you, for as long as I live and I will survive all of you? I will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming about ways to make your petty insignificant life hell on earth. "After throwing a paper cup in the mother's face, she looks around the trailer and looks at both of them, the child and his anesthetized mother, commenting on" nice trailer "and leaving as fast as she came. Weaver assesses in his ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is sour and witty. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, treats him like a stranger, does not tell his family that he took time from the office, ate his days in the city park, spotless, a carved soul, and slept in Matt's bed, hidden in his high school letter jacket. Jeff Daniels does a great job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because we grow to see that even an unfortunate father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. When you think his father is going to beat him, he takes him to embrace him. Don't let him go, he tells Tim: "I'm your father, and you're my son, and I'm here okay, but you need to talk to me. I don't know how to do it myself". It is here at the moment in the movie that a father tells his son, you must tell me what's going on inside you, tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and alone, until his father embraces him as he breaks down and cries and reveals the feelings hidden under his shell. Tim is experiencing this moment of cleansing with his father as a catharsis, especially when considering abuse, manipulation, absenteeism, violence and fraud, he has been treated for the long time the film includes. I recommend this movie.
