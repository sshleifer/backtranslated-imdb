Inspired by Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN concept of two men switching swords in exchange to get rid of the two people who break their lives, THOMM MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is an original and highly inventive comedy. It's a credit to Danny DeVito that he both wrote and starred in this smaller comedy gem. <br /> <br /> ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspires the title of the movie and it is understandable why she comes under DANNY DeVITO's skin with her sharp tongue and relentlessly put him down for any minor offense. BILLY CRYSTAL is the author whose wife has stolen his book page and is now being lionized as a great new writer, who even appears on the Oprah show to bask in adulation to enjoy. Thus, DeVito gets the idea of ​​swapping murders to rid itself of these genes. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything and everything can happen when author Carl Reiner lets his imagination roam with endless ideas of how the plot evolves. And it's entertaining all the way through, giving lots of laughs and chuckles along the way, as well as a lot of excitement. For fans of black comedy, this is guaranteed to please.
