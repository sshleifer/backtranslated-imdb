seriously people need to light up and just accept that fun is fun, and this movie is f ** king hilarious. Better than the first and Knoxville really grew a couple for this movie and made much more crazier stunts so the first. If Ebert and Roper (don't say I'm a big fan of theirs) can see past the pure idioci of this movie enough to give it 2 thumbs up then I think other people can. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I was the floor and it's rare when a sequel is better than the original. This new one I think exceeds the first big time. so do what i did, just relax spades again, try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass away.
