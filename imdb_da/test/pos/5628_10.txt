When I don't give 150% to my dreams or goals, I'm thinking of Mark Borchardt, the real subject of "American Movie". Mark's endurance by having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will make you laugh and shake his head with grief and rooting for him. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a documentary this honest side movie on R. Crumb. It supports "cast" (Mark's family and friends) are all good. Give this movie a try and you'll see a fantastic movie and a wonderful portrait of the things that the American dream is made of.
