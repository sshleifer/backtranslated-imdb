Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard about the movie being released, I want to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse didn't return and B) too much slapstick. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the successor because it may not be good as the first movie, but it is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns as ultracool damermand Match, who has a stable girl in Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as the crazy Alien (this time sporting a mohawk and talking a lot English!). The real star of the movie is beginner Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance by Agent Curtis ... he seems to be the hard one as nails, smartmouth FBI Agent you will love to hate ... but soon you will want to have his character. <br /> <br / The battle scenes are much better in this one, though there are very few, but they are big, grateful by Jackie Khan's stuntman Nicky Li. Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a burkfighter who has a teeny little fight with Match. Smoorenburg is also stunt-double to Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you liked GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS !!!
