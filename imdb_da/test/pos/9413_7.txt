Maverick director Seijun Suzuki was finally able to film his dream project, "Princess Raccoon" and somehow, fortunately, he didn't try it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics made this kind of production easier to achieve than the old film mat technology would have. <br /> <br /> Some knowledge of Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help enjoy this movie. Much as familiar with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" would help Peter Greenaway's close "Prospero's Books". These two films actually have a bit in common, though "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to look for for someone without the background to fully appreciate it. <br /> <br /> While art design, acting and direction are fine for most of the movie, it looks to this viewer that the energy runs out in the final third of the movie. Most of the interesting sets have already been introduced, and the camera seems to be stepping down for more of a filmed scene experience. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a unique movie experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of movie performance. It is not really intended for children, even though nothing would disturb them. If the last third was better, I would have given it nine stars.
