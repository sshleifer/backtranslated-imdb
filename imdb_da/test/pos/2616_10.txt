This episode is not incoherent as another person said. the source agreed to help because he would not keep his word if you were watching ... he says after she (phoebe) agrees to stay down there in hell: "GET THERE AND BALTPHAS, I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ABOUT THEM IN THE FUTURE "... and also, he did not let COLE WARN SISTERS LIKE PHOEBE QUESTION IN BUILDING TO ACCEPT THE DISSERTATION, that's why YOU DIED, because she was hit harder than PIPER and upside down, and there was no PHOEBE to call LEO this time, and earlier, LEO said she was immediately killed. Be aware next time! and there is not a "CONTINUE" ... after this episode. This is the end of season 3, and in season 4 they can't show anything from PRUE because she owns the rights to the "PRUE" so producers have to pay her for what they show. this is the last episode she is in!
