Greystoke is without a doubt the best tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert depicts a very trustworthy man trying to return to the world of humanity along with the amazing Ian Holm. John's struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys who raised him touches quite a bit. Some very memorable scenes, including where Lambert makes the jungle sound to the romantic interest, and the scene where he testifies of his ape's father died. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and make you feel like him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underrated movie.
