I remember watching this movie as a child in the 60's. It took my breath away at a young age. I was glued to my seat in front of the black and white TV. The cast was one of the best I've seen in my life. The music was the largest ever written. Please visit Gershwin and Goldwyn Families, please give it here on video or DVD so that the generations now and in the future can see what I am sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art. Not this great man's work goes unseen for years more. I, I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will softer and let the world see this amazing movie again.
