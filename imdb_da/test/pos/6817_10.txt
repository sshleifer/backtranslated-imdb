I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before his premiere at the Sundance Festival 2005. In twelve short but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he explores one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues in Our society. The film includes elegant direction, moving notions and a heartbreaking story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas exude as the two lovers. And in his first venture in dramatic narrative, Leonard shows to be a director with a favorable future. I feel this short must be extended to a feature film. It's hard to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!
