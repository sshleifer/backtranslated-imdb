Have you ever found yourself watching a movie or documentary and having to stay away from screaming things like "No! Don't!" None? Now is the time you do. And without a doubt, DEEP WATER is the first to get started. The story is based on Donald Crowhursts and his entry into the first round-of-the-earth competition to be conducted by individuals in 1968. The word "individuals" is important as the men who go on this almost suicidal escapade run out alone. Most men are known in the English seafaring communities (where they launch), but one of them is the "unknown dark horse" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Fighting financially, Crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him if he fails to at least try to do it through much of the race. He could take his home, his property, everything. Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ... well ... deep water: either try the race with an unconscious ship and an unconscious captain, or lose everything you own (which was important since Crowhurst had a wife and more children) . You will also notice the term "unconscious captain" in there as well. Not only was he unconscious, he had never been on the high seas! Did I mention suicide? Flickering between the archive film from the pre-and after-run, and those of Crowhurst's friends, family and acquaintances today, Deep Water is assembled masterfully. Originally seen as a bad sap that came across his head, the movie gradually shows the limited choices Crowhurst had after months and months on the water. His ship is delicious. Equipment breaks. Psyche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal fight without success. It is also interesting to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on board their respective boats. The wave-like feelings that you will feel while watching this amazing documentary can make you a little sick (not unlike trying to get your sea legs). And you will probably be frustrated with the choices being made; maybe as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. The ending is also great because we see the actual ship, Crowhurst sailing, sitting desolate and on a Caribbean beach ... not unlike other things that felt desolate and rotting towards the end of this poorly thought-out race. <br /> <br /> Amazing.
