"Hell to Pay" counts itself as the resurrection of the classic western ... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the whole family could see and not unlike the movies that baby-dwellers experienced decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all good and it's fun to watch them again. James Drury really shines in this one, perhaps even better than his days as "Virginian." In a way, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of the 60's films where actors you know from so many shows get a look. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith give a "wow" factor because we rarely see these icons these days. "Hell To Pay" contains the screen legend along with recent names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of "newbies" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I have seen lately about "The Young and the Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays the dreaded Kirby, a warrior torn between wanting to live and leave live or step in to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is excellent as a Chance, Kirby's evil and woman's brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a rather creepy middle stripe, plays. I think we will see more of these fine actors in the future. "Hell to Pay" is a fun movie with a great story to tell ?? Grab the popcorn, we have the head 'West!'
