Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the movie we see her arriving home late. When her older mother protests, Erika goes into a madness and attacks the elderly woman with no pity. Erika, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of some fame in the conservatory where she learns. When we next see her, she is a model of calm, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels that he is wasting his time and her. The same goes for the insecure Anna, a talented girl whom Erika hates, perhaps because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we see Erika as she enters an amusement area and moves on to one of the cottages where pornographic material is shown. Erika is transfixed as she looks at the things that are done on the screen. On another occasion, Erika comes to a driveway where there is a movie going on. Her attention goes to a parked car where two lovers perform a sex action. The camera leans on Erika as she is lost in reverie and sees what the two lovers do until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. Erika flies horribly, she has been discovered. <br /> <br /> When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform in a recital in their lavish home, she meets an avid young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's game; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to compliment Erika is met with skepticism from her side. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class and is accepted. <br /> <br /> Thus, Walter starts the persecution of Erika, who is surprised when she understands what the youth's motives really are. In return, Erika begins to fantasize about Walter in ways that only her mind could imagine what she wanted him when, and if they came together. Walter is turned off by the letter Erika has written to him and describes sexual acts that are contradictory to the young man. <br /> <br /> The movie's ending reminded us of the last order of Mr. Haneke's current "Cache". We are taken to a concert hall where the Erika must perform. She is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter who enters the hall without noticing her. Erika's expression of the camera reveals much more of his state of mind in the last minutes of the film. As she flies in the lobby area after applying a wound to herself, the camera leaves her and concentrates on the building's facade, which looks long on the screen. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress makes one of her best performances on the screen, guided by Michael Haneke's secure hand, one of the most interesting directors working today. Mrs Huppert works with economic movements, but she designs as much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. The support noise does wonders under the instructor's guidance. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key to what went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtlety associated with the movie. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the movie as the young man, so in love with a woman obsessed with demons, that he will never be able to chase away or make her love him in a normal way. /> <br /> Michael Haneke movies are always disturbing to look at, but they give so many rewards because he dares to go where other men don't. The magnificent music that is heard in the film is mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's own favorites. The film has been hugely helped by Christian Berger's film.
