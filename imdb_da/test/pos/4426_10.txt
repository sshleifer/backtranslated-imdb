I have just returned from seeing this academically-award-nominated doc, and I was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this guy I had never heard of before. Of course I am a person who is imprisoned with beautiful architecture, so I realize others do not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were a few more visionaries in Philadelphia back in the late 60s when Kahn Plans was an option, which wonderful center would be. If you are wondering if you want to see more about Bangladesh's building at the beginning of the movie, be patient because it will bring climax to the movie at the end. <br /> <br /> His son's personal discoveries in the process of making this movie are quite interesting, sometimes touching and even fun at times. There is one of the most comic anti-visionary ranks ever captured on the camera. <br /> <br /> Rounding off the good points in this document is a touching musical score with some excellent, expressive string music. And expressiveness is an important point in Kahn's architecture. The points that other architects made about the material nature of the material and how Kahn's buildings brought it together tie the overall experience of this film together.
