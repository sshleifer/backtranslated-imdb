Will Smith is perfect endearing as "Relationship Doctor" here to cure your entire disturbance. I expected this to be a standard RomCom with a little to entertain. I'm happy to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is lovely and unexpectedly "fresh" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a huge backing, an interesting story and fed a witty dialogue, I was thoroughly engaged. <br /> <br /> We found this one sweet, quirky and inspiring without being preaching. <br /> <br /> It ranks a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
