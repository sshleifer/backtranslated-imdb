After growing up in Canada I saw this card most often at CBC. I have seen it many times, for many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that draws on your heart. I'm sure I have some VHS tape somewhere to dig around. <br /> <br /> Every child grows up can relate to the situation and wants to fit in with your favorite gods. The scene and look at the kids faces when his mother completes the Eaton catalog, and his jumping around the room is invaluable. I have not seen anyone capturing the carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short haired. Of course I am a Montreal fan fan, and that makes my recognition for it more special. But in the end, it's the nostalgic look of women's hockey, and the memories of your family tell you to be great for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you wanted. And oh yes, the animation is also beautiful;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
