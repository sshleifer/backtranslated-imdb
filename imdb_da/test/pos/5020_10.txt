This movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I'm sorry that IMDb is not more positive about it. I hope it does not keep those who have not experienced it from seeing it. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie. I see it about once a year and am always delighted recently with the film and especially the stellar performances of the entire cast. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered if Jean Stapleton actually ended the dance with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows this piece of trivia, please have a comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and Enjoy!
