Someone on these boards has assumed that the whole thing is dreamed by the protagonist's best friend, though a friend he hasn't seen for about 20 years. I am reluctant to dismiss this out of hand, but it raises some viable issues. Why does a phone operator - or a shoe dealer or butcher for that matter - want to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend who fills it in the process of a set of just mythical supporting characters. With a fantasy so good, the friend should NOT write dreams. Dream or not Someone, and the obvious candidate's director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very visible world where Tony Servillo makes silence into an art. We are asked to believe that some people watch La Girolomo (Servillo) "disturb" the mafia some years before our meeting with him and as a punishment he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel from which every week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mills large in used notes. Apart from this weekly journey, he is free to do as he likes, and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the man how far they have fallen socially and ignore Olivia's friendly overtures Magnani, who spent two years trying to get a smile and / or a "good night" out of him. For reasons that are best known for themselves and which are incompatible with a man who is not interested in anything or anyone, Servillo uses some time each day to apply a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listen to the private conversations by his card player partners. Eventually he answers Magnani - he must do it, or they wouldn't be movie. This is plot 6f: the one about Destry who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the "quiet man" who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the mandatory scene where the gun is attached and the fists lit up - but instead of satisfying himself with a polite comeback and also he removes 100,000 from his suitcase and buys her a car. The final disagreement occurs when Magnani tells him that she will pick him up the following day at. 16 in their car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate their birthday. We have stated that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive away from the road and overthrow the car is someone guess. This discrepancy from one another remains a fine piece of film making with an excellent management performance and a very good supporting.
