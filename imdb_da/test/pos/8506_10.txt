I like both this version of the DORIAN GRAY and MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story that grows up to have a connection to Dorian (this is not in the original book) and that's my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version looks much better (and I think) and much more reckless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more true to the novel Dorian. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even suggests Dorian's relationship with men, like Wylde, which could not be done in the MGM version).
