Yes, yes, we have a winner-a winner in the best stupid-action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad it actually gets fun. "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission is to kill the last remaining Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie features one of the cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun shooting scenes. When people are shot in this movie, the blood splatter - thick as ketchup everywhere, it makes the film seem so cheap and inhibit that you just lose interest. A constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me most during battle scenes. This is probably done to create an "action effect", although in my opinion it does not produce any effect. It's totally ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are performed extremely poorly. For example, a scene where the dead vampire leader is thrown off a roof. When the body hits the ground, it pops out like a wobbly rubber doll. A scene where Jack sniffs the earth, getting a vision was so boring, it made me laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> Lame music, cheesy scenes, bad acting and plain stupid movie techniques are of course the features that make this movie such a malfunction. Informing that this is a good movie would be the same as saying that nuclear weapons are good for humans. Obviously, those of you who say this is one of the best action movies haven't seen many in your life. This is basically a B-class vampire action movie that deserves 1/10 but which I will give 10/10 just for its ability (being the lousiest action movie I've ever seen) to make me laugh and because I just can't live without it.
