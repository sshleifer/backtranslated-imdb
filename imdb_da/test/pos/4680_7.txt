If you're looking for a movie that is fast witted and doesn't want to drill you then this is the place. It's fast and fun with some decent plays that come from the characters. It's always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything other than Marky Mark. That image is burned in my mind forever. As an actor, he is quite good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few small twists. I have to choose this movie one day and buy it.
