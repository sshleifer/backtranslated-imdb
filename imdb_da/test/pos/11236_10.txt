Keys to VIP, an original series of the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining but inspirational game. This show is hosted by four fun, beautiful men who judge others on their 'games' (the ability to gather women). Each episode has two guys who head in different pick-up games. There are three different sections, and the winner scores one night as a VIP in an exclusive Toronto nightclub. Of course, to be a guy, I find this show fun. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and looking at these guys makes it naturally sparkle men's curiosity. The guys competing for this show can even give you a few tips - if you are aware.
