Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do 'zany', but the British do 'witty' - and they love to throw fun on themselves (ahem: unpleasant teeth, big lips / nose, 'veddy' joint or 'veddy' snobby, obsession with 'gahden'). Inside the jokes for the older folk in the audience, lots of action for the kids. Subtle use of devices from other classic movies (look for 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones ..', 'Harvey', 'Tremors' .. and more). Also a beautiful 'buddy' movie (Gromit is a quiet but resourceful sidekick). Add brilliant voice work by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true? The best play these days is going on in animation?) - Enjoy! I saw it with the grandchildren. fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
