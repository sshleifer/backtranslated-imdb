When Wallace and Gromit were on stage in their academically award-winning "A Grand Day Out" card, they created a new new look at claymation. After another two shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned to this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation that only Aardman could do! <br /> <br /> In this movie, Wallace and Gromit run "Anti-Pesto," a rabbit flying company. When the word comes out about a "Ware-Rabbit" that eats all the vegetables in town, a madness arises. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the city's beautiful toupee-brandishing huntsman, will get the hands of the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues? <br /> <br /> The knowledge I should say was funny. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's, booty crack showed, which got a sign to cry: "BEWARE ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Earthman! <br /> <br /> The characters are sharp and fun. Our favorite Aardman team of men and dogs entertain us as they only could, earning them their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was great as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially fun and vain as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the pastor whose antics turned out to be some funny comic relief. <br /> <br /> Hats off to Aardman to create another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
