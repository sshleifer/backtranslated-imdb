This was my second experience of the Monkey Island series, seven years after showing the first game. What was my answer? "Oh, well, we are playing a cartoon." I'm glad my brother shut me up and played, because the jokes again got my attention, as well as Armato's wonderful voice-acting by Guybrush - not to mention everyone else did well (I still think CMI's Elaine sounds better than EMIs). The cut scenes make it good to illustrate something that happens and the art in both the game and the cut scenes is excellent. When we found the CD of the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through Revenge - such a moment was where we just sat and blew half a day on it. However, CMI must be the Monkey Island game I've played the most, especially for the return of sword fighting and open sea combat. That moment when you come across Kenny and he tells you he's gone right now, "I'm running arms!" both my brother and I had tears from laughter. And it's not the best part of the game, not far.
