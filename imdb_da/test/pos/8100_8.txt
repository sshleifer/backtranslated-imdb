Okay, it's too far, and it's too happy with itself. Yet "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin does a terrific work of satirizing Hitler and is trying to portray the Jews' repression in Nazi Germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). Not a Chaplin masterpiece, but still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
