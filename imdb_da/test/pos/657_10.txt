I saw the first movie in 1980, and it touched a lead reminding me of a more innocent time. The opening story, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was best at the time and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in an innocent and touching manner. This movie is at the top of my favorites at all times, a shame it is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The finish was also wonderful. John Hancock did a fantastic job capturing the essence of time.
