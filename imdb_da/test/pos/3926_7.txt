** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Yet another classic horror movie rebuilt with thunder-headed teen acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price movie House of Wax where a madman kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and makes them priceless wax figures. Yet with the stunning set of designs to make the whole house wax, the movie is a typical classic scare reaction that Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later recreated, despite creativity and so in reality the movie was still a gorilla image. Director Serra showed mild enthusiasm with his director but still worth seeing. My last rating 7/10.
