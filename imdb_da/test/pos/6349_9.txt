This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted student, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married to two sons, and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder) and disappointment (the youngest). His passion for poetry makes him an object of love for a senior student in one of his classes. The student Choi Lam draws pictures of him during the class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from the mouth. She harasses him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although it is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to her attention, even though he tries to keep the boundary line between teacher and student in place. <br /> <br /> The reason he didn't succeed in the end is complicated. First, there is a real depth in the communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she really likes him and it is mutual. Secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage, which is enlightened when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear. Nothing is treated trivially in this movie. All the characters have a living inner life and an easily recognizable story. The two leaders, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are excellent, like Karena Lam as the Choi Lam student and Shaun Tam as the oldest son On Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
