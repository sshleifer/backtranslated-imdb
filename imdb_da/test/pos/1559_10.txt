I didn't expect a whole lot when I rented this movie, as many independent movies seem to be a little overstated these days (well, Hollywood movies too for that matter), but this movie was great, really good, it's for poorly it did not reach a large audience because it was just amazing. I really love Alice's determination, it makes me look at my life as a gift, and I see how privileged I just need to have an education. But all this aside shows this movie really that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget is, it's a great movie, and everyone has to see it, they will love it and definitely learn something from it. I don't have to be roger ebert to know that this is one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful ones.
