Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse dealers forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and lead them across the border to a solution. What they do not expect is to encounter the infamous Clegg killers, with their wounded leader Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond shows Elder Wiggs, the main voice of the Mormon group, moving the lane to the Lord's destination. Along the way, they also encounter "Doctor" A Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and lend them help. <br /> <br /> Lovingly directed by Ford, which attaches great importance to details with realistic problems, any group will come under a robust track. The movie has a wonderful cast of character actors with Nary a real star in the movie, which is actually a blessing to see, if not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. Comes really good, but it's Bond's movie to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand the ruffians and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly benefit when certain conflicts develop as Clegg boys run along them a bit. <br /> <br /> I have to say it is one of his best and least appreciated westerns and seems to float very well.
