Okay, it was the first time I saw "Talk Radio" in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, and I watched it, and I thought it might be Howard Stern because I just looked on it for about thirty seconds, so didn't see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and I found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone and I picked it up. So after the movie was over, I was speechless. I've never seen such a movie like this one. Here is the most important plot, so I will tell you what I thought about it. <br /> <br /> It's about a Dallas talk radio hosted by Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about what other people bring up and he interupts and takes everything seriously. Now a network will put its show live everywhere in the United States. So Barry's show gets many interesting phone calls like Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a rock n roll-killed child), John (rapist) and others. Now some of the calls sound like the same actor / actresses. But I still think it fits okay. <br /> <br /> Now, what I love a lot about this movie is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background also fits very well. It also has a flashback scene in the movie, how he started with the radio, which I think they did well. <br /> <br /> But the big thing about the movie ends. I was surprised at it and it gives you a bit of paranoid a little about phone calls from the air and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to tell the right things to people over a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stones' underestimated / weakest films mentioned, but I think it's his best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But definitely get this movie if you like movies with paranoia-like movies with a dark atmosphere with vicious music in the background. I'm still looking a lot at this movie now, when I'm bored, as a matter of fact, I saw tonight. Yes, if you really want to get the scary movie feeling, watch it at night with the lights off. I might be crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I didn't think the movie did so well was perhaps in my view because of the title. Talk Radio. It doesn't sound very difficult or something that is a bit common. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or maybe "The Abusive Radio Host" or something catchy and not common "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone didn't usually use Universal I don't think. Paramount could have been a good company. I don't know anything about this movie didn't make it so good, but I love it.
