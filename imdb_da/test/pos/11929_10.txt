These kind of movies don't get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd all-time favorite movie. (Stand By Me is 1st.) The reason I saw this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the world and I think he has done a great job in this movie and so did Sean Astin. I just saw it last night and it just surprised me. Everything in the film is very unusual. The script, the play, the manuscript. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mother wasn't in the room, I'd definitely be cold when Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I didn't see it coming !! All !! I was really surprised when I heard that it wasn't really popular back in the 90s. I was born a few years after it came out, so of course I didn't understand it in the theaters, but I was sure I would have if I would have lived. If any of my friends saw this, they would be like, "okay okay?" But it is just because they are not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven't seen this movie or want to see something that is the bomb, it's the movie for you to watch.
