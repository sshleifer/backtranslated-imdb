Fortunately for Bill Murray, this is such an easy project as he has to carry it. Meatballs are the story of rental housing Northstar and how its advisers deal with both the campers and each other. Then there is a lot of their rich rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk, culminating in a two-day Olympiad competition. All over, Bill Murray is clowning around and making a pretty memorable movie debut. <br /> <br /> The movie is littered with medium laughs, chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laugh comes from the pranks played on nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving their bed outside in different places while he is sleeping. Morty or "Micky" who everyone calls him wakes up along a road, stretches up some trees several feet above the ground and finally floats on a fleet in the middle of the lake! There are also some fun moments where advisers hit each other, but this is a PG-rated movie with little in the way of raunchiness. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a serious note with a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course, it is up to Murray to teach the child how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympics. Rudy's situation is largely seen in the sentiment. Notice how Murray first sees the baby sitting alone in the grass after turning off the bus, he says to him: "You must be the short depressed child we ordered." Make you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras rolled. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, "you must be the actor we've employed to play the stereotypically lonely child you see in most summer camp movies that don't fit." But before it's over, Murray's performance makes this plot unit more than tolerable. He really seems to have good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The movie culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even a bit credible, but "it's just as important". This is a pretty good movie on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this movie be scared of you at the moment. Murray will keep you laughing all the way through. Just be warned ..... avoid successors !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. The dog.
