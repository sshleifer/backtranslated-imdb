The previous users' comments are tough. One wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet movie. As if to be so uncomfortable about it in front of the author / director .. yes it's just pretty rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artificial piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. Irish filmmaking has many bitter angry people involved in it, and the spleen venting comment whether this is a sign of it. As people, we have a choice; give out and moan about the people who actually go out there and do things or do something themselves. I know which one is easier ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short film is made ... you will not be disappointed
