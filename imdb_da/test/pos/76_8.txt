I suppose I like this movie as well as anyone I know; it is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire, I have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized his particular Blake Edwards-produced gentleness, clever humor and solid story . The unlikely but glorious storyline follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passes as Smith helps his uncle, who is also patriotic, for Germany, but neither cruel nor political, just opportunistic. Lili's goal is William Larrabee, a charismatic American squadron leader who can provide her valuable information. The reason, when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has opened her eyes to the consequences of her spy and sees the effects of fighting on wounded men in a hospital and understands what it can mean for his men she has met and liked. She becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's feelings, so she realizes that she can no longer do what she has done and gives up the spy. The logical end of the movie comes when the terrible WWI is completed when she sings the movie's theme song, "Wishing" in a darker theater, appears one of them Larrabee's squadrons, including her lover herself and indicates them have forgiven her and their past opponents and even Uncle Kurt enters the song of "It's a Long To Tipperraree" enthusiastically to indicate that everything is good with the world again. This is an awesome and once brilliant story idea written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of "John Goldfarb" fame; And it's a nice story. Larrabee's squadron, including an inebriate holding crashes and other lovable types, fills this lively movie; And the feeling of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and accomplishment. Credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to Russell Harlan for his shiny film. In the beautiful recording, the major actors Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp are excellent as Lili's Uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot, the beautiful Gloria Paul as Lili's striptease rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough good things about the pace or gap of the straight-side-wide comedy; This element was introduced by Edwards to suspend the horrors of actual warfare, for example, the almost comic opera approach by which men retreated into a more innocent mind with human civilization. This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lili's transformation from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she can cause. This is a rare "sense-of-life" movie about Lili's "Americanization", her claim of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. It is joking, I find and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be Blake Edwards' masterpiece to govern; And under the title "The Americanization of Lili" I think with almost no change it could have been recognized as a polished sapphire in a movie, it is by every standard I know.
