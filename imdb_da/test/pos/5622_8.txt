Chris Smith is a superior filmmaker with the rare talent to spot a good story and then get hell out of the way. Smith's "American movie" is the true life-movie of filmmaker Wannabe Mark Borchardt, a loser sensation of killing his older uncle for money to complete his horror short. But never under any circumstances to pursue paid employment or support the children he is conceived of. <br /> <br /> That's how Smith's skill is, Mark seems more sympathetic than otherwise. Even when he lures Uncle Bill with sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, it's his desperation to be someone to get his name combined with similar scoring and spielberg that touch us. <br /> <br /> "American Movie" also belongs to the rare, often tried but rarely obtained subgenre that successfully blends hilarity with horror. The mood comes from Borchardt's Ed Wood style belief in his own genius. From his horrible attempt to appear, he replaces his less than cinematic mother for a missing cameraman and from his hiring sweet but brain-injured friend Mike when he is short of an actor or crew member. <br /> <br /> horror comes from seeing what Borchardt cannot do: this is the very American attitude - I want to, therefore, I am corrected - it keeps him from seeing how much he has to learn about his selected crafts. He is so confident that he cannot fail that mistakes are guaranteed.
