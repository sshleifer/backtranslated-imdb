I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are astonishingly clich√©d (like most vests in this era), his easy delivery and style really elevates the movies to classical and almost classical status. While this film is yet another example of real life, Western heroes are being exploited after their death by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the movie works well because of him as well as excellent supporters. One is the always strong act of Robert Ryan - an excellent actor who unfortunately is almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who has one of his best roles as the crusty and very colorful substitute. Here he is more fun than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mostly because his part is better written and he gets more to do. <br /> <br /> The reason is basically the plot of half the westerns have ever made. There are some villains who use a bunch of thugs to run roughly over the locals, and it's up to a do-gooder (Scott) to restore peace and kill the bad guys. But how the plot is performed is much better than average, and therefore the film is still visible fun. Just don't expect a lot of innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what might just be Gabby Hayes best performance.
