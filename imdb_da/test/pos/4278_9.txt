I have to admit that I have a special love for humor and history's narrative style in British movies, although of course it doesn't succeed. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think and finally left me with a quiet smile on my face. Its about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. Some very nicely discreet performances from all participants, especially the two leaders, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> It was very busy about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel Fellowes actually produced a better movie, although it has not been a mainstream release. <br /> <br /> An intelligent mature story of real people who are inconceivably flawless, but also capable of acts of true graciousness.
