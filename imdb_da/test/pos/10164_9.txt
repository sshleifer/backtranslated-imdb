I put this second version of "The Man Who Went Too Much" for my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Along with "Frenzy" it is probably the most argued movie among Hitchcock fans. I consider it far better than, "" Rebecca ", who has gained an unreasonable understanding. <br /> <br /> The movie features many brilliant scenes (most have been mentioned in other reviews), but it's something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used to prepare the following events that are full of exciting excitement. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the clumsy rear cuts, the only weakness in this movie is the greatest villain played by Bernard Miles, a rather flat and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as annoying as most children in old films.
