I saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago, and since then I have tried to find the origin of the strange emptiness I felt. When I watched this movie, I was afraid of the amazing snapshot of this community. Yes, it is absolutely true !!! I have also found a good job with a great salary, and I live with my Norwegian girlfriend in a lovely apartment in the center. But so far, everyone I've met has left me with the tasteless, empty feeling I had never had before - it's about this movie. Dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but numb comments, long silences, no stress, a creepy calm and frozen smile of niceness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly reproduced in The Bustling Man. Watch this movie !!!
