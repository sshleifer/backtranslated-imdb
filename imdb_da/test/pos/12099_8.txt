German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the endless variety of styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city uniquely located on both sides of the Bosphorus, in Europe and in Asia. Kurdish is represented by Aynur, who performs his own brand of Kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. We are introduced to Romany instrumentales, to Orhan Gencebay, who has been called Elvis of Arabic music - the sound of music is heard everywhere in the city as Faith Akin takes us into underground clubs, street performers and for recordings. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music quotes Confucius, "To understand the place, listen to the music it plays". Akin's fine documentary does just that - giving us 90 minutes of music that helps cross the bridges. For me, it was particularly interesting to watch the movie because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my vacation and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, liveliness and visual beauty. Now I can add the sound of the sound to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
