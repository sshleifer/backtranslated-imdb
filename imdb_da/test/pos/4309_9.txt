If you haven't seen this movie, do it. It's a genre mix that I've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious fun things, a movie noir felling, musical songs with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles mixed into a work of art. As a work of art, it must not be logical at the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I owned a TV copy on VHS, but lent it to an ex-girlfriend and now I can't get it back. But the film must be on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and be sure I will buy it.
