My boyfriend and I went to see The Guardian. At first I didn't want to see it, but I loved the movie - It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they are doing, And I think they should really be appreciated more. Not only learned it, but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what they really do and how hard the job is. I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around. I would suggest this movie to anyone to watch. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. Storyline was great, I give it 2 thumbs up. I cried it was very emotional, I would give it a 20 if I could!
