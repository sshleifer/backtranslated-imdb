I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. Cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; look for his mother who plays the protagonist, John John's grandmother. And you can hear her rap title song "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie as the credits roll. She is also very fun and a really good actress. The young actors who are in it (the main trio) and who are in fact part of the music group IMx, did a fantastic job. Before this movie, I had not paid much attention to this R&B group. Now I'm a fan. The music number in the House Party scene alone is worth checking out the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it.
