I'm not much for "cop" movies, but one is apparently a classic, and when I found it cheap I bought it and put it on a shelf, to just get to see it yesterday, and I LIKE IT! Now you can get New York City, but as a frame for a movie like this in the winter months, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police force group called The Seven Ups, who are 5 guys fighting crime undercover. In an opening scene, they regain a shoe box full of money from an antique store by distracting the villains with a "bull in a china shop" routine. But that's just the beginning. Seems that there are two guys who make up the police who kidnap mob types and hold them ransom. Richard Lynch happens to be one of those sleaze bags, and he's as creepy as ever. When one of the seven ups that make up a limo driver at a funeral, his cover gets blown, he is beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting billiards I have set. It's amazing how easy traffic in NYC is for chase scenes, but it's still pretty amazing when Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what I'm guessing is the Bronx and then on a turnpike and finally Scheider's car comes to a screaming stop in one of the most heart-stopping finals for a hunting scene that I have ever witnessed. Nevertheless, since the police end up dying, Scheider and his men are suspected, because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities, he wonders if they are kidnapping mobsters, so of course this kind of thinking must sip in the knob & Scheider is relentless to get to the bottom of things. All in all, a decent police / drama, not really my thing, but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10
