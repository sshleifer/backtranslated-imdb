This movie is the best kung fu movie all the time. Though there are no threadwork and special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this movie uses ingenuity and creative camera work to create memorable fighting moments, and the battle scenes are well choreographed and tight. There is plenty of action in this movie with lots of great fighting scenes, but the story is also very good with many twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have a real depth to them, as the motivation for their actions and personality is revealed much more than most kung fu movies. There is some really good camera work in the movie, with my favorite picture starting as a close-up on our hero's face, showing his reaction, and pulling back quickly to reveal the scene in front of him that is the cause of his appearance. Originally, I bought the movie to hope to see some fantastic fighting scenes, but on several shows I learned how amazing the play and the story were. Overall a great movie.
