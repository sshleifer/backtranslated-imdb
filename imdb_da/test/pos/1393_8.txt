I watched this movie on TV as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it for drive-in in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent a pre-trailer that was actually not the movie from the movie. It was alleged that footage of a naked woman was hunted around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at the drive-in's irate customers they did not complain about watching the movie they paid to watch. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off. So Corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive movie to the theater owners to split into the movie itself. Since the recordings were never part of the movie negative, it did not appear in any video, DVD or TV broadcast. Has anyone ever seen this recording? Anyone who saw this movie on a driveway in the summer of 1981 remembers this?
