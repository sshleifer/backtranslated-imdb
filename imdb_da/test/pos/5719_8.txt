I have never seen any of John Leguizamo's stand-up before looking at the Freak, and having seen it again on HBO's comedy, it was recently better, more alive and with things that I couldn't understand 14 years old before. Spike Lee did a wonderful job, keeping the visual angle level up with Leguizamo's theater and the style of personal storytelling; It is fabric and style that merge together but discreetly. We get Leguizamo's rants about race and sex (the sexes are classic), but much is about family, and which pegs are still fresh in my mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories, there is something new or crazy or coincidental that Leguizamo pulls out to laugh and it seems more often than not. If something falls (for me at least) it can be his personality print here and there. But in general it is the kind of fun material that is not boring, but is so true to itself that it sticks. Find it if you can!
