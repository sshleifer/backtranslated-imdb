Seriously, I really don't understand why people here base it. I mean, <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a killing white snow breaking out on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. The good news is, the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the army of darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little killing snowballs attacked, I laughed my ass out. For example, the set creeps one of the small into a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and mixes it. Then it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a loud pitch voice "It was fun!". Bottom line - incredible movie, rent it.
