I'm sure all Canadians on IMDb are too familiar with Canadian content and how much of it is ... Well, let's say, missing. There is a selection of few Canadian shows that are actually worth looking at, but this is certainly one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple prerequisite. Two guys take up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, adding in some witty and clever comments from a group of surprisingly sympathetic self-proclaimed "Alpha Males" and you even have a very entertaining programming. Each episode is solid. If "players" are underpairs, there are some unpleasant moments to be had and there is a little gentle fun on them. If the "players" are good, it leads to moments that you just have to get up and pat on, and some comic roses lavished on them. The prerequisite is a little unclear, I know, and as a guy who usually trusts the fact that I am elevated over the typical terrible reality TV, it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is fun and fun. <br /> <br /> One thing to point out is how The Comedy Network did a terrible job marketing this show. Long ago, I didn't even know the premise, and all I knew was somehow a shirtless guy who "loves cougars" involved. But after actually seeing the show, I was surprised at how surprisingly it looks like Canadian content (despite a rather lame opening credit line). So give it a try. I haven't yet found any in demographic audiences (18-30 year old men) who have actually seen the show (and not just the annoying advertisements) who haven't had it. <br /> <br /> Take it back for a third season, Comedy Network. In fact, it has a good premise, unlike some other Canadian shows you've had (coughing * girls becoming girls * coughing). I usually reserve 10/10 reviews for "works of art", but I have as much fun watching this show, and I think it has been unfairly judged by many that I just had to.
