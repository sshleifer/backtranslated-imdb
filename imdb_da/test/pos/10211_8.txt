I doubt if the real story of the development of Western Union would ever have achieved a real audience. Instead of talking about building the telegraph system out west, it was the story of boards dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great "Robber Barons": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the fighting company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national rail system to rival Vanderbilt's. But it is not as exciting as the story of the telegraph line itself. At least that's how the audience would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he would probably also have agreed that rating. <br /> <br /> The film discusses how the telegraph system's location is threatened by Indians, spurred by a Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not satisfied with the development of a communication system that will surely shrink his ability to avoid the police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of laying the telegraph cables, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's associate Richard Blake (Robert Young) and a quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an Austrian with a little understanding of the West, is romancing Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. But he becomes a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to confront Slade. <br /> <br /> Slade was a true Western criminal, by the way, and the subject of part of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he had no interference in touching Indians against railways or telegraphs. But MacLane makes him a strange and utterly evil character. His killed by one of the protagonists is suddenly and from behind - and he sees the body as if he has just become free from an irritation. But Lang is responsible for it, as well as second hand. Look at the sequence of Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraphol that repairs it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets a little squirted. Then there is an Indian attack that we see from the ground. Eventually, Young is suddenly ripped back, but it is not brown but red that covers him. He looks up at the top of the pole and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie to watch and it's worth catching.
