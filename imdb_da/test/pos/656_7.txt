This is an interesting, hard-to-find movie from the early 70's with Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the clip like a sea. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent for packing. Vincent stops at a bar and enters a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a trip in the Pacific as a hard core Marine 'Raider'. Geres character is already posted and considering desertion, and he utilizes Vincent's innocence, steals his "baby blue" uniform after getting him full and pounding him in a spawn. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion hitch walks its way into Wyoming and stops at a small Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local cafe he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Living with Hudkin's parents, Marion attracts all the attention of the city's people. Sir. Hudkins suspected Marion and wondered how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up to the Japanese intern camps, as the city's people go 'hunting' 3 flush. Marion has been accidentally shot during this hunt. But there is still a happy end that confused me a little. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the top of his 70's performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid 70's were incredibly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heartbeat at the same time !!! He made a lot of quality films during his career and continued to do so in the mid-80s with the big TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Hedge', keeping the way people treat him (in his uniform) while traveling across the country. He must also have done some of the stunt work - there is a terrific river scene at the end of the movie - and it seems he is the guy throwing down the river to me! But much of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with JMV's talent and appearance. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil explored in "Buster and Billie" is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is lovely as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are beautiful - must have been filmed in Canada.
