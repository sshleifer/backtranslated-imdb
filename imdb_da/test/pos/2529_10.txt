Film about government failure and the selfish of adults. Overwhelming impossibility to handle life and the means the children go to in order to try to gain a living. Only live. Staying in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to see it because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. Seeing a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we do not have when it is so trivial to another. The children of the film are desensitized. They are more than desensitized by what is around them. They see sex as an act as if they are watching a television program. When one boy is with the hooker, Pixote sits on the bed and looks with a soft stare, no feeling. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the hooker also doesn't have compassion and pushes him away. A "human" movie with "human" relationships and moral judgment in a nasty, frightened, cruel world. Reminds us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
