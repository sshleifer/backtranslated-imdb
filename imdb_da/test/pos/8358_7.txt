Aslan Adam or Lionman, as it is more known among English-speaking audiences, starts with an epic battle when King Solomon and his army defeat a lot of guys, although I'm not sure who they were and the movie itself is not for help determine the fact. In any case, after King Solomon slaughtered all these guys, Princess Mary, Bishop Osorio & Commander Antoine is forced to sign a treaty that lets King Solomon rule almost everything in sight. Shortly afterwards, Princess Maria Solomon & they have sex, meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever (only two sentences long) Antoine waits for Princess Maria and plans to rebel against Solomon and get some sweet revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Salomon, even though his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, escapes with his patron Rostin with Antoine's guards in pursuit, after the shortest work ever (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes to run around a bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a young baby boy hidden in some bushes away from Antoine's guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to pick up the little trap, he finds that the child has been adopted by Lion's pride as one of their own! Years later and the evil Antoine now expects to treat his subjects without mercy, Princess Maria has born and he has a son, but Rostin also still jumps around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine. The task seems hopeless unless they can get help from the legendary Lionman who is more expensive than man ... This Turkish Greek co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan and is one of a kind movie, I found it hilariously bad but at the same time very entertaining. The script never seems to take itself seriously, it's a pretty funny movie sometimes, it moves like a rocket and is never boring or boring. Part of the English duplicated dialogue is just hilarious in connection with what is happening on the screen. None of it has any meaning, we get a boy raised by Lion's, an evil king, fraud, dark family secrets, birthmarks that form the Lions form in an element of the story that was present before the child was raised by Lions battle scenes. torture scenes where the posts people must be tied to wobble, old castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires and gymnastic rings, idiotic bad guys, all of which seem to have extensive facial hair and a central person who has a jaw line similar to a brick , can be stacked twice, hands are covered with acid (this acid can eat it through steel door, but kept in a ceramic jar!) and fall over 20 feet on a concrete floor and yet need no serious damage! Aslan Adam is a great entertaining movie, I don't think I've seen another movie that looks like I can compare it too, if you're looking for something serious then forget it, but if you like 'so bad' is -good 'type of movie and wants to have fun, laugh and be entertained, then Aslan Adam must be at the top of your list. A total of 100% gold for poor movie fans and those with a taste for the different and bizarre. On the disappointing side, Lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end, which is a shame. The manager Bayten certainly keeps things going at a fast pace, even though it is far from well done during the opening battle for a moment the guys are fighting on a sand dune next to them on a grassy hill with trees in the background! There is a point where the Lionman uses a "branch" for pole vault, but of course it's just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it! Then there is the scene when a bloodthirsty blood cushion is supposed to chase the Lionman down, but the dogs used are of course different breeds, including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever! There are just as many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just funny, stupid, bizarre or all three that I could continue forever. Just check that end when the Lionman jumps and flies anywhere he can fly. There is plenty of blood in Aslan Adam, although not much actually graphic or violence, a few stabbings and someone has their hands cut off, is as graphic as it gets. Technically, Aslan Adam is pretty ropey, period costumes are bright and garish with purples, yellow, red and various other bright colors. The battle scenes are cheap, but at least the filmmakers sought to put as much effort into as they could. The music seemed to be more suited to a classical ballet than an action movie and is yet another bizarre aspect to Aslan Adam. The action was poor, although you could tell the play was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish, so many things to suffer, laugh and enjoy in this movie that I just really liked it. In no way can Aslan Adam be considered a good movie in any form of the word, but it is a hell of an entertaining. I might have to see this again sometime soon just to prove to myself that I didn't dream it all! The best Turkish action movie about a man raised by Lion's, you will ever see, period. Proven popular enough to spawn a successor, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
