This movie offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sang a duet from "Don Giovanni" beautifully describing their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent movie. The story unfolds in Jutland from the 18th century, and the use of period music played on period tools is only a more fine touch. You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his participation of Cailles and Sarcophage, even if you just watch a movie - but you only want a little try to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share his creations directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, the potential for food sharing to change how people see each other and how they see it, is pretty much the same as the "Chololat" theme, but "Babette's Feast" hits you not over head with his message. The cities are conservative puritans, but not excessively oppressive. You will understand and respect them and ultimately appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many questions have been raised for you to reflect on: the nature of art, the consideration of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the impact of the environment on behavior, the life of life life to give life, among other things. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment to me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered on the climate of the meal. I expected deep in-depth observations, but I got some vague mysterious ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> But this undervalued movie leaves a lasting impression. The heat it generates is in contrast to its tight background. You will leave the theater that wants to go out dancing under the stars.
