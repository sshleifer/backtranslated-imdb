As an American fan of The Gentleman League, I had to wait months to finally watch this movie as it came out on DVD, but it was worth the (scary) wait. "Apocalypse" is amazing-fun, freaky, clever as hell, full of fun and cryptic references to the television series; pretty much everything you would expect from the gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The reason has already been discussed in other reviews, so I won't bother it again, though I will say when I first read it, I was a little hesitant. Obviously, these unitary characters entering the real world to confront their decision makers have been used before, especially in Wes Craven's undervalued "New Nightmare" and Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books (where King himself was a sign). The gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, and even adding a new element: another fictional world ("those days"). Soon all three realities are won together and the result is exciting: Geoff Tipps is knighted in the Middle Ages (and tries to judge Queen Victoria Wood); The Real League of Gentlemen in Royston Vasey confronted with characters such as Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner convenes a homunculus outside Bernice Church. I have heard that some people did not like the "King's Evil" subject, but I found it funny, especially Reece's character (which seemed to channel Judith "Witch" from series three). <br /> <br /> When I talked about the characters, I was relieved to find it, though Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp were planted in the core of the movie, other more well-known characters were blamed. Bernice's confessional in the beginning was fun and sounded back to the faster outline-oriented feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross though weird), though I would have loved to have seen more of Ms. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou stands for, like Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their lean screen time an almost magical feel (and just what the HELLEN has Papa hacked up as an obscene hairball? According to the DVD comment, a "fat of oily pubic hair"). <Br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, but what's new? The music, as always, is breathtaking. I was thrilled to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of the theme music and his little repetition of the majestic, delightful piece that closes both "Apocalypse" and the last episode of series three. <br /> <br /> I have some minor complaints - it would have been nice to see more of the old, well-known Royston Vasey, and I felt that the stop-motion creatures (beautiful, by the way) were a little underused. However, both of these problems can be justified by the film's budget, so they are understandable. Still, I would have had fun watching the final battle in the main street (gentleman's original vision, according to the comments). All in all, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you are a fan of the series. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 10/10.
