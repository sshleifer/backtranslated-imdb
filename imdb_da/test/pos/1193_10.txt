This is a cult movie for many reasons. First, because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in Broadway and London, such as a musical film. The film is close to the game and some of the provocation of the game is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how young people in these late 60s managed to bring down the political establishment. Milos Forman plays with some situations in the late 70s as the narrow minded justice, the rich or the small self-centered navigability that has only a power position more than the powerless. He also plays heavily with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he is constantly building. The film stays comfortable and thoughtful. And of course it is a huge excitement to remember these years when we have had the privilege and it was not a chance to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered the mass-event for the 1918 ceasefire, which ordered all-level teachers to celebrate and march their students, thereby supporting the full-scale invasion of Cambodia. And some dare to teach democracy to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign of accusation of Nixon in 1973-1974, which will ultimately lead to his resignation and swear in Gerald Ford, the first Vice President and finally President of the United States, who had not been elected when he was appointed to the Vice-President of the Senate, after Spiro Agnew had to step back to face, conviction, and judgment for the assault. Of course, we get to think today when an American president in 2000 was not elected by the people, but by the Supreme Court or by a war rejected by millions worldwide from the start and just before the start and became initiated against the UN's better decision and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some talk about a new world order based on respect for others. The modern western man seems to have some difficulty in understanding that the world is changing and has already changed widely and wisely. The modern Western man seems to be without synchronization and needs special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is far from the majority and that if the Soviet bloc had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism, but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist, but the Berlin wall would have fallen, but vice versa, and that China has learned this lesson wonderfully well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy must lead to political democracy, but, like Vietnam, they can reconstruct after thirty years of vicious aggression and harm. In other words, Hair is a perfect food for thought.
