A man is wrongly accused of killing his friend in an aircraft fire and has to travel land to avoid the police and discover the true malignant nature of the situation at hand. A plot line, which was later used for fuel by Hitchcock's classic North at Northwest, has the Saboteur benefits of some very good performances as well as some masterful excitement from the Master. <br /> <br /> For every Hitchcock fan, the plot is a little familiar, but he was always able to fill the story with his own memorable supporting characters and charades. Here is the quirky and charming Robert Cummings leader and soon finds himself in possession of many strange and ornate characters who do not resist a troop of circus artists, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind lonely who shows him the best way to judge anyone on. . <br /> <br /> In terms of pure originality and quality, this lacks in some areas, especially the motives of the antagonists. There is, however, a good chemistry between Cummings and his leading lady, the highly underrated Priscilla Lane as well as a truly fluid performance as the blind man of Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would use later in the north at the northwest, only this time is the climax at the top of a New York statue. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some good moments to wait for.
