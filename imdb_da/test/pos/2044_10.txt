I love this movie ...! I've seen it 1000x on DVD and I can't say enough about it. It has everything, comedy, fantastic action and incredible stunts / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the show here quite a while. I do not think there is a moment that he is in that he is not fun! "Everyone knows that when you take an assumption, you make an ass out of you and umption" !! F / x is amazing! The bridge / truck explosion is incredible, although the sound is not so great! When Samuel leaves the truck, the sound is off a little and I say it's invaluable !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, put the sound in French !!! It's halarious !!! Even emotional moments are good when the bad guy discovers that Sam's / Charlie's daughter is his, great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do without ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Except for all the negative advertising, it kicks !!!!
