I was reticent to see this flick before I read the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? Firstly, because Mick Mallow's humor can (in my humble opinion) be rather crass and over the top, evident from his morbid shadow of a television show some years back. And secondly, because good Aussie comedy film is unfortunately as rare as Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Sensibly, Mick has maintained his natural comic charisma in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought that a bowling club would provide the framework for one of the funniest Australian movies this year. Cast is excellent with well-known local old timers that all put in credible performances. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see John Clarke play the villain in this piece. It's a one-dimensional part, but JC still adds a touch of class as always. Good to see Judith Lucy also getting a Guernsey or should I see bowls uniformly on the big screen. She is a true talent, compassionate that a number of his retorts were explosives. Her own material is very wittier. Interesting character though. Bowl reporter on a local cloth. How low on the journalist's food chain can you get! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. Many other people, of course, agree with me as it is about to be the biggest Australian movie this year. Good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to drag the hammer, laughing like so many Australian "comedies" before it. <br /> <br /> Finally, a little trivia. If you wonder what Aussie Rules team Mick supports, you should see flags on his workstation. Also look out for his old partner in crime, Tony Martin makes the announcement in the final bowls scene. <br /> <br /> <br />
