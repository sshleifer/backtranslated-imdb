The thirty years since this movie has made the excitement fade away and will not keep the public aware of what I am sure it did in 1979. However, it is still entertaining enough - and regains some of that power when finds out his sad relevance today (see the story of FirstEnergy's nuclear power plant Davis-Besse). With the top of the line actors and the steady pace, one can learn to overlook the dated 70's environment and see it for political criticism that it is. However, I doubt it will survive the test of time. It may not be completely forgotten thanks to its cast, but otherwise the dialogue, setting and score will make a remake of this movie inevitable. As the oil situation is now comparable to the situation in the 1970s, and alternative energy sources again become a warmer topic, we can only hope that the current generation will get scant warnings about the risk of (privatized) nuclear power like this.
