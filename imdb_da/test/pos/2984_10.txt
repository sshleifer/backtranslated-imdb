Well ..... I would not like to lecture anyone, but I want to say some things that I consider important to this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then once a year later. Thats it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack that made the music and story deeper and deeper in my heart. How deep? A week ago, my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a gift. (No DVDs yet). Boy .... I was surprised !! Poets have always maintained the deep childhood and youth experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic pursuits, remain with you forever. As they occur most at heart level (no intellect yet!), They define the contours of your souls as a sculptor would do with a stone. If sometimes we do not tend to forget how they are right, we would do better to understand the meaning of every minute, of every decision, of every turning point in our lives. <br /> <br /> So I confess I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is to watch the movie again, and through this turn back in time, enriching the understanding of why we, the 60s, grew up as we did. The spirit of these times is here: A Genesis created far from the official world of consumption and economic success, love not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of the lyrics, a completely romantic notion of youth rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tenderness and caste Love, these two lonely spirits that are still full of childhood innocence grow together as they learn mutual engagement and become "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the movie to a group of school children and they were redundant by such simple and cynical comments about it as naive and foolish. Guys, be serious !! Cinema is an art, and as art it not only reflects human emotions, but historical moments. And that's exactly what "Friends" does in a masterful way. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and new beginnings we all dreamed of when we were 15. I am now a musician and I still feel some of us, artists for that matter, still dream about it !! How else could we live? It's "Friends", it's "Brother Sun Sister Moon", it's "Hair". It was the times that were still alien to AIDS, foreign explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, pornography presented as "sexuality", to this barbaric new "world order" that grows after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What heart warming is experienced to see Paul and Michelle again, disturbing and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip back to the very heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at its best, to the urban scenario surrounded by 2 CVs of Citroën and the VW Mountains. What a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in the Camargue, surrounded by fish ponds and wild horses. They did us who we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the early Bee Gees, Belafonte's Spirituals, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvision. <br /> <br /> People still hope: get this picture. Start with innocence and grow from there. You find out what it's all about. And from there you have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideals to pursue in life, a way to deal with personal and international affairs. We need so much of this today! Give yourself the chance and maybe once the cynics will end. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogotá, Colombia.
