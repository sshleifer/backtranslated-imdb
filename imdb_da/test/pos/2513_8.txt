This is an unusual movie because even though it was made by Twentieth Century Fox because it is one of the few interconnections of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had made films for many different studies (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) around the time she did this, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this movie because he was loaned to Fox - some studios occasionally did in this era. The film is interesting because many real people have roles in the film, although the play is otherwise pure fiction. You will see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't remember any movie with McKinley or Dewey in it as a sign, though I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a few other movies. Three bowls to see a "smaller president" in a movie as a great character! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with McKinley taking aside a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) and asking him to be a special agent for him - and not telling anyone - not even the secret service. This is because the president fears that a person in the agency is overthrowing a gang that has made a large number of robberies - all based on internal knowledge. So it is up to Taylor (who is not known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to form a dew and find the responsible and inner man. <br /> <br /> But there are two serious complications. First, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is Stanwyck. Taylor finds himself in love with her, but he also has to do his duty and turn them over to the authorities. Second, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, develops serious problems when McKinley is murdered, and Taylor is at the scene of the crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film did a great job of making a story and placing it in a historical context. While today most people cannot remember McKinley or remember that he was murdered, the film is set in this interesting time period. The story is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, though I have to admit that Donlevy's role was pretty pretty and common to many of his other movie roles. All in all, it is very interesting, well-written and not so juicy in the romance department. A good excursion for everyone.
