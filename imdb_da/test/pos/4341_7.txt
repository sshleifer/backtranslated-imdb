LAUGH OUT LOUD. <br /> <br /> The only thing I start my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a child; and even then I felt the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible plays and lame script were ever clear since then. I saw it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad, it's actually good lol. As another reviewer said, it does not take seriously. There is no way to look at this movie and say that the creators did it. The soundtrack is so much fun, I laugh every time I hear it. 'The Climax is just a ridiculous uprising. It's an all-out war zone in New York, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it. <br /> <br /> Other exciting moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the policeman running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole Western West was so cheesy, it was fun. <br /> <br /> - It killed me how the bad guys could shoot at Kersey, and he could even fall on a knee that always took such cautious (and slow) goals and didn't hit the LMAO. Of course it was a shot with him. He killed with his elephant gun LOL. <br /> <br /> - Another fun scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang .... with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the whole side of the apartment with it. <br /> <br /> - It is clear that Kersey is all but used to losing his loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after just a few dates. The action is so bad that you can't blame anyone who could only believe that Kersey is angry at the destruction of the car lol .... he runs down, looks at the carnage and just goes away. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, that's good. <br /> <br /> *** out of **** stars.
