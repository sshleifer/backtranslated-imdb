People seem to wait for Citizen Kane here! Planet is a B-monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed. The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure of some of the casts. As for the effects? Â£ 8000 is not a lot of effects budget. I'd like to recommend this excursion to a sci-fi head or someone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously. If so, then? See 3colours blue instead.I noticed a review saying it had ripped alien. Like Alien, things didn't scratch away. The best part about the movie? Director. The worst thing about the movie? Cast. Maybe it's time for the director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. Meanwhile - well done. At least you try to do something.
