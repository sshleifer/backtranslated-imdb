How important is the instructor anyway? In this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s, where social organization issues were primary conflicts, the question posed by making a film turning the camera away from action and asking only to reveal director William Greaves. It is an important work, as it shows that no other movie shows the difficulty of blocking, organizing and setting the scene; it reveals the role of the crew, which most directors would completely disappear completely and that invisibility is essential to suspend disbelief; and it also takes into account the role of the performance and scripting and how they match / does not match reality and what has to say about how the director ultimately affects reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> Documentary or pseudo-documentary or fictional narrative (whichever you prefer via your interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the over-educated, over-intellectual crew member, its mother tongue in the lost artists struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions, and its heart in the director, who desires to portray, to represent, to express without any idea how to do any of these things or why he will do so. It is a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It's a movie that sometimes shows several shots simultaneously to leave editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective. It is an important work and something that anyone interested in the industry and the filmmaking process should see and understand. That, like many experimental films, has no real mass audience appeal - it's not for them. It is for the industry, and it is in the 60s that asks what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single voice and author. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
