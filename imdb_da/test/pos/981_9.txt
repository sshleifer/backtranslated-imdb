"Big Fat Liar" comes as a welcome - superficial, but welcome - fresh air after too many movies with bathrooms, body fluids, pets on acid, gaseous jokes and crotch bulbs. After all, "Watch Spot Run", "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" had signed The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. It is worse to acknowledge that the young audience would later be satiated by the smutties of the "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers." Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who randomly co-starred in the 80's sitcom "Head of the Class"), movie stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with a good lie to get out of the scraper. (Where is the English paper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: Change the paper at the end of the day or take the summer school. Jason whips out a story called "Big Fat Liar" and is hit along the way in school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and Dad tells him he has lost his trust. Months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie example of "Big Fat Liar" and go out to Los Angeles to destroy Ulve's life - all to get a statement that he stole Jason's paper to make the movie. They even get sympathy with some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former driver (Donald Faison), movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, playing himself) and the stunt coordinator (age of Lee Majors). <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" is without edge as his sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle" is known for, Muniz is easy to fight for but doesn't have much to work with. Also for Bynes, who overwrites his own Tracey Ullman-like sketch show at Nickelodeon. All hamminess is given to Giamatti, whose eyes bulge and cheeks angles with any insidious insult. <br /> <br /> The movie gets snaps just by trying the highway and should be enjoyed by the target audience (especially since most of the high jinks appear on the Universal Studios party). But here's a main scraper: The message is that it pays to tell the truth. But didn't we just see Jason come to his payback by telling white lies throughout the movie? Well, at least there is no poop.
