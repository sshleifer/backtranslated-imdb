"East Side Story" is a documentary for musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the Eastern European satellite comedies with many clips from the films and comments from the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look scary bad (The Bright Road (?) Is a remarkable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My wife wants to sing," "The white mouse" and "Midnight Revue" look particularly entertaining. The producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to confusion, humorous in retrospect, as the people whom the censors tried to appease were the very people who supported making the films Begin with! Since musical comedies were rather rare behind the Iron Curtain - there was only something like forty made in forty years - they had a disproportionate effect on their audience, who made huge hits of some of the films. <br /> <br /> I notice that the sixties movies were much better. The managers often had to deal with outdated equipment and strict power rules - they had to take movies in seven minutes or less - and dangerous officicrats. <br /> <br /> I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong impact on "Hot Summer". The later movies must not measure up to "Singin 'in the rain", but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "Bye Bye Birdy"
