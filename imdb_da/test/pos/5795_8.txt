A greedy presentation of the decay of family values ​​and human dignity in the wake of Soviet communism, the 1988 film Vasili Pichul's Little Vera is a milestone film of modern Russian cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitized idealism promoted in Soviet times (as in Alexandria's circus), which brashly moves the social chaos of his time into the public. A modern Ukrainian approach further intensifies the impact, first on the film's immediacy to its time period, secondly on the exploitation of a site that not only fights for identity rather than a Soviet system, but also as a nation different from the Russian idiom that dominated the Soviet Union <br /> <br /> Vera, the film's title character and protagonist, is a rebellious young girl with a "dysfunctional" family, including a hard-hitting father and a nursing mother. Rejecting her would be Beau Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and primarily sexual) relationship with a college student named Sergei. Despite her parents' dislike of the lazy Sergei, and despite Sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moves in their cramped apartment. Tensions escalate until Vera's father kills Sergei Sergey. Vera will decide if she wants to be loyal to her unacceptable family by proving her father has acted in self-defense or continues to support and defend the perpetual Sergei. <br /> <br /> In almost every imaginable way, Little Vera captures and communicates the inevitable void left in social life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggression in the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) coupled with the irreconcilable presentation of social reality (a marked difference from the socialist realism demanded by Stalin) effectively confronted the conditions of the former Soviet life. Most interesting, however, was the public reception. While many wrote mail to the instructor and star, the movie was wildly popular. Here is the double edge of "movies as social criticism": if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. Because no easy solution gives itself, some viewers will hate the movie and filmmakers to "bring up" the problem. Many movies are going to think like something similar in this respect: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even popular movie, like the John Hughes Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those viewers for whom the prospect of nearly two hours of scary domestic conflict and social miasma is not too scary. The film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulty of watching the movie, some moments in it are deeply beautiful. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and actually act as an even more assertive reason for watching the movie.
