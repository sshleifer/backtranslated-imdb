I find it hard to believe that this could happen at all. We don't know if Justin and Richard were upset or had committed crimes in the past. The movie seems to mean that they were not in and out of trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and jostle with the police? How do they pick up every girl and just say you're the one? Richard also seems to stifle the woman with little or no effort, nor do the women seem to fight. Hmmm. This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said, let's move on. I found myself really hate these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with political tactical ammunition and see what their plastic fits then. As for Cassie, who was the victim of Carl Hudson, having a terrible time trying to survive. The memory of having been piled 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does a fantastic job. She made sure she was an angry cop, as for the solution of the crime, I thought it was great. This movie kept me planted in my chair. Loved the action of everyone except Sam. He had no get-up and go. The only thing this movie did not need was the love scene, or should I say the rape scene.
