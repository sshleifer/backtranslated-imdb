In an early stage, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) walk down a neighborhood street in Chicago and admire the architectural architecture when a woman who terribly argues in French on a mobile phone passes them and urges James to comment: "There is nothing hotter than an angry French woman." A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, and also argue on a cell phone, and Luca notes that it is a referring effect: "There is nothing hotter than an angry, older Filipino woman." <br /> <br /> The mood of Jeff Garlin is that I want someone to eat cheese, best characterized by the word quotidian. The movie is a conversation. We can just as well listen. Instead of going to fakes, the movie depends on character errors and human curiosity to deliver laughs. Although it is not innovative, it is far from banal, and although James considers himself to be quite jejune, we know he is quite average, and he does. <br /> <br /> Self-service is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is excellent as a catalyst for change; She revives James and reminds him to live a better life. Yet the achievement of an idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but something simpler: they might pick up which pieces are of the life they love just to keep themselves at least enough to continue. <Br /> <br /> A film about life education can be surpassed as it may forget to connect with its audience. I want someone to eat cheese Med is subtle and immense, and while its morals cannot be inspiring, it is still resonant. This is low-key comedy, but it will stick to you.
