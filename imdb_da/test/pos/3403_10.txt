I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. Saying it is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I saw it in a year with our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They had lost it from TV. Our parents were happy that it kept us obsessed for one night, but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We were fascinated. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a valued annual tradition. We loved everything about it: the time, the romance, the battle scenes, the villain, etc. Come on, who can resist hating the psychic Bent with his constant SIR! Classic! In addition, who can resist to cheer wildly when Justin falls out of the balcony? What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can make me tear up a bit. This movie is incredibly moving, and I challenge anyone to stick to it all at the end. It is worth it!!
