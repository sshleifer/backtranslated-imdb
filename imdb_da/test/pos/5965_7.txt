Many animation buffers consider Wladyslaw Starewicz the great forgotten genius of a special branch, doll animation, which he invented almost singularly. . . And as it happened, almost by accident. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to film two catechist struggles led to an unexpected breakthrough in film making when he realized that he could simulate motion by manipulating carcasses and photographing a frame at a time. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz 'incredibly elaborate classic maps THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation of all kinds was in his childhood. <br /> <br /> The political turmoil of the Russian Revolution made Starewicz move to Paris, where one of his first productions - by chance? - was a dark political satire known as "Frogland" or "the frogs who wanted a king". A thrill of black comedy can be found in almost all Starewicz movies, but here it is very dark and aimed at adults who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children who are likely to find the climatic disorder. (I am the Middle Ages and found it rather disturbing myself.) And in itself, prints of the movie intended for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips to help soften the sharp stitch of the final. <br /> <br /> Our story is set in a swamp, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve the case. They decide to ask Jupiter for a king. The crowds are impressively animated in this opening order - it couldn't have been easy to get so many frogs to look alive at the same time - while Jupiter, for its part, is depicted as a droll, white bearded guy in the clouds who looks as though he would prefer a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who considers them scary, the seeds decide that this is no improvement and requires another king. Annoyed, Jupiter sends them a stork. Pleased with this formidable new king who towers over them, the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor appears to give him the key to the Commonwealth, as news cameras record the event. To everyone's horror, the stork eats immediately the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage and swallows citizens randomly. A title card sounds dry: "News about the king's appetite spread throughout the kingdom." Once again the dreaded frogs are asking Jupiter for help, he loses his mood and showeres their society with lightning bolt. The moral of our story, delivered by a rude seed just before being eaten, is "let alone alone." <br /> <br /> Considering the time this amazing little movie was made and considering that it was made by a Russian emigrant at the height of the besieged country's civil war, it would be easy to see this as a parable of these events. Starewicz may or may not have had Russia's anxiety in mind when he made "Frogland", but whatever may be his choice of material, the film stands as a warning of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s or any country in any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It's a fascinating movie, even a charming one in its macabre way, but its message is no joke.
