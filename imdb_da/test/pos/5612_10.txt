Hal Hartley's entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and fortunately, one of the few available on DVD. At only 63 minutes of running time, my only suffocation would be with Hartley. I always leave more, but never as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the highlight for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him an excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes where a microphone is waiting for him as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil. I've read other comments on this movie and had to add mine because there's not enough praise to go around. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in something (Unlike Sex), and / or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, get it as soon as possible.
