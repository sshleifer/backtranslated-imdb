A refreshing black comedy with some of Australia's finest. Just as Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the fun side of London's gangsters, Two Hands shakes through Sydney's underworld. It wouldn't be so fun if it wasn't so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could pull more rabbits like this out of the hat, it could actually have a movie industry worth watching.
