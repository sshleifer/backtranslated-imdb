The mountainous forests, young happy campers, a warning from a park ranger and a lurking figure. The ingredients are there for a terrible pleasure, and director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does an appropriate job of achieving it. It's formally wooded, but most of the time the performance is at the top of the game, and the story (which is pretty basic in a trimmed sense) is effectively told in some realities. Perhaps a little more exhibit would not have gone away, but Lieberman's craft constitutes the material's deficiencies and typical details with increasing tensions, moody images, and a stifling atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very uminously hibernating score. Whenever the very scary flute was cued in, it painted a really unpleasant sensation that settled in with the beautiful backdrop. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King also do a striking job. There is plenty of style in abundance, even with the minimal amount and structure is slow grinding. At times, pacing can become a stop-and-go affair. It is not very intense, but there is still a transparency, even if some of the screen happens. The latter chase scenes and escalating fear are well done, as it is the darkness that comes to life with it. Burly killer / s and you get actor George Kennedy riding his white horse in a small but wonderful ride. There is a gentle bunch of performances; Deborah Benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest cast of credible supplies. The final climax is quite twisted, but the end is one of the types that leaves you thinking ?? "Is that all?" <br /> <br /> A well-etched backwoods slasher element that probably plays it a little too securely to really set it apart from the norm.
