For the first time, this movie was seen years ago with my daughter, who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top film, so we looked at under 11, so under 111 now i find that there is less than 1v, which i can't wait to get my fangs on, and there is also a fifth in the pipeline . if no one has seen the movies. These are the best of the best. I think it's a thousand Oscars. I could see these from morning to night. I would love to have a set of nails like he has, beware of girls. I love it as all the stories continue from movie to movie. These ant typical vampire films are better. I would love to live in the life that is excluded in the movies. It would make all my dreams come true
