This movie was announced as a comedy but was far more serious than trailers made it to be. Don't make me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but expected more laughs. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. Worth to see, but don't expect to be rolling on the floor. The movie left me wondering how it would be if Robin Williams's character was a real person driving to president. Will we choose a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. That kind of sharp honesty is something that is missing a lot today. This is a movie I want to add to my DVD library as soon as it comes out on DVD. The movie has a heart.
