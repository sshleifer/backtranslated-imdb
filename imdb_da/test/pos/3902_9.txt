Contributed by William H. Macy from, no doubt, Donald E. Westlak's best and hardest to find novel, "A Travesty". * Much * true to the story, the movie star Macy as a rude man who goes way too far over his head after trying to cover an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The movie's strength is in the intricate twist-after-twist storyline and in the play, especially by Macy, who routinely and pleasantly breaks through the fourth wall here and comes away with it every time. A good story with very dark humor, this probably involved me that I have seen it three times a week since it came out. Prepare to pay tribute to your critical faculties and broadcast a high, two-part "wheeeeee!"
