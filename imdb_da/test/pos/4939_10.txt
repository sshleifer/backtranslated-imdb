BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful movie! Writer / Director Shemi Zarhin has made a story unlike others and cast it along with such consistently fine actors that it remains a puzzle for me that this movie has not become an audience's favorite worldwide. It is intelligent, emotional, constructive and warm, entertaining, and in all categories it is a winner. Silomi (Oshri Cohen in a brilliantly underrated performance) is a 16-year-old boy who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as uncomfortable as a shadow and in a constant state of bad temperament by her husband cheated on her, and because she is stuck, she works two shifts to support her father-in-law in-laws (Ariek Elias, who, as Shlomi's grandfather, is a bright, funny, wise and loving old man who cares deeply about Shlomi); a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab) who regularly moves into the house because of constant spats with her husband who does not help her care for their infant's twin sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is high electric guitars, braggadocio about female conquests and his favorite son. Stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi prepares gourmet dishes for them, stores, cleans houses, runs errands, baths and cares for this grandfather and generally leads a life to submission to a family who sees him as a 'retard'.Shlomi longs for a girlfriend and fails practically his school due to his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and lack of concentration. Serendipitously, his mathematics teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) discovers his natural mathematical genius on a discarded test, and with the help of the principal (Yigal Nair), the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius (? With dyslexia?) And make sure he is trying a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother won't hear any of it, but between the struggles with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and confrontations with the teacher and principal, they finally conclude his test for school. Meanwhile, Shlomi finds a girl, his age Rona (Aya Koren) who has moved in the next door and gradually becomes the two intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when grandfather dies, Shlomi sets out on the journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way the family addresses this is the top of the movie and need not be revealed for the sake of losing the strength of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creatively lovely, and the final result is one of the exaltation of the human spirit. Recommended at all levels. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
