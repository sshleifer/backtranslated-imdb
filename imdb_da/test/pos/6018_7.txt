"Gypsy" may be the greatest musical ever written, so it's too bad that it's the movie version was such a disappointment. To compensate for this, we have this reproduction which, if not flawless, is an enjoyable and well-made adaptation of the music. The script is quite accurate, all songs are included, and the layout remains close to the original Jerome Robbins' division. Bette Midler is a talented choice for Rose, her song and personality Merman-esquire, and her acting beautiful. Peter Reigert is a fine Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straightforward, natural Louise. In fact, a live capture of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly could have been a better idea if only because "gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this movie is a fine translation of a great musical.
