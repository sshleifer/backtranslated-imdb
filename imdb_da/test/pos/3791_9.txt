Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I, called The Great War at that time, single-handedly, even capturing Kaiser, which the Allied armed forces could not do. It turns out too much to be a dream, something of a cop and the weakest part of this fascinating quiet map (almost a feature film in 46 minutes). There are inventive gags galore including Charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat limburger cheese sent from home and then using the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded burial pit beside a soldier, he continues to annoy; Charlie spoils herself as a tree - one of his best sketches ever - and Charlie pretends to beat his friend who has become a POW and hugs him when the enemy is out of sight. <br /> <br /> An amazing feature is how much Charlie, when he is behind enemy lines dressed as German, resembles Hitler over ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs rose to dominate German politics. Of course, Hitler patterned his look after Charlie's from this movie.
