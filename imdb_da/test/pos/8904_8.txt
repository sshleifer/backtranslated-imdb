... but I laughed. Much. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Astérix et les Vikings' at a public screening under the World Cup. The sound was miserable, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I still enjoyed myself immensely. The names of some of the characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... Everything is not very witty, but in good Astérix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that not everyone seemed to get. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was Astérix and Obélix voices, at least in the German version. The voters are very well known here, which was the only reason they were thrown, really. They do not fit the people completely. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, the better) and having a few laughs. 8 out of 10
