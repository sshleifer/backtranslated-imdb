Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short film director Leo McCarey with Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! Charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearance unbeknown-est to each other. They then meet at a party and are merged with each other. Now they cannot allow each other to find out that they are cheating. This is the prerequisite for this hectic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few cartoon cards leading to a thriving career long after the styles, is perfect as Charley's nose wife. Charley has a horrible case of buck teeth that are quickly shipped at the dentist. After a party has been ridden by the police for no other reason than to pursue raids, Charley and his wife are frantically trying to avoid each other at home to fear changes in appearance become known. Both have been photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity of the home culminates in Charley and tries to teach the non-good-nick who cheats with his wife a lesson. The non-good-nick is, of course, the new Charley that his wife will realize before Charley learns a faithfulness lesson. This is one of Charley Chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
