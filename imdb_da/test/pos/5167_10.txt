My wife and I watched this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again. It was so moving that I called it a tear pipe. The mystery that Billings was sent to report on is by no means a mystery. Angles !! It seems that he always turned around something that happened to him, all good, and I think that frightened George a little, as he didn't understand what he was getting into. It just shows that even The cold heart can change with the right attitude around. If only we all could treat each other the same, the world would be a better place. To date, we have searched the web for a copy of it, now I finally have connection to it as soon as I can find a copy to buy I address it.
