It's about as good as the wind had been. I love this movie, I could see it over and over again. Scarlett always gets what she wants, no matter what the cost. She tries really hard to forget about Rhett, but she just can't do it. She loves him so much. This is a story of true true love. It started in gone with the wind and ended in this movie. The only real way to finish this movie for true true love. Was to have Scarlett and Rhett together again at the end. And that's the way it ended up with them with their daughter. What more can you ask for. There is no better end to this great love story than this. What else can I say about this amazing movie.
