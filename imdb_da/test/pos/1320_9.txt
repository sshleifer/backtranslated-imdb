There are very few films that can tell such a complicated story on as many levels as Mishima: A life in four chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of narration is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the movie. This movie not only flashes back and forth with the greatest light, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.
