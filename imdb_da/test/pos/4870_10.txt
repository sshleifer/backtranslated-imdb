OK, in all Wile E. Coyote Road Runner cartoons, we know that WEC must create all sorts of RRs, but always limit itself in different ways. It certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I think it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to hurt someone, the more you get hurt; such as Daffy Duck always tries to undermine Bugs Bunny's integrity, but Bugs see it around. <br /> Overall, this is another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes I think that if we really wanted to ease the war war tensions, we could just have let the Soviet Union see the Looney Tunes cartoons; I'm sure they would have loved them. Another great one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" the middle name of Wile E. Coyote is Ethelbert.
