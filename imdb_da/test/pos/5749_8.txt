I just want to say that the movie was good and touching. The film explains you the real meaning of being rescued or born again and is very well set out. The action was quite good, but could do with some improvements. The story board is captivating, and since my church had youth service and we saw it, 8 people gave life to Christ. I just want to tell anyone reading this, give your life to Christ and repent of your sin. PLease visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com Thanks, Andrew <br /> <br /> The word of God is not void. So get saved and repent from your sin!
