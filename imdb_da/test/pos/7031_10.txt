This is a great movie, I've seen it since I was 6 years old with my big sister. It's the type of movie you can see over and over again, and still laughing, smiling and crying every time without being saddened by other movies. It is a movie that will live forever through generations of family. I love it :) When you rank from 1-10 in my case, I will judge it slightly 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about changing a girl (baby) and her first boy friend (Johnny) their relationship within the family, the changes in the baby's and Johnny's view of the world under their relationship. <br /> DIRTY DANCING will always live on as a timeless class. thank you, sorry for only the short comment.
