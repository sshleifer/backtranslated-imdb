From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked. I had gone into this movie and thought it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead, I found a very entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thoughtful action movie. The movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and more ..) as Fry is really a joy to watch on the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you die just to hear him speak again. <Br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is breath, contrast of blues, yellows and oranges because of the three different suns is amazing. Followed by the complete darkness of the nightfall. I would really recommend any lover of the foreign films or Radha Mitchell (that's why I went to see it) to check out this movie. I'm sure at the end you will look at the dark in a whole new way.
