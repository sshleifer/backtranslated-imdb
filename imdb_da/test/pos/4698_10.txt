As mentioned and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many good items and ingredients for its credit. In fact, more than 20 years after it was originally transferred, it is still seen and monitored again and has a great global fan-on, indicating that decision-makers in this series are undoubtedly right. <br /> <br /> However, the root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has been that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters ?? which are all brought to life by amazing actors. The characters are wonderful especially because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations and many other film and television productions in general, the good in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have errors, while the evils appear to be evil and ruthless, often understood and even with occasionally seems sympathetic. This makes much of Robin of Sherwood a story of multifaceted, real people ?? rather than good and bad people ?? something that adds a lot to its unique and remarkable appeal. Even though it is a lot of action-packed series of great stunts (which are remarkable in itself, as it was made long before today's computer animation, green screens, etc. So behind all the endless guys, castle walls, horses and fires are actually falling. A real person who at one point fell from a castle wall or a horse or burner), there is always a great dialogue between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis, however, is it generally the series villain ?? Nickolas Grace as Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne, and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Rainault ?? who gets the very best lines and who more than often steals the show with their arguments full of whites and slopes. "It's a wedding, not a party!" is just one of their many timeless "wisdom beads" that seem to follow one through life :-). 20 years after the fact, it is actually hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally made for television ?? and apparently not with a lot of money ?? to provide fleeting Saturday afternoon entertainment for young children in the UK. Filmed in beautiful places, with clever, amazing scripts and with remarkable stunts and amazing actors ?? many of which give the performance of their lives in this performance ?? This seems in many ways to be more professionally made and has more production value than many a Hollywood movie.
