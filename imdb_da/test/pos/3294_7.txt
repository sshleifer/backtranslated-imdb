Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems quite ironic to me, because it's actually one of the first movies I remember. My mother took me and my little brother to watch this movie at The Garland Theater in Spokane when it first appeared in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I'm here in memory, but I think this movement is about a staircase accused of a crime he didn't commit and the law goes after him. I think it's set in 1800's Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the stairs played by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a very good movie with a great setting. It can be compared to the 1981 movie Death Hunt with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar story line. The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult-oriented movie, while Challenge is a family-friendly movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this film was made, which I find quite impressive when you think this movie was filmed on the spot in Alaska's wild. This was the last movie made by Tay Garnett before he died, which was just a few years later. They both had existed since the silent era.
