This should be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaves everything behind to live in the desert. When mother and father both lose jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. They decide that it is in their families who are most interested in moving to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast character complements this film. Including a young Molly Ringwald, I would definitely recommend a movie.
