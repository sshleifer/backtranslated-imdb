In August Days / Dies d'agost, Marc Recha has given us a sun-drenched Catalan documentary film, which is mostly an enchanting, impromptu meditation on brotherhood and regaining the dead. The beautiful, sometimes large, rich atmospheric 35 mm. Landscape pictures, fine soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a piece of humor if you are satisfied with a path that does not have much speed and does not lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars, and the narrative is expressed by their younger sister. Marc had researched the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. He felt he was full of information and had to take a break. Pause turned into making this movie, which seeks to capture the mood of interviews with Barnil's cast, thoughts of the Spanish Civil War, the drought, they experienced, the harsh landscape, the Recha brothers' love for each other, swims and healthy nudity and whatever character or stories they ran into when they camped out of their van. This leads to the exercise of a huge catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. Eventually, David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter, and Marc must return to his project and end it. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narrative in Catalan language with its mix of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps associated with Provencal?). This is not a big movie, but it gives attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its pure visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and mixing autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way. <br /> <br /> An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center.
