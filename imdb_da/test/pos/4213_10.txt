I must have been about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to watch this martial arts movie on "DRIVE IN" at the Long Beach Circuit. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD" which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember is the various scenes that have left an imprint on my mind forever. My brother always reminds me of the movie, even though it has been forever, it seems since we watched the movie. From time to time the throwout years I would look for it at the rental shops and from time to time I would check online and for some reason it seems like it is never available or no one knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I only knew if and where it was available, I'd love to buy that movie. If anyone is aware of the availability, please inform me.
