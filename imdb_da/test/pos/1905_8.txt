Certainly this movie is not for everyone --- but for anyone with a humorous humor and love for period film √ê buy it immediately! Where else can you come down in 70's fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate train hookers, crime, a rap about Titanic's sinking, shoot outs and a co-star named Queen Bee (beware that she moves gray scene early in the world) office!) With a movie style that is a cross between a porn movie / Dawn of The Dead / and Car Wash, you can't go wrong. This is one to see again and again. Then the children put to bed.
