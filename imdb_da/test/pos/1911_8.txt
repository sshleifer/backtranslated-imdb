A blaxploitation classic, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for "toasts" that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toasts are long rhyming stories that are fun and deliver a point and you can see how they naturally evolve into rap. For more on toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> Which leaves us just talking about the movie itself. This movie packs into a lot of "laugh-to-fun-outfits-and-hairstyles" bang for the money, as almost every shot has some form of outrageous element or dialogue. It begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who hit him and bring him to court. I didn't realize that prisons are releasing people so they can prove their own innocence, but I am a neophyte in the prison scene. He is assisted in this by Queen Bee, the Dolemite's leading prostitute, and has run his brothel while he is away. She has also put all her prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it gave an interesting contrast. The first part I saw on my lunch break while exercising and not enjoying it much at all. It hit me as a particularly badly made blaxploitation, with a ridiculous story, capricious craftsmanship? Well, I think it makes it sound like it had some craftsmanship and lots of outrageous rooms, clothes and dialogue. But I don't enjoy it? In fact, it's got me dirty. Let's see it, a white guy sees something like this laughing at the clothes, and the things that the characters say are essentially getting a pleasure out of what is racist: how ridiculous the black people dress, what Stupid things they say. I was not really happy about it, did not laugh and did not look forward to seeing the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state", I looked at the rest ?? and legally loved it. Like Disco Godfather, which I had seen a few days earlier, this has a warmth and sweetness in the core that makes it comfortable even when it's stupid or violent. Dolemite's character has an element of self-pity about him who makes it all fun, and the look of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we see the group's efforts with a bunch of friends who just want to do something fun together. Even the bad doubling is fighting karate, and everything else makes it so much more charming. What I find interesting about the Dolemite movies is that they have some moral ambiguities I don't see in other blaxploitation films and certainly in very few mainstream movies. In this there is an African-American woman who speaks of the (white) mayor and says "he has done more for the black community than anyone." We later find out that the mayor is surprised, corrupt, but I like that movie will present this woman as essentially misunderstood and not try to "redeem" her in another way. There is also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp, which is presented as a useless junkie, and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming, socially positive angles to what he is, he is just. In Disco Godfather, the religious character Lady Reed plays presented as just nuts to want to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to angel dust. I like the movies to present such hard critical depictions of people in their own community without sugar coating or trying to redeem them to make them more tasty. <br /> <br /> There are many hootworthy elements, such as when Dolemite says "Move over and let me pass, or I'll pull those Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** a **." There is Queen Bee reaching over and answering the phone: "Dolemite's overall experience." And you won't miss (though you might want to cover your eyes) the expanded nude scene of REPULSIVE Mayor. I'm too mustachioed pervy older men, but even I have limits ?? - and my limits are usually a few miles past most people, so be warned. The DVD I had is clearly edited, which can be seen in some of the dialogue scenes, and ultimately, when the Dolemite's killing of a great character with its bare hands, of course, excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite movies as they are a hoot. I didn't want to see The Human Tornado, but after seeing the trailer, you better think I am. There is also a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I can't remember from the movie when Dolemite turns on a Mexican look, but of course misses and the guy flips into a nearby car strain. <br /> <br /> After seeing the first half, I would say skip this and see the Disco Godfather, as the film production and story is marginally improved, but after really enjoying the other half, I'd recommend seeing this over Disco Godfather, as this one is even more bubbly fun, outrageous and good-natured ?? and they have toasts which, although they do not understand the forms' roots and shades, are still something to see. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
