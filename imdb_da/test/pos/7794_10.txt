AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it a number of times (don't remember the counter now) and every time I just love it .... This is the best movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi .. Comedy, Dialogues and Performance are amazing. All actors and actresses have done a fantastic job ... You can't stop laughing while watching this movie ... it's just fun ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan have done a good job ... and Acting by Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ..... The music is inspired by the old Hindi movies (60s music) and is good ... the whole movie of the movie has done a good job ... <br /> All in all, it's a great Indian movie to watch ...
