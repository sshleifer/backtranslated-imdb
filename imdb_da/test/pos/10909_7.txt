I remember seeing this a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no details, so I'm glad I saw it again from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically, the new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won the Oscar award for his latest, playing a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank you" he even mentions his former school English teacher Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated Kevin Kline) and he outsiders him as gay! Howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media focus as a refusal gay man, especially as his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Joan Cusack) is on its way. So it comes for the wedding day, and when it comes to Howard who says yes or no, that's how he outsiders himself and admits himself and everyone that he's gay. Of course, this gets him fired as a teacher, but everyone is on the graduation day to come out (in support), and Cameron shows himself to clean up so everyone, especially school leader Tom Halliwell (Elves Bob Newhart) knows it's okay be gay. Also contributing to Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara such as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the movie should be when Kline cannot help dance to Diana Rosss's "I Will Survive" version, it must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprising Oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members also make their bit in this very fun comedy. Very good!
