Don't Torture a Duckling is an amazing giallo diversion to Lucio Fulci. Unlike other subgenre heavyweights such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci takes a particular gritty, grounded and socially perceptive approach to the giallo tale in this movie. There is nothing glamorous about child murders and border pidophilia (a 1972 gutsy subplot) going on here, and Fulci wisely changes with a stubborn and lucrative eye that avoids flash, melodrama and directorial histrionics. The case is characterized by gory and instantly tremendous sets of pieces, further strengthened by Fulci's huge sense of realism ?? The deeply disturbing "witch-like" scene with its bald facial brutality feels like a snus movie. Composer Riz Ortolani reserves these blood-filled scenes with bursting reverberations. <br /> <br /> The film is covered by a simultaneous lyrical and violent conclusion, in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition collide. It is a deeply effective ending that has the ability to leave the viewer in a humidified and disarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci couldn't have chosen a better location for this movie. Don't torture a duckling was photographed in and around the old town of Matera, Italy. As Matera continues to modernize to this day (highlighted by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one), it is struggling with its UNESCO-sponsored reputation as a container for mysterious paleolithic ghosts. The Real Life Concern Materani is reflected by the characters in the film who, with their Christianity on their sleeves, face any exotic tradition (namely, witchcraft) that goes beyond the norm. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Matera was also used as a stand-in for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's Christ Passion. If anything, this adds even more strength to Fulci's message. Catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonance combination.
