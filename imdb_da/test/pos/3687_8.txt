Minor Spoilers In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has 25 years of marriage with Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf sister-in-law, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace adores singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price) who will present a television show in Chicago and will give five spots in the first place in a TV commercial. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket when Max at the same time asks for divorce and claims that their lives are too monotonous. Grace gets depressed and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a Chicago serial killer using an armband killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England for Victor Fox's funeral. There she realizes he was gay and becomes friend of his former friend Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago and try to find the killer. This movie is a lovely, original and weird dramatic comedy with bizarre characters. It has great potential to be a cult movie, with Julie Andrew's and Barry Manilow's features and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece 'Do not Look Now' when Maudey wears a red raincoat in Chicago's underground part of town. The beginning of the movie, with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway', is wonderful. I have repeated it four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent achievement highlighting Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. In fact, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cupid and Toda Try' ('Love for the proof')
