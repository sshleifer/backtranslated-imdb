First of all, let me say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized I was totally uncoordinated. I've always thought it was cool on cats who know how to get extreme on them, do their thing, but I've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. That said, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers have said that these dudes were kind of raising their own flag a little, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys deserve as much credit as someone to shake the skateboarding world and have given some good pictures of their innovations to back it up. It's great how viewers are allowed to see these guys now and now, and the footage they shot while they were growing up in California, gives some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. . I would never have understood where extreme skates came from, but this film kind of ties all pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it is at least a bit biased, but aren't all documentaries? Worth looking at for anyone interested in the sport or as in my case anyone who grew up in the 1970s.
