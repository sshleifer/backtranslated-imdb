an amazingly made for the sci-fi channel film, which far exceeds many of the poor past efforts they have churned out. Bruce Campbell has a fantastic form as a potential investor caught in a bizarre experiment led by a scary professor, Stacey Keach, and his half-white help, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure b movie gold and it is great to see Keach and ram on the screen with Bruce, and the fact that much of the movie works exclusively on Bruce's comic slapstick play is what makes it fun and makes me ask the question , why does this guy not get more of his scripts on order? It is actually a sick world. Definitely worth a watch.
