I LOVED this movie. Not as big as "50 first dates" but it is definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even incredible, but what's so bad about a good movie. Drag as Josie and her romance with the teacher are so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds the movie's good feeling. With all the unwanted out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your children! Drew is a great actress who really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of her best roles!
