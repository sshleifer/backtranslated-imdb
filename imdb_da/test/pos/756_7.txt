You will either love or hate movies that this thriller puts into a lonely asylum in a far lonely country. It's not that much of a horror show, but a collection of scary images and wackozoid mental patients. "Scream" is the best expression to be used in what was apparently a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behavior. Note the "judge" who is putting on the ax behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r !!! Not much else can be described here than some bloody tasty goodness, but when you get a chance, remember the familiar old saying of hag lady: "Come out! Come out! And never come back!". Don't you want you not to look in the basement?
