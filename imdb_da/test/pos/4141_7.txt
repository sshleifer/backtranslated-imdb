I was 13 when Elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly stepped in to give the wife some competition. One of Buddy's great talents, in addition to his unique song style and his writing ability, is often dimmed. Buddy was also a talented leading guitarist who developed a unique rockabilly style all his own on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey is trying to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. There were other simultaneous guitar rockers of the same caliber as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As noted by others, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story." Not only does the script with facts about Buddy's life work, but it even interferes with more anachronism for the two years of Buddy's popularity, basically 1957-1959. One that comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria watch a 3-D movie. Buddy is dissatisfied with everything and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a dish. In fact, there were no 3-D films in circulation at that time. The high point of 3-D was in the early 1950s. In 1955 the father had already faded. Yet another example where just a small study would have been sufficient to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to separate what has really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story of how Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryptic, but it certainly has not taken place as it appears from the movie. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are depicted. It was decided that Buddy's parents supported their musical career. "Maybe Baby" is credited to Buddy's mother and she has recorded in the song's writing. It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but I miss hearing one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that Buddy's music was reissued to a new generation hearing as a result of this movie. His legacy is one of the very best of rock'n'roll's early days. Rave on, Buddy, rave on.
