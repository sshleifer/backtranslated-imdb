An obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who would not (when it was filmed) be the first sign you think of for such a role. And yes, the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, managed to seduce during this creation. I can only say that this movie should have been released as it is in the United States, rather than thinking of making a remake. It is simply so French, almost perverted .... and yet so true ... this movie should remain untouched ... An instructor who should definitely get more projects like this type of subject requires real amount of ingredients that don't do it to the flop ..
