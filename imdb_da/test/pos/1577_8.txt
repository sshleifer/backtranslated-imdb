If they awarded prizes for the most bad and broken movies in the world, Japanese cinema would clean up: their feature film dries the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme examples being absolute tricky exercises in bad taste, nausea gore, freakish weirdness and misogynistic sex . <br /> <br /> Guts of a Beauty is an excellent example of such an eradicated filth and offers dear viewers just over an hour of bloodlessness and free violence with some very insane J-splatter goodness. The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza who continue to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called Angel Rain. After gangsters finish having fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and fly to a nearby hospital, where sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) is trying to help. But the confused and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing herself out of the hospital and becomes a watermelon as she hits the ground (at least what it looked like!). <br /> <br /> Seeking to avenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi lures Higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office, and while he is jostling him, he hypnotizes to attack his fellow members. After Higashi goes slash happy with a knife in yakuza HQ, he is severely beaten and broken, forced to tell about his meeting with Hiromi, and then hacked in itty bitty pieces. <br /> <br /> So the psychologist gets trapped by the gang, is exposed to a sting of forced buggery (while being forced to give his head to a yakuza blunt) and injected with Angel Rain, and immediately she teases it . The gangsters then plonk her body in the luggage of their car along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. Before they can dig the bodies, super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a dental penis and a ravenous gash, and hell-bent on revenge indicates killing the yakuza one by one; this leads to some memorable scenes of spooky gory splatter, including a messy headache, a man being strangled by the monster's rising vagina, and a woman being killed by her giant gnashing phallus. <br /> <br /> As you can most likely say from the above synopsis, these are some crazy, twisted things and probably not to the taste of the most sane people, but to the strange people who have long tired of the mainstream The cinema and already well-versed in Asian profits, Guts of A Beauty must prove to be nice and distracting fun. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
