I just got it and it's a great movie !! I loved it! Although Jane Brighton's voice n is beginning so annoying because of her hangers, she doesn't open her freaking mouth ... but you have to see it because it's a good movie !! the things he says here are so fun and extremely sweet !! and I'm sure Aaron would say some of the things in real life because I don't know, it just works like that !! ha ha there is a role in tha movie that is really funny ... his wen jones little sister meets him ... but i can't tell you what happens because you just have to let yourself see! I went to see Aaron n concert and it was so much fun !! n he smelled so good ha ... i still can't believe i met him !!! I have pictures if anyone wants to see them !! Steph
