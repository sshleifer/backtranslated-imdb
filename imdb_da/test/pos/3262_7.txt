This Aussie flip filmed in 1999 makes an OK job of portraying a bunch of little corks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The ground focuses on the situation of a young arbitrary crime whose life is in danger after hitting a job for its future boss. Very well traded by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The reason is pretty credible with some very humorous moments in a scene that revolves around a bank hoist. The layout of various themes central to history is quite well done. Eg. When a crime searches for bullets for his gun. I personally have an aversion to free violence in movies, and in this respect the film has not insulted. It tried and managed to show us the human side of the evil ones like Bryan Brown. The rest of the throw did an OK job, with no real stand-outs that I remember. The direction was very good at succeeding in making a credible film that provided good entertainment. The main overall feature that makes this a good movie is Heath Ledger's play and direction and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-lived satisfaction, believes that he is indestructible and unaware that there is malicious people waiting to make a mistake. Director Gregor Jordan deserves special mention. Rating in my book - 7 (out of 10).
