I think anyone who's stupid enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to the football game or they don't want to leave their car "to be cut off" deserves what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The guy, Wade, who "went to the hair salon and asked for the hairdresser for He-Man" was not my type, but there is this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair grown. It's a little too high maintenance for me. <br /> <br /> Also fun, but not my type is the cool guy in the big sunglasses that looks like "Elton John only gayer", but the whole plot goes nowhere! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I could see myself with him if he wasn't in his girlfriend, who is a fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (no Chihuahaua in his handbag, but it would have been really precious). I don't think girls like it are going to football matches anyway. Nick the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a football lands off him, and instead of throwing it back, he throws his cigarette down and it burns the football. Look, it's just the kind of guy he's. He has a sister who looks stupid to borrow his white wife beater. Her bra straps refer to as 1/2 film! <br /> <br /> Mostly, you just want to grow your legs and not ever go to football matches after seeing this.
