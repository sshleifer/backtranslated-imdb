Style over fabric. But what a style it is. "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, history hardly supports the views. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) enters her patients' dreams through artificial means to discover and help them overcome their phobias and obsessions. A new patient who fell into a coma is informed by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims, so put their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane has to get into the killer's mind and navigate through her sick fantasies to find and save her last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion, from the landscape to the costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from a lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he is the last person you want to worry about. Without him, you have virtually a movie that only moves in the present, which is a shame as the film is so visually stunning and really scary. Lopez is wasted, but she's not that great an actress anyway, even though she's as beautiful as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he overcomes the start. He tried too hard to become his character, and it showed. Stick to comedy, Vince! Still, this movie is so visually scary, I still see this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep immediately afterwards.
