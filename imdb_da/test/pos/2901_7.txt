This was the second Cinemascope play that Fox produced after the robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are edited to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can see which composer has scored specific scenes). However, the main chair is a little weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited selection of emotions and is uninteresting to see. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress "Nefer". I find this movie generally to be strong on the plot, which is rarely for these big glasses produced at that time. All in all, the film makes an interesting and entertaining job with social comments about what Egyptian society might have looked like.
