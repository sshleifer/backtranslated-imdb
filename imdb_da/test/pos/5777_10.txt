This film broke lots of ground and generally receives much less credit than it is due to. It touches on a topic that is eternal in our daily lives, but is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not deserve discussion. This phenomenon is for caregivers (be it doctors or as in "Broken Promise", a senior social worker) who abuses their position to harm those they have been given to protect. <br /> <br /> In Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are surrendered by their parents; but will soon be picked up by local law enforcement. Unlike the safe prospect of nursing homes, Patty asks a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together. This social worker is approaching a senior member of another department, but his request is denied. <br /> <br /> The kids are parceled off to separate homes and follow today's past attitudes and ensure a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that gives the film that name, causing the dramatic excitement to continue throughout the movie. Attacked by the apparently treason of the young social worker, Patty Clawson runs away from the embryo she has been sent to. Faced with the frightening task of finding his family in a climate where the ideal is seen as a complete separation from the past; She does the only thing she can to determine their whereabouts and breaks into the Senior Social Workers office to steal the case file. <br /> <br /> Committed quickly after she finds that she has made a dangerous enemy. Furious by embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department, Senior Social Worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her; something he is legally entitled to do. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> Customers are relatively taboo. It has certainly been touched very little in movies, as few directors want to step on the road, which would mean caregivers cause damage. I think this movie plays a very important role in making the public more aware of this kind of thing. The depicted case is not only plausible, but has probably happened many times before to many other children around the world. This movie is critical for changing public opinion to get rid of the laws that protect harmful people like Senior Social Worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Broken Promise. It is particularly suitable for intern social worker, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other careers. It is a lesson in avoidance that should be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> As for the action in "Broken Promise." Melissa Michaelsen plays an amazing role as Patty Clawson. Especially in films such as this credibility is critical. If the viewer did not identify with Patty's character, the whole movie in the movie would be in danger. It is unfortunate that Melissa does not yet appear in films today, as her performance in "Broken Promise" shows her having had exceptional talent.
