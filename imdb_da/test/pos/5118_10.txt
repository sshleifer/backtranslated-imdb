If I had to decide which one was the best Ernest movie and didn't seem like the kind of thing that didn't happen all the time, it would be this. All Ernest movies are entertaining, but the best ones are those who have Jim Varney to make a variety of characters. In addition, I am known for enjoying comedy stylings by Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as the Chuck brothers and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Failure" contains all of these elements as well as a fun script and a supportive cast containing several beloved character actors. <br /> <br /> And so I have chosen "Ernest Goes to Failure" as the king of all Ernest movies. Disagree with me if you have to, but deep down you know I'm right.
