The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you are only sorry one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the non-good Harry, to no avail. <br /> <br /> There is satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a major role as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitels moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino makes half a monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man. Time and time again there are great moments in history, but in the end it is difficult to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but somehow it feels right. <br /> <br /> This movie is weird, but then I am too; no wonder i liked it.
