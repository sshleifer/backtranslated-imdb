Shia LaBeouf has impressed me before with her working ability, but I can honestly say that I am very much looking forward to his next effort ... his portrayal of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enter the 1913 US Open tournament in his hometown ... the beginning of the film pulls a bit, but it is necessary to create the underdog subplot that Shia works so well ... the whole throw is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, on the basis of the current event, has a conclusion that everyone can discover before they see the film ... but even because the information does not destroy the fun ... Josh Flitter is lovely like Eddie Lowery, Francis' caddy, who keeps him grounded and loose, while proving to be an invaluable part of Francis's effort. Stephen Delane is excellent as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer, whom Francis idolizes yet to fear. .. and who knows the background Francis comes from when he also had humble beginnings ... Bill Paxton takes a formal movie and makes it worthwhile ... bravo Mr. Paxton and bravo to throw ... from imagery to the story of the people who bring it alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy and refresh ... it's nice to have movies like this so we can feel ourselves good fit ...
