The reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has construction problems lack the point. This is a wonderful camp romance, with lots of play, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music that both sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Button-up Ray Milland makes a fun foil for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was out of the hall than her labeled vamp roller. Censorship is in force, it is clear that they only share a caravan on platonic terms, with Milland fighting for Dietrich's progress with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who can be killed some day. His only excuse is that she smells so maybe a slut and cunning Englishman can actually be dismissed. In the small role Milland's young companion on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note of a camp of a different kind. We are told at the outset that he heals adolescents Milland When, when separated, meets Milland, now turned into a brown skin gypsy with a shirt open to the waist, his glowing appreciation of disguise shows even more that not alone Dietrich is romantic in love with Milland. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful unlikely signs and events, the growing love of Milland to Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life are quite touching. And when in their last night alone before escaping, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, the two have become one, and then the darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break! A goof - in the beginning, Milland, who was supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant using the American pronunciation. (The English says "leftenant.") Since Milland was British, he must have said it that way because the American filmmakers feared that American audiences would be distracted and confused by the British style.
