In The Fire Line we give a good game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this rivet film. Malkovich says he wants to kill the president and he calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character. All he does, he does a reason, and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood must overcome his overall suspicions of catching Malkovich, but no one will listen to him. The result is a movie that breaks with excitement escalating to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson jumps up the thrill and we feel every turn.
