Cecil B. DeMille instructed a series of comedy dramas at the end of teens and early 20s. He found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in Gloria Swanson. Do not change your husband, Swanson plays a boring housewife whose rich businessman (Elliott Dexter) attaches more importance to work than to her. She is chased by a beautiful roue (Lew Cody) until she parents and divorces the boring man to the new lover. Things get confidential, and Swanson discovers the new man is as negligent as the first. To make matters worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman on the side (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and practical meetings, things are solved. <br /> <br /> This was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson a great star. Although she was only 20 when she filmed this, she is very good as the perhaps stupid wife. She looks good and has some beautiful dress. There is a memorable scene that is 100% DeMille, where Cody lures Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As he is with her, she depicts the scenes. Pleasure is a stunning scene of Swanson in a spidery hammock swinging over a pool while people dance around. Wealth is a scene where Swanson is dressed as a Babylonian queen as servants bring her jewel coffins, which shes cast aside. Love is a scene where she is a tree nymph that loves in a pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum but very entertaining, and Swanson looks good. Dexter is very good as the blind man who shaves his mustache and starts training to win his wife back. Cody is also good as the false charm that is a liar and cheat. Faye is fun as the bitchy other woman - no tad's name - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays wife Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis and together were the pioneering and influential modern dancers (by Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Every time I see her, Swanson impresses me. She seems to have been such a natural actress, and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just fascinating. She is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movies with lots of color tones in varying scenes to keep things alive. And many of the furniture is back in style 86 years later.
