Although not mentioned very often, "Don't look in the basement" is a very interesting movie and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is employed at Stephens Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens after being murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to plague Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters seems like she's saving something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up with and sympathize with during climax, which doesn't happen very often in horror movie. The musical score is great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", the show by Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all good, the story is very exciting with a fantastic twist ending. This movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other movie I've ever seen has been able to catch. Many horror fans have never seen or even heard about this movie, which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic. "Don't look at the basement" is definitely worth watching for all fans of the 1970's drive-in movie.
