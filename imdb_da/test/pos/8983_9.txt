This movie grabs you from the opening scene and never lets go. You look industrious at seeing Janos Szaba's excitement about coming to America. He's a nice guy. You cannot help loving Himself when His zeal is replaced by bitterness that His fortunes become. You know that in his case you would be forced to make the same choices he made to survive. This film comments on the worship of beauty and everything superficial in society and is only more true in the twenty-first century culture. Janos himself becomes the victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you are young and beautiful if you could see you would have the world." And like many a modern gangster movie, when her security is threatened, he extracts a vigorous revenge. His innocence is not completely lost, but he requires an equal price for himself, knowing that he deserves his fate. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in good shape in this lead role. Few players could convincingly implement this character's conversion from innocent to cursed criminal in 60 seconds. Lorre is well supported by all casts, making this a true ensemble image and not just a star-to-vehicle. With a slightly less preaching dialogue, this movie will be a 10. Recommended.
