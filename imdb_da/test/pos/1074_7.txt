It's not about wine. No, Nossiter's real goals are those that will streamline and assimilate the characteristics of local production (wine) for business purposes. For this purpose, he has made an excellent, objective film. Spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawless independent winemakers are equated with media refinements, anodynamic and American-Europeans: the art of winemaking against market-driven, laboratory-based product manufacturing. It is an open show that does not lead to conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's films are occasionally monstrous to look at - cameras are neither hidden nor steadicam in any way. There are also lots of captions as well as subtitles to wade through, often for a short time on the screen. <br /> <br /> But it surpasses Michael Moore in the game Moore can't play anyway. The signs speak for - and therefore condemn - themselves. Worth seeing 7/10
