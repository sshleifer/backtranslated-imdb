I don't want to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it doesn't fit the movie. The rest of Imaginary Heroes, however, depicted a realistic family through realistic problems such as death, drugs, relationships and colleges. I could have sworn that they were my own family, no joke. <br /> <br /> Emile Hirsch was completely credible as a teenager struggling with her brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her a little dysfunctional family together. Although this family can take their questions to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they are going through, whether it is exams, experiences or parents.
