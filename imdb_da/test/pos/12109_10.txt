This is a film about the music currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two ancient world superpowers, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. So it is no surprise that a lot of music is played in Istanbul with a large selection of voices, styles and influences from all over the globe. It is of course Turkish music, and I was fascinated by Turkish music ever since I bought my first record long ago. The film contains various singers, instrumentalists and bands. Spoken comments from the musicians nicely show the music being played and the social context of modern Turkey. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the films show urban scenes mainly from Istanbul, which is very pleasant to see. <br/> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" is documentary and contains music from minorities, for example. Kurds and Roma. Other important issues are omitted as Turkish jazz music or Armenian and Greek music. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended for lovers of Turkey, the Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean music and culture and the Middle East. It can also be worthwhile for those with great interest in the global effects of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
