This film was overshadowed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), released the same year. After watching both movies, I can honestly say that this is the superior movie. <br /> <br /> Given, the production value of 'The Jackal' was very good, it probably had a significantly larger budget. But 'The Assignment' is well-written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did a good job of establishing a deep and majority relationship between the title character and his family. I liked the end. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of the Jack Ryan character in the Tom Clancy movies. Both are naval officers thrown into incredibly dangerous roles as they conceally work on behalf of national security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be both virile and gentle. They have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationship with their families. <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is how the opinions of everyone who has written on this movie (even included) can be so much more positive than the lukewarm reception movie has received. This is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety to remain convincing for multiple views. If you're a fan of spy genre movies, I highly recommend 'The Assignment'.
