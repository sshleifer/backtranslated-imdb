Forever strong is one of the sports movies you can actually see. It reminded me a lot about Remember the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and just awesomeness. I saw it on a pre-screen, and all my friends liked it and put it easily in their top 2 sports movies. The action is amazing in the movie. Although it looks like Remember Titans, there is something very unique about this movie. I feel this is definitely Oscar worthy and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely watch this movie and it's worth your $ 10. I will have to watch it again when it comes out because it was so good. I can't say a bad thing about the movie.
