Beware of the Scottish game! Dario Argento returns to his classical form in his raging and appalling opera, and recovers the compromise he lost while filming agitated and scary psychosocialists such as Tenebre and Phenomena. In fact, based on a simple narrative outweighed by lavish sets of pieces, imaginative brutal murders and refined photography, the movie feels like the Argento we once knew. The only real violation of the opera is the lack of a score from Goblin, which gave unusual, iconic and timeless music to many of Argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful). <br /> <br /> Production is filled by several competent players. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra lookalike Cristina Marsillach manages enough picking and compassion to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror movie helmet-turn-opera director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively short role (see the presentation of featurette on the DVD for a hilarious interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly brash and scornful at the end of her relationship with Argento!) Fans of Stage Fright (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by Michele Soavi, who served as the second unit director of Opera) will hardly recognize the final girl of that movie, Barbara Cupisti, as a scene manager here (I think these are the glasses, that does it ). <br /> <br /> With me, it is often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with lonely nightmarish images makes him my ideal film maker. Opera is full of minor details that left me smirking. For example, I love that we never see "The Great" Mara Czekova's face. I also love the scene where the killer scratches the top of his deadly sharp dagger across a TV screen showing Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I hesitate even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to crawl as "pin grates" are placed over Betty's eyes. In short, Opera is a clean, exciting and thrilled thriller. With its solid performances, lucid focus and literature community, it is to be in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Can Opera be the last big giallo?
