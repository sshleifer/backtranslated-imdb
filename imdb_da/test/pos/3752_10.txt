The main reason I loved this movie is that IMx (previously immature) was in it. They were in Lot 3 when they were 11, but they are all adults now! I was a little shocked by some of the things they did in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but I had to realize they weren't my little boys anymore. I think Chris Stokes did a pretty good job when it was his first movie.
