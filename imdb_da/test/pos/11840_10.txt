I think this show is great !!! I love it and I love Fabian (not in a romantic kind of way), but if I were there I would totally support Fabian as Haley did and the other girls, yes !! I mean, if they are red, why don't you fight them back !! Fabian is the only one who has the courage to confront people and say what he means, not just stay and suck it !!! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I love Haley too, because shes like a normal girl who will not be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere, and sleeping in a warm bed with waiters, I mean if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do it !! ! and Fabian also, Fabian brought pizza and like 2 or 3 people said thanks, I mean he spends money !!
