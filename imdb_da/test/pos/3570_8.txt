This movie is one to spend short time, entertainment, but who could then be made in no country that has nothing identifies the "Colombians". Who is looking for the topics of the supposed Colombian or socially and politically correct cinema, and what it is termed "it threatens," it is better than it will not see this movie. Some to the drug traffic, or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker, or wing guerilla and to the kidnapping politically. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a character where it could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also the character of the protagonist, an Argentine photographer, it could be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and the frequent "boludo" in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang in any other country without character or history changes. The most important thing is that it is a very decent spoken story with pictures and real performances. Its quality is almost television, but of the good. That if a movie like this, if it deserves or doesn't deserve the support of the public, is a bit of a classic discussion "mamerta".
