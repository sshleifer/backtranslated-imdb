Good as opposed to most .... I went into this movie and expect it was not so good and it turned out to be a great movie. Pretty cool plot I love the idea of ​​it, but what really made this movie was the actors. They all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together. It's a movie where you think right away you will be able to predict what will happen, but it doesn't quite show how you predicted. I will not give anything about the story, so I do not want to ... but I suggest giving this a chance. If you saw the movie Money Train and enjoyed it, you would love this movie. Maybe all that Lawrence Fishburn touches is gold?
