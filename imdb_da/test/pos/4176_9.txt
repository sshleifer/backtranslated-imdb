"Head" is a movie that has been good since its original release in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the monks in a way that their fans never understood them; men with real thoughts. The monks were completely controlled by their producers, and were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The movie pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie worth seeing over and over again.
