If you're looking for a movie with great music, fine cast and a story that's not hard to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie; Some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. I think the editing is wonderful, really fast and often fun. Shure, perhaps there would have been some more potential on the whole, the whole story being somehow on the surface; maybe a little too many characters are involved. But I don't care because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. The piece is as raw, funky and filmed in a special way (hand-camera style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clip; The only similar energy I might find in Bette Midler's "Rosen", the whole concert film. It's about catching something "wild" that is "right" and doesn't just make it perfect; take a roof. <br /> <br /> So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgia trip to when synthesizers where heavy and walk-men aren't available. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone.
