The famous and mysterious recluse Raymar, a kind of deadly telekinetic mental vampire, suddenly dies under bizarre conditions. Nice girl high school student Julie Wells (a warm and sympathetic performance of the lovely Meg Tilly) desperately wants to be accepted by the snobby clique sisters (played for sublime bitchy perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the always combed Elizabeth Daily), so She advocates spending a night in a cruel mausoleum where Raymar's body has been implicated as part of an initial rite. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it becomes a very long and awful night with pure nerve-wracking terror for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the serene tongue-in-cheek "Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives") scares graphically into favor of creating a blast and eerie atmosphere but fails to pull this particular out because the first hour is too slow, talky and uneventful to be distant scary or suspenseful. However, I found nevertheless this flawed scream flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining. The big poofy hairdos, a steady music montage sequence, badly timed fake scares (including ubiquitous hand on shoulder gag!), A scene on a glittering video game arcade, kids pleasing smoking pot and the hilarious silly teen slang ("nerdy brain"!? ) Give this picture a certain endearingly picturesque 80-year-old charm. Hal Trussell's beautiful, polished filmography (I especially dug the sliding Steadicam tracking shots), Bob Summers spooky, but funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's splendid ghoulish makeup f / x is up to snuff. The still-Adam West of the TV's "Batman" fame only takes place in no secondary part. The mausoleum gives an impressive large and disturbing main location. The grand finale with a bunch of gruesome rotting bodies popping out of their coffins and floating over qualifies as a wonderfully macabre shock-set piece. Sure, this baby is definitely not an unwarranted fuzzy gem, but it still delivers lots of pleasantly silly and derived cheesy fun all of it.
