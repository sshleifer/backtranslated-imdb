Compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god of play - a true piece of art. But compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest in namco's superior slash em up series is ambitious. The attempts to improve perfection are not entirely successful. There are new modes and gameplay that I praise for trying to raise the series to new heights - but they just complicate things. Examples? Now, punctuation mode is a good idea in theory, but in reality there are plenty of limitations and is no way that can be customized like the one found in the wwe games for example. Chronicles of sword fashion is fun and thought-provoking for a while, but ultimately draws on and deliberately a task to make money over a really fun game. Also the tale of soul fashion, which is basically arcade mode with small bits of inconsistent history and shenmue style QTR bits thrown in really feels slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! YoU not kNoW WhAt yOuR SaYiNg" is probably what more of you think, but don't understand it twisted - I don't hate this game - this game is amazing! It still has the classic game (although some characters are moving, unnecessarily modified), amazing graphics and the epic soundtrack for which the games are known. And also on the good side of things are the new characters (especially zasalamel), all of which are cool in their own way (except setsuka-yes I know I'm nitpicking). It's just what compared to soul calibur 1 and 2 it feels like it's trying to be much more than it actually is. It does not mean that it is not a classic, it just means that compared to its own high standards, it falls a little short, although more characters move phases and better graphics than ever. <br /> <br /> Still, soul calibur 3 dries the floor with 95% of games out there - and it counts for something! Oh, and all those who mark this review as "unhelpful" feel so bad that I insulted their beloved setsuka. Well listen to fanboy / girl: SHE is not really! And even though she was, she would not be caught dead with you.
