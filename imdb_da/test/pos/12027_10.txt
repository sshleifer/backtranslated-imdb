I laughed my ass for an hour. I didn't know who Dan Finneity was. Why haven't I heard of Dan Finnerty before? He is hysterical and also his backup singers. They make all these women's songs that we will never hear a new experience. They blow those songs away. This was at Bravo last night. Why is this Dan guy being "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma to burn! He blew me away with this show! I just read on the Internet that he was once a member of "Stomp" I think there is nothing he cannot do. I saw "Stomp" at a UCLA theater years ago and the guys were amazing. This show last night was made by Dreamworks! Does this mean that spielberg did this? Why don't they steal this Dan Finnerty in a movie. There was a standing ovation at the end of this show, and every time the camera was cut to the audience, everyone was in it, singing or dancing. The whole show had this amazing energy. My only complaint was that it was no longer, but looking back when you see how much energy these guys put out, I suppose it would be impossible for any man to perform with such a gusto for over an hour. Man I loved this show!
