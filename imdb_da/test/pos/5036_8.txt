This is one of my favorite "Capra-esque" comedies. This film is intended to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. It's not religious comment. It is fun. It's fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect an expectation level that professional film critics have made us think to be part of every movie. <br /> <br /> Others have described Travolta's role (that's why you watch the movie over and over) and the excellent support casting (including Sparky!). Sometimes a cigar is only a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
