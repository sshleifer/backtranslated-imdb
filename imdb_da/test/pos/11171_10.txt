This is a very well-written movie full of excitement right up to the end! The setting is beautiful as opposed to the scary action taking place there! It's not your typical thrill, but a movie well packed with interesting phrases and surprises that leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel. I recommend this movie to all exciting lovers!
