Ever since 'Midnight Cowboy' I have been looking for movies with Dustin Hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. Ever since 'Kramer vs Kramer' I have been looking for movies with Meryl Streep and have mostly not been disappointed. She gave an excellent performance, truly one of her best in `Sophie's Decision 'and I patched her up in' Out of Africa '. The fact that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for Kramer vs Kramer was definitely a great idea: The result is an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> On divorce everyone has a pretty bad time, even though the kids seem to like most ?????? .. Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original instructions that present some memorable scenes: even the passage takes on character and must be included in the cast! And for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just simply magnificent. How do you get an eight-year trade? Benton succeeded, and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is definitely engaging, endearing and convincing. Justin Henry's achievements should be among the best 5 or 6 children's performances all the time. The best thing was once again the nature, there was no time over the top, so frequent these days. <br /> <br /> This movie came back on the small screen the second night, even though I've had it in my video collection for years: it's still worth seeing and paying attention to everything. About 7Â½ out of 10.
