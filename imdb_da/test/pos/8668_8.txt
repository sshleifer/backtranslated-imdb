At first glance, The Bothersome Man works as several other films / books rolled into one. Kafka's Trial, Melville's Bartleby, Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day come to mind immediately. A man, Andreas, arrives in a nameless city, where he immediately gets a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. But there is a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, bland and completely characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation-interior design. Welcome to the whole of modern consumerism where people throw themselves away from buildings, and no one raises an eyebrow, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs and eating food that tastes of nothing. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his difficulties and spends the rest of the movie trying to escape in various ways. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend, she is just as sad as the old one - a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to come in with him and everything she can say is, 'I don't mind'. In fact, much is said what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before, and after approx. 45 minutes you begin to feel that you are actually experiencing some sense of deja vu. Still, it is likely to be worth repeating over and over again: An unexplored life is a life that is not worth living. Added to that, a certain modern take on the multi-annual theme of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one sign reminded me of people I have known, especially his furniture-occupied girlfriend, and if the movie's ending has run out of ideas, maybe it's the point - there will be no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation.
