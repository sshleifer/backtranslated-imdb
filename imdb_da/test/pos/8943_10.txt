I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it's fun fun from start to finish. The reason is simple and straight forward, but it keeps you looking and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. When I went to watch this movie, I hadn't heard much about it and I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be an old ladies type movie like Calendar Girls or something, but it took me quite surprised. Even though I'm still a teenager and the movie probably wasn't targeting my age group, I still found it excellent, and I think people of all ages would like it. I think it's a shame that it's not famous at all, and it deserves more advertising so more people will go and see it and realize what a big movie is.
