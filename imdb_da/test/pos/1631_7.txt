I go to the cinema to be entertained. I was very much entertained by the first movie in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had lots of turns around to keep me very interested. Angels and demons are no different. If you have had the DaVinci code, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well. Angels and demons are made pretty much the same style as the previous movie, but faster that I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for two hours without boring me a bit. What I really liked about this movie was that although it is of course fictitious, they probably leave real history to make it seem very credible. If there is one thing I did not like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very incredible (will not give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained all over and was very happy with what I saw.
