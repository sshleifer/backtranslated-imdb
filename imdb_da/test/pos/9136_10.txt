I decided to comment on this amazing movie because here at IMDb, John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-American years, but totally ruined his reputation recently in US movies, plans to reinstate it. Now, here are a few reasons why this is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: The movie's plot is simple and even clich√© with today's standards, but what makes the movie a masterpiece is by the four leaders, unique direction of Mellville, movies, music and style. There is no way that a director today can make such films, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's Box-office-targeted movie business. <br /> <br /> John Woo made a more or less decent movie that borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by huge budgets and expensive (in wages) but cheap (in acting) actors. So what I say is that this is one of the greatest movies ever made with another movie by Melville - Le Samourai. See it. And even if the remake is made, try to avoid it before you first see the big original first.
