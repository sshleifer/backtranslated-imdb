Well made melodrama that tells the story of Sally, tomboy dances in the circus, raised by sideshow performer McGargle (played by WC Fields), he of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants and skill like juggler, pickpocket and runner of carnival con game like Three Card Monte and Old Shell Game. McGargle has traveled Sally, who cultivates him as his "real father" since Sally's mother (kicked out of her home by her father, a judge when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally orphans. Sally is frivolous and loyal to McGargle, no matter what he stands for - but McGargle seems to be feeling a little guilty of keeping her in the circus rather than with her own family all these years. When they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her rich grandparents live, McGargle applies the opportunity to "examine" Sally's true family with the idea that he can restore her to them. But grandfather judge welcomes Sally immediately because he doesn't like a "show girl" - what a strict, narrow man he is, a real job that guy! And in the meantime, Sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, the son of the man, who helped grandpa get his riches. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with a few laughs here and there and some kind of strange editing style (I don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots, so kind of jump back a few seconds or change the angle suddenly as a close-up appears). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is lovely here - pretty sweet and comical in her performance. TOILET. Fields, even without his famous voice, are very fun - just as he moves and his entertaining, comical reactions to things (like a little dog seen in a fun scene), we even see him juggling briefly in this. I love the few peeks on the old-fashioned circus and carnival shown here. The expression of this highlighted on the DVD is very nice appearance, toned a bright sepia tone, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by Philip Carli based on the original cue sheets.
