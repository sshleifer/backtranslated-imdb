As I saw "Wirey Spindell" I couldn't laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey sure got a lot of games from both boys and women, but I was confused as to why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed age to like 20 to play Wirey when he was a senior in HS ... but anything, I thought it was fun.
