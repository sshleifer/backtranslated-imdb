I've seen a few films from the Far East recently ..... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, Eye), and some were not that big (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are those like Uzumaki and Return, which while I still failed. <br /> <br /> The basic premise involves the mysterious and terrible effects that a growing occupation of spirals has on a community. Sound silly? Yes, that was what I was thinking. First, the good things. The direction was top notch, sure a little over the top in places, but never less interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and, like other writers, much lovelace-esq commented ... it was interesting. What it reminded me of most, however, was early Cronenberg; films like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The action wasn't great, but not horrible either. To be honest I was actually sorry a few times. I felt paced, especially in the beginning was a little slow. My main problem was that it was too stupid and fun to be true horror, and yet not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =) and I liked the final shot / voiceover. At first I thought it ended too suddenly, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and liked the end. But because of the lack of seriousness in history combined with the top scenes of the news report at school, I do not care about the characters in the end. The final scene, which might be a bit poignant, while in reality I really couldn't care for the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> So generally I liked this movie, but it frustrated me, and I think there was a real potential beyond some good scenes. Some other points, the main girl is pretty beautiful and sweet, and the song that plays at the end is also good. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
