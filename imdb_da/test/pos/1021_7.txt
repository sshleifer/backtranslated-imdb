An enjoyable movie, undoubtedly, and very evocative for both its era and the very special stage of any boys' rites of passage. But I have to say that after reading the very positive comments here, I was a little disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing is about the most skewed part of miscasting in the history of school actors. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star twists, but a filander, is risible. And without that, nada. The subplotters bore no relation that I could see to the main plot - all could be removed in their entirety without in any way influencing the main story - which certainly suggests a fundamental error. When all your subplots look like padding, you know that a central idea extends beyond its boundaries. Nevertheless, it is a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated by the final 'cut!' The good feeling permeates the film. And it must count on something. A flawless really good movie. 7 out of 10
