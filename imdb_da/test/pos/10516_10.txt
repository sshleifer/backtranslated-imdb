Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that history lacks critical details in several places, but I just continued to examine Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in history, and she didn't let me go. The look in the eyes of the last scene, which she designs against, literally puts one foot in front of the other against her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face-to-face play ever. I believed her completely, possibly because I have known and admired several "hard broads" that survived similar abuse situations. And they did it without becoming human-hated, but it is my own hopeful projection of the Foundation's character at BREAK UP.
