I think this is one of the best movies all the time. I just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about. Would love to know what others are thinking too. The actor was just finished. Where's Tate anyway? It's been a while since I've seen him in something, but I think he's got out, did his performance in this movie!
