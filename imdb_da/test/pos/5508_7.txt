Everyone told me this movie was not really good and sick etc. So I finally rented it and I was amazed at it. I thought the torture would be much worse, but it was shocking at the end, but it was about it. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the silence of the lamb and / or kiss girls category. It was sometimes stupid, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> Nominated R - Too strong torture, violence, language and sexuality
