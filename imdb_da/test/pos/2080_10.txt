I've seen different Hamlets and I've learned the play. As I see Jacobi, I am tempted to believe that he is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive he is in all shades of this character. He elaborates, rather than solves, every puzzle about Hamlet's character. He highlights the line by line, word by word, shines light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, we betray Hamlet by his betrayal - far more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain more profound than anyone else. And we shake Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness that Hamlet can come down. In short, Jacobi gives us the full Hamlet, and Hamlet as a whole is the greatest character in the literature. That's why I'm happy that Jacobis Hamlet is the best performance I've seen by an actor.
