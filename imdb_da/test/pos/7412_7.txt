I just watched this movie in a snap preview, and before reading my comment you need to know it's very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, House and Music like that. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever he called) died in an accident: he fell off a roof, "drunk". Carl meets with his brother's boyfriend Sunny, and the two of them simply escaped a private investigation into Jason's death, and Carl becomes involved in Jason's past life filled with clubs and drugs. The film itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is no more than a large pile of s ** t. .. the list is endless) and most of the actions such as. The reason is just not credible. Matthew Rhys performance of the stupid boy who comes to great London and suddenly takes drugs from people he doesn't even know doesn't seem very credible, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, performed by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic to spectator. Nothing more than a joke was Tim Curry's performance by the doctor King Damian: a fake caricature, also "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true. BUT: If you like club music (the club scenes as the selected tracks are simply brilliant), if you enjoy a simple love with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes, I confess, I lost my heart;) ... it makes my comment yet more subjective, I think) with some (predictable) terms you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone else: Forget ... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)
