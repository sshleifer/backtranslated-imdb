Linda Blair has been trading for forty years now, and while she will never escape Regan MacNeil in "The Exorcist", few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status for as much effect as "Witchery" does. She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel, which her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth), and when they arrive at the island, they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer's wife (Leslie Cumming) who illegally hang out at the hotel while examining the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a long time ago witch hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with children at that time. Jane is unaware of the father, Jane has recently dreamed of the witch's dramatic death, and Jane's little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by his haunted, black-clad spirit, which he calls "the lady of black". The group's time on the island the inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them, however, Lady in Black has already sent the captain on their rented boat (George Stevens). Before long, isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of mood and excitement that Lady in Black begins to count terror. She plans to avenge her own destiny by possessing Jane and sacrificing her friends and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills one aspect of her avenged curse - greed, lust, and blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she kills them one by one in cruel, terrible ways. The island location is efficiently scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. It's such a colorful movie reminiscent of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is excellent and the decorated decoration is absolutely scary. The soundtrack is very efficient and unique. The horror effects are extreme, scary and unforgettable. The kinematics are amazing, and that's what brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this movie shoots her like a horror star should shoot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups detailing Jane's incremental possession and moments reminiscent of other great horror movies. There are hidden greetings to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and of course "The Exorcist". She does a good job and definitely steals the show with her moody and underrated performance. That's not to say the rest of the cast drawers; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran artist Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's bitchy Mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives it his best, but he is not essentially a movie star, and his TV person gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The movie is otherwise so fierce and scary (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003's "Monster Makers" and her motherly scenes in that movie have the same tenderness for them). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a big witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Together with Blair she was also the perfect cast. But it's Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic abilities, and this aspect of the movie goes back to "Exorcist II: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre work to date.
