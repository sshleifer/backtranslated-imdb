WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s who is celebrating a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands in the period. He not only plays their music to the note, but also lives the lives of his idols. When his friends in the tribute show him, in search of some originality, fate plays a good turn and is hired to replace the guitarist's lead songs. A dream came true? Well, almost. As he begins to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex transgressions of the 80s rock scene, he must also face the problems of his supportive boyfriend and eventually respond to questions of creativity and a proverb in the band's music. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons is that it's one of the first times the hard metal rock's life and music is shown in a realistic way. Fans of the music genre will be met by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original and the question of how an artist lives his life and creates his art is done in a sensible and balanced way. Action is pretty good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action games I saw him last, and Jennifer Aniston is in line with the nice-girl-who-know-a-lot-about-life role. More problematic is the end, which is quite conventional and can disappoint. It resembles the protagonist after saying of the great and famous band that has found its own creative path. But in an ironic twist, the music he plays in the club at the end is worst in the whole movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth to see - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you don't like this kind of music, you can choose to avoid this movie.
