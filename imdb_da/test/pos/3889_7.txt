Any movie that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supportive cast should be worth watching, and the comic Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the amazing talent he recruited for his 2007 direct debut, a dreary bag of overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Known as Larry David's manager Jeff on "Curb Your Enthusiasm," plays Garlin James, an ever-struggling 39-year-old Chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comical way he looks at his single status, which makes his dilemma involved. If the story sounds a little familiar, it is because the film is partly a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic, "Marty", about a lonely Bronx butcher who lives with his fellow mother mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the game that James is desperate to do, as he is so empathetic to the character of the character. Of course, there is a love story of this kind in this new millennium, and Silverman plays Beth, an off-kilter, sexually gigantic ice cream server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. Their best scene together is in his favorite store, where they improvise different characters at different times. Hunt plays a lonely primary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They accidentally meet in a record store and then again on a career day at her school where he hilariously exhibits his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of first graders, including his best friend Lucas pert-daughter Penelope (played by Dakota Fanning's look- like baby sister Elle). In a squatted como and looks a bit like Jerri Blank plays the Sedaris school counselor who speaks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement consultant, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy report that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the movie is character actor My Kolb, who plays James' pixelated mother with picks and hearts. There are also unexpected cameos from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask, but set-up is fun), as well as sharply played pieces by director Paul Mazursky (as the snaky director of a sincere camera show, "Smear Job ", Tim Kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of that show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the hard love shop owner). With its rueful outbursts of insecurity and self-suffering, Garlin's comic sensibilities resemble Albert Brooks, and informal dialogue at best recalls "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life". The one persistent problem I had with the movie is pacing, as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin tries to establish the right pace, and the lack of real conflict increases inertia. Whatever he does well, he is able to capture the gnawing sense of desperation one feels by the revelation that life is not what it should be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a stable diet The junk food eaten on a car hood is the only safe thing when it comes to satisfaction.
