The trailer does not go nearby and only scratches the film's surface and rightly so, not because it has this obligation to keep its real story under wraps, but because what actually shows up will cause completely different lines of question marks, some of which is frustratingly unanswered in the movie, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the events. This of course means plenty of material for an after-show discussion. <br /> <br /> Metaphorically, the box refers to how people tend to unknowingly hide us into everyday situations or things, and how our attached thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, rarely out of the box. . There is a speech made at the end of one of the characters that will let you consider this fact which governs the basis of the entire movie and even teases existentialism, where our bodies are pure ships of the soul and from cradle to grave. We put in several boxes in a lifestyle. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the movie is how it tried to sound intelligently through the frequent name dropping by hidden government agencies like the CIA and NSA, as if there is something overtly secret about these agencies, which we should be aware of. They serve a little different purpose than putting any action and everybody under control that no one can trust, destroy chaos in the sense of both the characters and the audience, as we try to stop trusting in helping the interpretation of narration. Having seen it in 1976, against a NASA backdrop of manned space missions and in Langley, Virginia, also gave the increased sense of caution that will sap your energies while sitting through it patiently. <br /> <br /> Based on the short story Button, Button written by Richard Matheson and made for an episode of the Twilight Zone, the story follows the Lewis family, where man Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his teaches wife Norma (Cameron Diaz), and you think it's all happy family with their son Walter (Sam Oz Stone), until one day a mysterious man called Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a two-face inspired face effect ), as we are preempted in the opening, come knocking and giving them a Deal or No Deal button in a box. The dive button and they get a million dollars (we are talking in dollars in the 70's here), although a stranger out there will die. If they do not, then the agreement has an expiration date. The story would dictate an agreement that naturally sparks from a mysterious sequence of events unfolding, with even more shady characters (eg, who nosebleed) appearing, some being inexplicable zombie as apparently all under influence or employment, or Arlington steward. Whether Steward is dead, remains a secret government official, a messenger from God, or a representative of foreigners after an anal probe, unanswered, so it is as if he is delivering something that is expected just to pray that man will shake off his innate greed so that his work can be cut short and come back to where he came from. <br /> <br /> If you need a little distraction from the various scenes that make up the narrative, the production and the art direction are beautiful to restore the appearance of the 70's as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences That stems from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. It is full circle this study of human nature, our greed for instant gratification, which manifests its long-term result of pain, confusion and further choices that we will make based on genuine sacrifices. Nifty special effects also come into play, although it just leaves more space open to the movie's genre. <br /> <br /> Is it horror, science fiction or a mysterious thriller? It is everything rolled into an actual along with a sprinkling of the philosophical. Just don't wait a straight narrative movie with clean and easy answers at the end ?? This is like an X-Files episode on steroids.
