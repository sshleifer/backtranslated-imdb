The people of my generation and the elderly who know about WW II (or as it is called in Russia - The Great Patriotic War), not only from the school books, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. My grandfather was a soldier at Stalingrad, and when I was a little girl, I used to listen to his stories about how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was gloomy. But it was a long time ago, and no, when I have a conscious interest in what happened in the battle of Stalingrad, I must return to books and movies for information. Somehow, most films I saw were made in the Soviet Union only in today's Russia. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. The film describes the war on the opposite side, and the fact itself is interesting. Everything that appears in the movie is completely different from what I am used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of much of Remarque's "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben", because the war is shown by a common German soldier's view. And this soldier or lieutenant is quite obsessed with repeating that he is in no way fascist. The movie heroes from the cozy and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast, come in the snow-covered, hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; It is clear from the beginning. After the elite solution had participated in their first battle at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the sentence that reflected the whole idea for me; He said "If you start thinking, you will get angry." And in my opinion, this also applies to the crowd. On the one hand, one might think OK, I just want to look at this movie, and it won't disappear me, I don't have to be upset about the people on the screen as they were who attacked my country and not the other way around. But sooner or later, but inevitably one begins to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant stifles his tears back and sees Kolya's performance. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to see, all of these frostbite legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, broken illusions. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, Lt. Hans von Witzland one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his stellar position. I saw a lot of Hollywood movies, where he got immaterial parts of little fries, like "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do that?!). And after seeing "Stalingrad", I can't prove that European players want to appear in American films, even judged at any cost. In fact, I am deeply joking. I think Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he gets in Hollywood. And out of what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, beyond the doubt. In my opinion, the worst "Stalingrad" disadvantage is the way they speak Russian in the movie. Of course I mean those who should be Russian. Say the boy who has spent some time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really that hard to find actors able to pronounce a few sentences without the awful accent? Originally I sat down to see "Stalingrad" just to listen to native German speakers because I study the language. I didn't expect anything extraordinary from the movie. But it impressed me, made me cry when I didn't want to. I know I am 15 years late to see it, but "Stalingrad" is not a huge movie, and after 15 years it is still visible and shocking.
