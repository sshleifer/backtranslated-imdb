Amateur camera works aside, I thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I've read, I got something completely different from the end. History's performance is about a very religious family and their ties to their church. How to comply with all the rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have trouble keeping track, what about odd thoughts about others and her use of bad language. Yet she asks a lot, like the family. So one day they lead a church technique and are in an accident. From here, the parents and her brother change; how about being knocked out and "saved" by Jesus. WARNING: MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Or we are led to believe. I think if you look at this movie only from the daughter's point of view, be aware of the end you want to see that what we, the audience think is an actual occurrence with the parents and son, is actually a dream, and from daughter's POV. This would explain many of the actions the parents and son portrayed, which were quite the opposite of how they lived before, especially the sexes, and would also explain why Peggy came away with murder, etc. Look at how perfect that pie is, but go back and look at the cake Betty does. That is, unless Caroline removed all the evidence that the cake was twisted. And also the fact that the scene in which she sees her dead parents lies in each other's arms and the brother, who all seemed to die very peacefully, even though they were poisoned, suited to a dream sequence.
