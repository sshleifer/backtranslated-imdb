Anyone who has seen the trailer for this movie would be forgiven for thinking about this movie is an out and about comedy. In fact, it is a light hearted, but not overly fun, body on a pair of highwaymen. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in the movie. Scripture and plot are weak, and the love aspect of history is strangely boring. Despite all this, it's quite fun, thanks to the two leads Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two fine actors, Carlyle in particular, are always good to see and here there is a good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, gave us movies like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently GI Jane and the Enemy of the State. His debut is aimed at energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film fizzling together, although without the strong one he threw together, the results may not have worked so well. <br /> In short, if you're looking for an easy-to-enjoy movie to pass one and a half hours then you can do much worse than Plunkett and Macleane. On the other hand, if you fancy something subtle, historically accurate and thoughtful, go elsewhere. 10.7.
