I couldn't believe the adult swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. When I finally saw the pilot, I assume that I hold on to a few episodes. Assy is pretty funny, and the whole crew of police shows signs are around, but Assy is hard to understand and it was a little frustrating. Most of the humor is that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing but bones that sport socks with socks and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays by his own rules" that you may have guessed. The only other fun moments are Assy, who shoots many, many people and spends time at home - in the bathroom. It's not Squidbillies fun but it's worth seeing.
