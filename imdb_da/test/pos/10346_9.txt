A touching film about a talented woman struggling with a society and a love that structurally underestimates her. The questions are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in Dutch society today. This film is a tribute to all modern women without living on feminism. Not only is the story told, the play and the landscape are also good.
