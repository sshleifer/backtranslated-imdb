A really fun British comedy from the mid-1950s on a school for girls. The girls are all involved in evil and chaos, making bathtub gin, smoking and gambling. Alastair Sim plays Headmistress Millicent in a glorious wooden role, and plays Millicent's brother. A female police officer goes to the school's undercover to see what's going on. This movie is fun, has good sight gags and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic British comedy, very fun and not for cruse. Joan Sims ans Sid James, stars of many Carry On movies, plays small roles, but this movie is about the girls. It created 3 successors and a new reinstatement. See and enjoy where it all began.
