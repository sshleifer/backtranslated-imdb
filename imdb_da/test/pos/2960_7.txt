A wounded Tonto stands alone to protect three innocent lives. A rude woman masterminding a deadly plot. Race voltage. Smart Indians. <br /> <br /> It's rarely seen in the TV series, but this movie adds them all to the mix. Although this is definitely a Lone Ranger movie, it blends in with the formula just as well, that those who got tired of the series would probably enjoy it. Definitely recommended for any fan.
