Talk about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (The Waterfall Out) came up with a cute and creative trailer that totally spoiled Star Wars. This gem is so jammed packed with tribute and gags, I laugh every time! Not only that, as Star Wars made a reissue with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a spoof that just won't die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed, he even rented the waterfall to work on the "Jediens Return" (Don't believe me, check his post in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This should be the first and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. I think the Special Edition was a bit overdone, but after reflection I think it is perfect for the modern release of Star Wars, and it turns out that sometimes it is wrong to blush with perfection. Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth your time. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you cry, you will kiss $ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be really happy you did.
