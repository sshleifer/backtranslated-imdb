I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it quite hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is sooo incredibly thick sometimes and just says the sad things ... but at the same time he is just cold to impress his girlfriend (who is arrested anyway!) The beach landscape is very quiet ... until long comes Robbie Coltrane ...! Not the greatest movie ever made, but definitely something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you don't have much else to do (as I did). You may have to chase it for yourself - I was lucky that my local video store ordered it.
