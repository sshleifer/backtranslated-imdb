I think Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. It is one of the only films that, besides some well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually work. In my opinion, the plot is captivating. It keeps your attention without having a monstrous story that couldn't happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect movie to be in to show off his talent. He is very undervalued and does not get the recognition he deserves. Other films that he has been to other actors have been in the limelight, but this film and Rudy really show him because he is the protagonist of both. I hope someday he gets the acclaim he deserves for his acting. If you want to watch a great movie, check this out and if you are Sean Astin fan, you will definitely like this movie.
