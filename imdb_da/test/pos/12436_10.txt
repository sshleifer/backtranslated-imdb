This movie was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the wittiest, dottiest and most harmless piece of fun ever made. It simply couldn't go wrong with the cast of brilliant British character players that boast. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-dito; the wonderful alkward, innocent Gossage, played to the perfection of the imperious Joyce Grenfell. The caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (a Guy Middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up the post-war middle class England for a tee. <br /> <br /> The humor is sometimes obvious, but it is the special "Ealing" variety and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times than I would like to remember and still laugh as a drain on the ancient things every time. The storm of dorms occupied by the girls' school, the splendidly planned but ultimately doomed twin trips at school and the chaotic end that involves the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy are invaluable. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© I know, but they don't make them any more. How I wish they did. If you haven't seen it, please don't be disappointed.
