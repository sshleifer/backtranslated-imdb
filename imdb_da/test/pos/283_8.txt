In the 60s / 70s, David Jason was famous for his many supportive roles in television comedies like "Do not Adjust Your Set!", "Hark At Barker" and "Doctor" series. It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in London Weekend Television 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs', written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent for 'SIS' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He tries to do his job well, but it always seems like rowing up. Surprisingly, however, it always manages to get to the bottom of cases, much to the wonder of its colleagues - 'Buxton' (Michael Stainton), 'Spencer' (Mark Eden) and 'Cathy' (the lovely Elisabeth Counsel) who all respond to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell), a woman much like Michele Dotrice's' Betty 'from' Some Mother's Do 'Ave' Em! 'Have a sacred patience and stand by her brave (but well-meaning) man, no matter what. Like 'Some Mother's Do' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was completely twisted with slapstick. Each episode saw Jason perform stunts as a recess from a tall window sill or descending from the top of a ladder while decorating his apartment. It was 'Custard Pie in the face' really. <br /> <br /> 'Edgar Briggs' was not a big hit due to poor planning by I.T.V. A shame as it was an entertaining and fun show, well served by its star and the fine support cast. However, the leading man did not seem to have the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed the repeat screening of the show because he felt his action in it was unrefined. Granted David Jason, who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin', is different from the one that played Briggs, but by no means was his play unrefined. Most actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible, realistic figure. Strange, but not unthinkable. Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller', where he played the mother's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. Nor did it succeed in making the assessments. His lucky break came in the form of A.T.V's 'A Sharp Intake of Breath', where he played the disaster area 'Peter Barnes' in four series between 1977-1981. So, while it is not outstanding as such, 'Briggs' is an easy and dignified watch. Nice 'James Bond' style themed tune too!
