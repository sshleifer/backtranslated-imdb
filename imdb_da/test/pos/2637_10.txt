This movie was really fun. The people who expected to see an Oscar worthy comedy should come over themselves. This was a fun movie to watch with interesting and fun characters, plot lines, dialogue quotes and catch phrases. I judge a movie a 10 if I bought the DVD, or in this case the video tape, and have seen it many times, and in this case still laughing loudly. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about one and a half have nothing to do with Oscars. Again, it was just a fun, light hearted movie. I hope it comes out on DVD. I highly suggest checking out this movie if you are in the mood for a crazy comedy.
