This movie has some of the best dialogues ever written. The really good lines are all given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue. I just watched this movie again, for the first time in 20+ years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The bizarre going to the hospital is so imaginative to dazzle you. They often involve such a wonderful poetic justice as being near brilliant blows. I love this movie !!
