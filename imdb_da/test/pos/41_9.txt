What a wonderful movie, filled with eccentric, unique characters, wonderfully realized by a large ensemble cast. The director also did a great job of keeping the story together, getting the wonderful ideas (not cheating on them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha starring is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her in law and order, this really shows what she can do with a filled, complex role. Macy Gray is amazing, Mos Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, amazing. Jimmy Smits, great, and doesn't try to focus, because he's a star. A real piece of ensemble acting. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, groove it and treasure it. Something special.
