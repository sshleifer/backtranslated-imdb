I rank OPERA as one of the better Argento movies. Plot gaps and inconsistencies? Sure, but I don't think they detract from this movie as much as many other reviewers think. Many elements found in many of Argento's films are a bit "off-the-wall", but that is part of the drawing of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: Psycho closes opera's new leading lady. The typical Argento twists follow, leading to a decent payout of a climax. Not Argento is the best, but I still pull this out from time to time. Definitely worth seeing if you like his other things - just don't get this mixed up with the unpleasant PHANTOM OF OPERA remake that Argento did, one is really awful ... 8/10
