Imagine you being able to see yourself again as a child. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to talk to your younger self or even change him / you. Do you want to try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs based on your future experience? Or maybe the meeting would change your older self's perception of life and reality? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage in this complex thought by putting "older ones" Bruce Willis in a "younger self" collision course "Spenser Breslin" (from Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat "fame"). The result is a sometimes fun, sometimes touching encounter, which will make you consider your own past, present and future ?? and really believe it's never too late to change your course.
