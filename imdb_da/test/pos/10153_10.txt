Am I the only one who thinks this American version, far better than the English film from 1934? The English version has no excitement, looks antique and very low budgets and has unexceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, besides having the best production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American overseas, giving Doris Day its best role ever. With special attention the music - music from the American film is almost classic; Compare the "Albert Hall" sequences of both and you would agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (although it's pretty much the same music!). The only mistake in 1956 movies is the ridiculous meeting of the taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.
