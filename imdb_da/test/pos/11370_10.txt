I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember it as absolutely brilliant and convincing. At that time, I didn't know any of the British actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today's stars performed, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare in love "among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating" upstairs / downstairs "but also great in many plays). Like the other commentator, I'd like to see it again. I'm sure the production will remain timeless and I hope it has been or will be released on VHS or DVD. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it.
