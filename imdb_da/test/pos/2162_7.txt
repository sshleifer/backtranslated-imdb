Here is a much less known 50's sci-fi with a slightly different twist. A son of nuclear scientists is kidnapped and ransomed for the Father's Atomic Secrets. <br /> <br /> This is a tight knit atomic sci-fi thriller with high production values ​​and above average even from the baby. Atomic City actually has a movie experience unlike a lot of other 50s sci-fi from that time, which came out more like an episode of a TV show. Atomic City was also actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Play - how many other 50's sci-fi can get an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> Fantastic pacing, close direction and some great place to film in the "real" Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico makes this a worthwhile hunting down. The collector's print in circulation is an above average transfer and creates a fantastic dual function with Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
