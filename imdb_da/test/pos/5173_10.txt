My Santa Lucia Choir was chosen to be in this movie. All 100 plus. When it was time to film the film, I was asked to choose just 10. Oh my goodness. We had a little crazy going early to get her almonds out because she wanted to be in the movie. The choice was hard to make. The people of Georgetown are just as nice as the people they show in the movie. Gracious, kind, faithful. The city sponsors an annual Christmas market the first two weekend in December each year. I was there for years and it was wonderful. The city is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as it did when the film was made. Much credit goes to the historic community that works hard to preserve its historical value. The school's school leader, who has been converted into a charter school, was granted by the Colorado Governor for volunteers.
