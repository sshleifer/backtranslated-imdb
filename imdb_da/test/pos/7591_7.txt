Canthony is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing with a slightly older (by one year) Deanna Durbin. But I have to disagree with everything else he or she said, including running time - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (a single-reel). The song is not her best, of course; But it is fun and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch Turner. The duvet with Durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles, which nevertheless cool down reasonably well. The card is just a throwaway, but it is not as close as it is to the other reviewer. Honestly, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
