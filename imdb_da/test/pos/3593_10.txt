David Attenborough brings his fascination with the wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode tour of all the animals under the sea! The cinematography is amazing and really brings to the screen breathtaking footage of these whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they did it! Whether it's making models of creatures or the impressive pictures of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! 2001 had some good TV shows for our screen. But, unlike this documentary gem, they make them rather paralyzed! But in order to boast this documentary series as the best television series in 2001, it does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in the entertainment experience! All in all, this is the best TV show in 2001 with no competition, and perhaps the best TV series from the 2000s!
