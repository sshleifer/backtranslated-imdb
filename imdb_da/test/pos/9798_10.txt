Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are excellent in this excellent two-boy movie that has promised to "look after their mother" and how they manage when their new grandfather begins to beat the younger boy. It supports around the boys are also top class. Scripture really comes into the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood could grow up to see something like Tom Hanks, but it's nothing new in Hollywood. It is honestly my only criticism of the film.
