OK, so it is due to Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion it has its own voice and identity, mainly because of the music-video style, sketchy stories and good performances. Thomas Jane delivers great (drug dealer's show-down is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart also. James LeGros has a short and roaring look - good humor - "they got the Wong house". Porzikova's interrogation and rape scene are memorable, just as Mickey Rourke's cameo look - "take a top". <br /> <br /> Great Hollywood popcorn B production with strong A-level aspirants and renegade (Rourke) achievements. <br /> <br /> Well, take a highlight, it's worth it.
