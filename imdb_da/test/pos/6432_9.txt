I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr Hauer at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival for the US Prime Minister in this movie. Not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of BLADE RUNNER, he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the ROOM for a packed theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the movie I used it as a yardstick to compare every other movie I had seen at the festival. It was powerful and moving, yet subtle and short. The film tells the story of how a young man (the older version played by Rutger) one day finds himself attracted to a seemingly ordinary space in an unnoticed building near the street. Walk past, he notices a single window, always open, from which a scary melody can be heard. Every day he walks past the room, sometimes stands for hours outside and sees it through the silk curtains that float in the light breeze, hoping to catch a glimpse of his residents. Towards the end of the movie we find out how important this space really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it. <br /> <br /> The movie was cut beautifully. Not a second of the screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot. Any single frame from the movie could stand alone in an art gallery. Rutger is fantastic. He is mysterious, yet accessible. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on a life that has driven that course for better or worse. His words evoke familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. I was especially moved by a scene where he looks at some old pictures, remembers his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You get the feeling that you are in his presence as he allows you to see the world in to look at precious memories of a life approaching its end. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. Must be required viewing for all movie majors.
