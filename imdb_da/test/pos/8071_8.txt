Some will argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir's La Antena is an exercise in anachronistic invalidity; that even though the silent films that Sapir's paying tribute was on the cinema's oblique edge when made, they are outdated today, giving La Antena a meaningless inferiority. <br /> <br /> I would disagree. Sincerely. La Antena reports the conventions of the silent 21st-century technology, making it the ultimate exercise in postmodern filmmaking. The film is set in the timeless "The City Without a Voice" so-called because the citizens have been met by Mr. TV, a dictator / media bull with his hair painted on. The city resembles the first in Fritz Lang's seminal Metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. These are all expressionistic skyscrapers, television antennas and animated billboards. Citizens of the citizens are mollified by La Voz (The Voice), the only person with speech. Her face is permanently hanging off a hood (held on even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on the TV set's television network. But when Mr. TV summarizes a plan to steal the written word, gathering La Voz and the Visible Son along with a dismissed family in an attempt to return freedom of speech to the people. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Sapir has to rely on images to tell his story. There is sound, especially in the almost continuous score of Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent movie music, as well as intelligently working its way into the film's diegesis, such as car horn horning or the rhythmic ra-ta-tattoo of gunfire. And the underlying whole movie is a well-known whirring as if it were shown on an old projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of dialogue. But instead of using subtitles, Sapir's characters have shown in the frame. They are larger or smaller, fill the screen or float softly in the air, depending on what is being said. Think of a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the words are not derived from the images. It is very fortunate because La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we have seen for a long time, all captured by Cristian Cottet's lavish black and white photograph. There are the expressionist cityscapes. The hooded singer and her eyeless son. There is the city's abandoned antenna, which resembles the decaying remnants of some colossal spiders. And there is the creepy Dr. Y whose jabber mouth is displayed on a TV screen attached to his face. La Antena has been criticized for relying too much on his imagery as he glances at the allegorical depth. But again I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mind control machine shaped like a swastika or the eyeless boy, apparently crucified on a star of David, feels out of place, a little over the top of what is otherwise merely a well-made fairy tale tale. <br /> <br /> But the lack of obvious symbols (the two previous examples aside) works in favor of the movie. It allows us to design our own minds: to determine whether the political significance should be derived, to see La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media; Or just take the film at face value as a visually stunning adventure through a unique and known world. <br /> <br /> Victims of explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But really, when a movie looks as good as this, it's hard to fit. There is more imagination and artists in every setting in La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derived stick on. Making movies almost 100 years old can be in vain, but in that case Sapir can show us what's missing in today's film. He can tell us it's time for another artistic revolution. And he can be right.
