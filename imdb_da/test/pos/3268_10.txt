5 years ago, if you were to watch an Australian movie, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, dragonflies, kangaroos and koalas, and the Australians in general are represented as nitwits living in the country, say words like "cobber" and Generally, it is the classic underdog. Fortunately, Australian films have evolved over the past few years and are out modern? classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this film development, we also find Two Hands. Seen in Sydney Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss. He is the king of organized crime wearing thongs, carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami. He is evil, but genuine. As it is his æ‹·, istol mob, holding the gun to any head in a scene and then playing board games in the next. They are well respected, and if they ask you for a service, you say no. Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie guy in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on the bad side, so when Pando asks Jimmy to deliver $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. Things start to be exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy is $ 10,000 in dept for a big mob boss. From here we begin to see all the coherent stories with Jimmy and his attempt at bank robbery to recover the money, Jimmy and Alex (the love interest played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and of course the two teenagers and their new found prosperity. The concept is immersed in the narrator, Jimmy's death brother Michael, who was killed by Pando and his gang years earlier. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the stories were connected really well with a surprise that was angry to shock and stun the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br />
