Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was released in 1989 right at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film of slow deterioration of Hiroshima radiation victims an extra poignancy. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and films about the drop of the atomic bomb, but none as unique and powerful as this one. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse, which gathered information from interviews and diaries to real bomb victims, the film shows how a whole family is hit psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion. It is a frightening vision, but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. Suddenly, a dazzling light flashes and a thunderbolt is heard. Almost every building is damaged or damaged without repair. The first nuclear bomb that has ever fallen on a city is now part of the story. Survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware of the devastating aftermath of the bomb. Filmed in high contrast black and white, the story centers around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman trapped in the radioactive rain, as her boat returns to town to search for friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: A young boy with skin hanging from his body urges his brother to recognize him, an elderly man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of waste, a mother is in trouble when she cuts her child's black body. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life has changed forever. She sees her friends dying around her waiting for the inevitable outbreak of radiation disease that has already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Provided that there is only business as usual, the family refuses the bomb to have affected Yasuko. "She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Everyone forgot it, they forgot the hell of fire and went to rallies as an annual festival." I'm sick of it, "says a friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalises the tragedy, feels ashamed to be different than others and guilty of being polluted. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle try Finding her a man refuses the eligible men to marry her because of her suspicions of health, even though Shigematsu has copied her diary to prove she was not directly exposed to the bomb, the only suitor she feels good Along with is another damaged man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida) who has panic attacks every time he hears the roar of an engine. In the end, the beauty of life shows itself so fleetingly when Yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has longed After all his life, the king carp jumps into the water, playfully pretending to say beyond despair that is still joy. Unfortunately, we hear about the radio's statements by the politicians on the use of the bomb again in the Korean War. Shigematsu . "They are tightening themselves. Unjust peace is better than a war of justice. Why can't they see it? "Hopefully, Immamura's Black Rain has allowed us all to see more clearly.
