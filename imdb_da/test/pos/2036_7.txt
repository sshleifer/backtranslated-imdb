ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: "Rock Star" is the story of a nobody being driven to fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined. We've seen all of this before (in better movies), but this human story captures the rock and the role of the role with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It gives a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, "Crazy / Beautiful" director John Stockwell, depicts the core universe of memorable images - it does not explain what it is about, it shows us. "Rock Star" originally referred to as "Metal God", stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, an office manager in Pittsburgh who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead song for heavy metal rock group Steel Dragon. Although Chris is already singing for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those of the Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group gets annoyed by Chris's obsessions and gives him a boot. <br /> <br /> This destroys Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend Emily (Jennifer Aniston from TV's "Friends"). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the newly fired lead songs. In a moment Chris burns into the dizzying world of sudden stars - from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it is not as rewarding as expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the Rock Star concept. An Ohio Supply Dealer, Tim "Ripper" Owens, really replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer of the Judas Priest, after singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is enough fiction, although most of what happens must represent many other bands' experiences. The film describes the various trials about being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, fighting conditions, sexual freedom, dishonesty and the extreme measures of the producer to delight the fans and keep popularity high. <br /> <br /> I've seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies, and this is the first to have earned my love. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has made films like "Fear," "Boogie Nights" "Three Kings" and most recently Tim Burton lacks recovery "Apes Planet". I start to admire the young actress more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances and made a number of roles. "Rock Star" is his best movie to date. I can't think of many players who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and ambitions. Wahlberg really does rock star. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also lights the screen. She creates a chemically rich relationship with Chris, who induces audience participation. It's tragic about what happens to their relationship. We pay close attention to these signs. <br /> <br /> During the film concert stage, director Stephen Herek (who also instructed the "Holy Man" and the live action version of "101 Dalmatians") creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense rush and a raw unmistakable energy. The musical tracks give the film the best, most involved scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Herek is unable to maintain energy and zest throughout. At three quarters of the mark, he loses the spark as the film becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story should go to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it had previously done. In "Almost Famous", a much better movie about rock and roll, there is some interest and life in even the most sad scenes. Here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes a little too late and suddenly in history. The movie becomes a moral story that will give us a juicy destination. The filmmakers may as well stop everything, appear on the screen and say, "Now the audience is the story morally?" We understand the theme, but it is too immediate. The personal discovery of Chris' must be gradual. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this happens in the last 25 minutes of the movie, barely enough to completely destroy the fifty-five reasonably good function. "Rock Star" is not a great movie-watch "Almost Famous" if you want a remarkable movie about rock and roll but for Marky Mark it's a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
