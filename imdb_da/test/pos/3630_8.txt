The Duke is a very stupid movie - a dog becomes a duke! But it's a very funny movie. It has some of these corny pranks that many kids have movies but (luckily!) No body functions jokes that so many animal movies feel compelled to have! For the most part, only dogs are dogs and humans. . . Now people. The good guys are sympathetic and appealing. The 'evil guys' are ridiculous, and of course the pun with many jokes. But there is something worthy of this movie, because although it is stupid, it is not for all cheap laughs like "Home Alone" and others. Crocket, Simon and Copper do an excellent job of playing black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert", who dies after his beloved owner, a true Duke, dies. For the most part, they only act as dogs, no 'talking' or human emotions and attitudes. But they make stereotypical poodles, and Hubert falls for her just because she is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different image of beauty! <br /> <br /> All in all, charming, fun and enjoyable.
