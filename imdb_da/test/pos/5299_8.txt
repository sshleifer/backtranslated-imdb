I recently watched this movie and have decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to expect what you've seen before by Miyazaki. Miyazaki is known for his work at Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. good for western viewers anyway. both films were similar, but at the same time completely different. But Ponyo is a completely different type of story and animation together. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo" a fish that has a girl's face. After Ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the ocean, she finds a whole new world she never knew was out there and also new issues when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she was rescued by a five-year-old boy known as sousuke <br /> <br /> the story then follows the two of them and the sheer friendship between a boy and a fish. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel the movie was inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and at the same time "Tonari no Totoro" looks like <br /> <br /> The movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the characters a fish and a little boy, so how much do you expect to learn about them? The movie is set about what seems to be 3 days, I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie as well
