This was the movie that started the cinematic love affair <br /> <br /> between the jogging crew and Matthew Ferguson. His <br /> <br /> ability to depict RELATIVE normal letters such as Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is balanced by his straightforward <br/> <br /> handling of strange as "Sleigh." You want him to only get more roles, bigger roles and other, even more complex roles for analysis to push the boundaries of his abilities. There were <br /> <br /> four or five memorable scenes in this movie, and Matthew Ferguson stole two of them from much more experienced actors. This movie is good and it is worth looking at your own benefits, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a little extra special. His * ouevre * may finally show what Anthony Perkin's career might have been <br /> <br /> as if he hadn't been typecast as "Norman Bates" for so long <br /> <br /> the page. "Kane" is not quite as whacked-out as Norman, and far fewer <br /> <br /> people saw "Love and Human Remains" than so "Psycho", so we can hope <br /> <br /> that Ferguson will show us some hints of what Perkins MIGHT <br /> could have achieved if he had been allowed to do so.
