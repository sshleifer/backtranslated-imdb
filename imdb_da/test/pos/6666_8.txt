Kevin Spacey again chooses a winner with K-PAX, an endearing film that expresses deep revelations on human existence via the prot character's naive, yet undoubtedly wise view. It is fun to try to make 'if he is or he is not' as the plot expands and Robert Porter's character gets rid of. But some may find the end somewhat unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been any other way. My few problems with the film are about the pretty cartoon-like and over-simplified depiction of mental patients. I was surprised because the movie's plot shows a great intelligence, and I don't feel that it would have lost anything by being more honest about how people with mental problems behave. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I realize this was a movie and not a documentary, and the film itself is exquisitely shot and the story packs out at a comfortable pace. <br /> <br /> Bridges are great and Spacey delivers a sleek and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than a stranger. <br /> <br /> A great movie that lets you talk to your friends.
