Anyone who plays part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently has not received any credits. Too bad. <br /> <br /> All Dead End Kids do their job beautifully in this 1939 post. It's strange to see them in a western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I think it should be Bowery). They even show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite right now is in the battle scene near the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his dance film expertise when John Garfield changes his feet, and as we look at it, the camera moves up to his face. I don't want to give away why or when, but the appearance of his face at that time probably took the 1939 audience on foot in the theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank was not making movies, so maybe Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now let me tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you see the movie, see the grandmother's hands. May Robson do his part well. She seems to have hands that walk a little. In a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's (John Garfield) dressing room, see where she touches the chained John Garfield while wearing only his suitcases. <br /> <br /> A great ending. Lots of wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> Best line can be at the gas station, "... eight gallons, it's a dollar twenty-eight ..." Tom Willett
