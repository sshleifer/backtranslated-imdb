It is fantastic! A sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deception. <br /> <br /> The story is carefully and ingeniously constructed. It's really a perfect blend: It's all from excitement to humor, and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is constructed as a puzzle piece that is piece by piece and solves the story ... For that viewer there is plenty of surprises to the end !! I also had a small impression that the director has been inspired by some Hitchcock work. I've also seen movies before where you see the same event happening from different angles, but this movie goes beyond it. In this movie, everything is based on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and reappears in another location. Every actor in history has his own secret, and we will realize it in a way that helps to assemble the puzzle .... I especially loved the dark humor scenes ... which made laughing the whole theater .... This movies are a must see for everyone!
