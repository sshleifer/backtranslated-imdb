In a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it is sign, one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher Dizzy Dean. He was so colorful a personality he was probably chosen for the Baseball Hall of Fame on the strength of it as opposed to his pitching statistics. After part of the dean history is the early end of his career. In St. Louis's Dan Dailey Pride successfully captures Dizzy Dean, at least the dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember him pitching, but I remember him sending the Baseball Game of the Week in the 1960s. For it is also part of the dean history, to be a groundbreaking radio and TV television. Now there are ads in the Hall of Fame, there is no doubt. Dizzy belongs there. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper's children who had very little schooling but a great talent for throwing a baseball at dazzling speed. In fact, he had a younger brother Paul Dean who was quite a good pitcher himself. Richard Crenna plays Paul in this movie and it is one of his earliest film roles. Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retreat ready whose career was also cut by injuries. Because of that, Crenna is not much to work with. During the dancers' flourish, sports writers tried to set Daffy's nickname on Paul, but it never took. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru takes a break from playing, western gals in gingham dresses and corsets are first class as the clever, patient and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while playing for Houston in the Texas League . <br /> <br /> In 1937, All Star Game started Dizzy for the National League. On the way to Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was hit on the foot by driving on a line. When he refused to listen to medical care, the dean returned to pitch too soon. He had broken a big toe and put too much on his arm. He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept it is part of the story. <br /> <br /> Had he had a career from ten to fifteen years, who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up. Dean was the next to last pot to win 30 games in 1934, and after Denny McLain (who was a character himself) made it in 1968, it hasn't happened since. <br /> <br /> The Dean entered the radio and while he was not the first former player to enter the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. He started broadcasting for the second St. Louis teams, Browns and Browns were a beautiful miserable team with not much to cheer about. The Dean became a star attraction there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of dean history is the trouble he came into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air. It is part of the story I do not go into, but in the film it is dealt with tact and humility, and your eyes can be dampened if you have the sentimental. A fine baseball movie, a real tribute to an American success story.
