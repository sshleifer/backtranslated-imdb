Inherited this from my xs dvd collection when he left with my best friend (said enough), saw it one night as there was nothing on telly (nothing new on it) and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you hardly have any budget, no faces you know or have even seen before), the accents were a bit thick to my taste, but after a worrying start (a little too close to home in my case) it started to grow on me. Apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything, I found the movie through uplifting, very real natural performances throughout the left, and I wanted more from an end that came suddenly too fast. Highly recommended!
