Winning 26 of the 28 prizes it was nominated for is no doubt that this movie will be one of the best of 2007. It was made with non-professionals trained to act and dances make it much more special. <br /> <br /> It's not a Bollywood production, but it's about art. A lower throwing girl wants to sing and dance. She wants to move up in society, but there is a limit. Everyone cannot be a President in India, a caste system, and the narrow minds will not allow it to be violated. <br /> <br /> Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) finishes school at. 15 and goes to work for the landlady (Urmila Dammannagari), who was once a successful dancer. After a while, the animals work, she is taught to sing and dance. The film is strikingly beautiful with rich colors. That's great what can be done with $ 20,000, as this movie was a masterpiece for the author's director. The landlady's son (Karan Singh) returns from America to run for office and gets hit by the girl. But she is lower caste and can only be a ship for her desire. Things are no better at home when her father drinks and eats and steals his money. She ends up getting pregnant and has to sell the baby to the hostess. <br /> <br /> Eventually she never rises over her throw, but the story was fascinating and the actor was really good.
