Family Guy must be my very first favorite cartoon. It is definitely the funniest TV show ever made and is better than The Simpsons. I've never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life. The things that make the show so fun are the plot, characters and themes that are dealt with in the show. There are very few themes that have not been addressed at Family Guy. I've seen almost every episode of the Family Guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very fun and is the best character of the show. My other favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV show. I hope this show never ends because it's a comic genius! 10.10
