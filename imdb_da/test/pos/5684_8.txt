So well made, no CGI crap. Has anyone else been on the "Jumping Crocs" tour of Darwin's Adelaide River before? Black water was way realistic; Rogue was a little cringeworthy. <br /> <br /> Thought the blonde chick was great in it - hasn't really seen her before. And the other chicken is a treasure, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> V. thrilling - I would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flicks. Get the hole Aussie stuff down pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys, as well. <br /> <br /> Loved it!
