"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the United States as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and I think it is better - than most films about poor people who leave Europe and come to the United States. The film begins with scenes in a poor rural area in Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a stony island, but you don't understand the reality of this sentence until you see the first half hour of "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The middle part of the movie is dedicated to the long journey to the United States. Most immigration films show us ten minutes that third-class people become seasick and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we get a feel for life underneath the deck and it's not charming. (Neither do we see the Statue of Liberty.) Finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then the immigrants go through New York's Lower East Side. Not here - Ellis Island experience occupies about a third of the footage. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is excellent as Salvatore Mancuso, bringing her two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious English woman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There is some weird hand in the movie, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there, but I couldn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already pointed out that this movie will be better seen in a theater than on DVD. Still, big screen or small screen, it's worth finding out.
