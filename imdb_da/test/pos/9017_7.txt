In England, we often feel very attached to British movies that we like, as we are so used to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where Virtual Sexuality is set, I felt a strong emotional connection to it. The characters of Virtual Sexuality, especially females, are exactly what British teens are like, I felt I was almost in the movie. Immediately associated with Alex's character from the movie, his shame is quite common with most British teenage boys, especially around girls. Virtual sexuality made me feel really good, as it is one of the only British films that is not about gangsters or middle class, but about the people who see the movie's average teens. The Americans would not really feel the emotional attachment, but any British teenager would see it. Anyone from London will recognize parts of the city from the movie, it certainly has got a special place in my video box!
