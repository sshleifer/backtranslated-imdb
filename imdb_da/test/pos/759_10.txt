I had to get this movie because it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I fell in love with this movie. You could see the chemistry between Walters and Grint as they also worked together on Harry Potter movies. The woman who plays her indulgent, fair mother had really convinced me, and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a good job playing the role. I only wish we could have seen the actual sex scene or more of it. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination about how it went down. (snickers) I totally believed the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a good job and it's nice to see that he is making movies outside of Harry Potter, even though I absolutely love him as Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a good job and I hope Rupert continues to trade outside of Harry Potter to expand his abilities!
