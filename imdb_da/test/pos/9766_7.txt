I drove to the library to check out these miniseries after just finishing listening to the marvelous "talking books" shortened version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really very good, but it stumbled right in the second half. The relationship with the manager is overplayed and conflicts have been inserted between Jean and Joe, not found in Shute's history, in my opinion, as they greatly diminish the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find out that the wonderful Bryan Brown's Joe seemed very scary and far less appealing than the man in the book, but Helen Morse Jean was really quite good. I think they would have made this a 10-hour miniseries to properly develop the outback story. But all that said, I saw all the time for more or less once and appreciated its benefits as I constantly wanted someone to make a smaller soapy water.
