The only reason the Duke is Tops, one of several "race movies" made in the segregation times, would be worth noting today, because it made the movie debut of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to be able to branch out in the big time. Davis must, however, fake having taken the money for his services in front of her, so she will not be sorry to have done so. Then he joins Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical tests across the South. Meanwhile, her new New York producers have been bombing a lot of time because they made her the whole show instead of just the special act. Davis finds out the radio and offers his services as a producer and bandleader to bring his lineup of other special acts, many of which make their one of their few or only movie appearances here, for his chance at the great time with Ethel next to Hi M Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicians during this time, the fact that this was made for a particular audience became one of the more fascinating features I've seen during this black story month. Mrs. Horne's song is on good display here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. Among other supporting players, there is unconfirmed, according to IMDb, the appearance of Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie. It's a wonderful life and sister of Amanda Randolph, as I am in the musical map The Black Network, as the woman with sciatica who complains not to be cured after taking Doc's medicine before Duke explains it is for the feet! And as a long-standing Louisiana resident, I would like to note two players from this movie: Joel Fluelle from Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So for just Lena Horne alone, The Duke Tops is worth seeing at least once.
