I love this movie. It was done just before the LA punk scene changed to worse. It keeps the mood and attitude of the time and place perfect. I feel really lucky to have been present at the recording of four of the bands at Fleetwood that night. The only part that doesn't fit well is the sections with Catholic discipline and their socio-political commentary. I didn't see too many people who were at all. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I experienced a lot; people who deal with hard life or take a swing in the music industry and / or miserable hippies. I don't think I've seen a documentary that captures so authentic and personal that the subject is covered.
