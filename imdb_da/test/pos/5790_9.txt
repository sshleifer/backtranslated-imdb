This documentary was my first introduction to Peak Oil theory. A fascinating concept that has many scary consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil discharge would come as soon as it literally took the breath. This film will probably open your eyes to how strongly the American lifestyle relies on "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. Many topics are common sense, and they do not go into a great depth of any of them. But you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. Interviews with authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this movie is meant to scare people. It's just meant to inform people what to expect in the years to come, and perhaps to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100 miles to work and leaving your lights all day long. <br /> <br /> Having watched this movie I was no longer able to look at cars and buses that zoomed completely together. Great documentary, everyone should see it.
