It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Surely it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart. Really, the legend of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say they "play". No, they live as if it happened to them. Note the smile that faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the last scene! <br /> <br /> Really, I'm still under the impression of that movie. It is very difficult, even impossible, to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson did), the impact would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it to "ONE FLEW OVER CUCKOO'S NEXT". I also like this movie (and the novel itself is also good), but after Frederikson's film it seems simple. (The same difference I discovered after I watched the movie "American History X" and "ROMPER STOMPS" - the latter being deeper). I think Milos Forman showed only the material's point of view of the problem. You see it, so you say yes, it's a good movie, I like him, I don't like her, and that's it. But "angels" give you a broad base to think. There are no bad and good boys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave the way they do. As one of the patient's girlfriend. Of course, she is young and pregnant and it is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic, but her exfriends feelings and emotional experiences are even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why ask him what has he done? Aren't you crazy to ask yourself? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it is even fun when these people talk to each other. They say genius stuff! There are many things I would like to say about this movie, but I'm not so good at English. But I'm sure those of you who have seen the movie understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
