I think this is a heart-dragging movie. Richard Donner (director of the top grossing movie "Superman") had done a good job in managing this movie. Some of the victories were good, and several were horrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by The King (Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane attacked the King, which meant he paid for what he had done for Bobby. /> <br /> Elijah Wood, portrayed a good role in this movie, he dreamed the memorable scene that he took the buffalo's advice that Bobby was abused. Lorraine Bracco (Pre-Sopran) had portrayed an impressive role. br /> <br /> I give this movie *** out of four !!!
