A city in Japan is taken over by a terrible brutal abstract form: the spiral. It becomes a theme in everything from animals to clouds to humans and twisting them mentally and literally. This film shows that it happens to several groups of people. Some demonic possessions are implied, but nothing is certain, except that the best game is to get the heel out of the way. The film goes really well from the normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (wandering death). As an enchanted American horror movie fan, it was just what I needed. Perhaps it was just the news of another culture film, but it seemed to have a very original progression, set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese can think "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral" I am told) is old now, but it was great for me because I am used to being monster / alien / virus / disaster / evil movie. In an American movie, you know who is going to die (the annoying / ugly / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (children / heroine / dogs / cats / nice guys). It's not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight evil or how it would end. It also had this really new (but probably typical Japanese) color lacquered Pacific Northwest style cloudy day thing going, which was a fresh visual effect for me. The horrible moments were seriously scary and rely on a little gore, but mostly just impossible excessive facial expressions (think The Ring) and body manipulations. This should be one of the big ones up there with even original ideas like the first nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
