For anyone interested I have managed to get it on DVD from Ebay (haven't received it yet - any day now). I've been desperate to get it myself, even though it's a VHS quality put on a DVD I don't mind. So for anyone interested come in contact with me and maybe I can help you. To be honest, it is ridiculous to have to wait nearly 7 years to see it again, but boy it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> All my work colleagues are desperate to see it too. <br /> <br /> Whatever I send later about the quality. <br /> <br /> Just do it a search on Ebay if you want it. It is there to buy
