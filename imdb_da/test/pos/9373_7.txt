Crossfire (1947) Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Movie It's hard to go wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan all together as the three male leaders, and with director Edward Dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn. It is reason enough to see it once and even twice. You may need a different look to fully capture the plot as explained (too much) or shown in flashback (too much) because it is a little complicated without good reason. But it makes sense in general and we see early (prematurely) who the blame is and even why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with the short quips, the post-war movies are dramatic, the social message, the anti-Semitic point of it all. It only borders on preachy once or twice, and it is such a clear good point to get us to see that it is being approved and waiting for the plot and the dramatic action that takes the lead. As they do, especially Young, who is an excellent laconic and patient detective, and Ryan who is strange in a credible and weird way (Ryan is good at it, his typecasting is reasonable). Mitchum mostly plays an emigrated version of what he is famous for, and the fourth well-known actor, Gloria Grahame, is a large, short-lived presence, though not readily available. Although the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, which both grow in power as we go, it is really easy to see just for lighting, camera work and acting, including the classic battle scene that opens the first few seconds of film, all with shadows. <br /> <br /> The soldiers are very deliberate, and it might be something people at that time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as anti-Semitism. The shake-shocked soldier did helpless (but still inherent), the modest youth without confidence (but also capable of) and the tired but outgoing veteran are all there. And of course it is the angry, violent soldier who is also a product of the war. This last is also a society's responsibility - even the army is trying to cope with the injustices here, not just because they are criminals, but because they derive from the wear and tear of a long awful war. <br /> <br /> The audience could get more, than now, really, but it is there to appreciate yet.
