I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlbergs. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script left something to be desired, but the film's performances created it. There were a few moments when the vision of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a documentary. But I'm going out. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent as he plays credibly with an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that makes you not only believe in him but also makes you really interested in his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who has not impressed me in film until this point, is surprisingly good as a boyfriend / manager. She shows more real feelings than I have seen in her last few films combined. <br /> <br /> But above all, it is the music in this movie that really draws you. Peppered with some 80's tunes (let's see it - Bon Jovi would have 80s music fans rocking in their seat), the film really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance of them. <br /> <br /> I'm planning to watch this movie again, but first I want to hurry up and buy the soundtrack!
