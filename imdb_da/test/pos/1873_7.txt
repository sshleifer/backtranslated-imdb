It's been years of cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but he's finally here - and what a great piece of entertainment it is! Looking at the plot; It sounds like two things. A great base for a very stupid B movie and a shameless excuse for Bruce Campbell for what he does best - Evil Dead II style slapstick humor, and this movie delivers on both sides. The man with the screaming brain is cartoon nonsense all the way through - but there are some really good scenes and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directs, produces and stars in this movie - and while it's not quite Citizen Kane, it must be said that this is a performance for the man most famous for fighting for himself in a forest hut. The reason follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. However, the trip goes wrong when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up being dead; thanks to the same woman. Food scientist Stacy Keach is ready to merge Cole and the taxi driver's brains into one; and we have a cult girl on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is so entertaining and has a few laughs; But when the primary point has been made, the movie really captures. Bruce makes the best use of the scenario in all kinds of stupid situations, from changing his clothes in a waste tray to determining (with the taxi driver in his brain) what to eat in a restaurant. The humor is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who has had the evil death II (who should be someone who has seen it) will undoubtedly enjoy this as well. It feels like Campbell is playing a little too much with this whole project, but if you've voted in and don't see Bruce do what he does best, disappointment will arise. In addition, there is no respect for the man; but he has never been the actor with the greatest selection. Despite being very fun; The movie is not great as it gets a little too silly at times; and there's a whole lot of plot with a robot that I didn't like; But in general, The Man With the Screaming Brain is a movie that we unfortunately do not see too much of today. The movie is an all-out, no team is blocked, B-movie; and it deserves respect for it if nothing else.
