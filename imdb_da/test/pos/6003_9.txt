I remember when this NBC mini-series aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I would check some adjustments. Didn't expect much from a TV mini series, but now I might have to check out a little more. This is actually excellent and the best possible movie version that could be made. The author Simon Moore, who wrote the teleplay to the original Traffic mini series on which the Soderberg film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative story that helps the story flow very smoothly: it hits Gulliver's fairy tale as flashbacks with the actual story begin then Gulliver first returns home (everything has happened on a journey). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is so wildly apparent when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, welcomes him back to his home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, James Fox, who has design at Steenburgen. Gulliver only seems disturbed at first, but when he begins to tell stories of small people, it's all the evidence Fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. All four Gullivers journeys are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this is done on film). I love the way his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gullivers little son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the Liliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine tissue over him and remind him of the Brogding nuns, and the doctors' scientific studies remind him of the passionate experiments and theories of the laputans and academics. Finally, he is reminded of Houyhnhnms and Yahoos when he is put to the test. Cast of this stuff is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest mistake of the miniseries is that the play is really uneven. You have all these fine actors, but the smaller characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes by L.A. Law, but it's not going well in a costume drama. Ted Danson is not very big, even though he has a few sequences where he excels. It is probably better that he did not try one, but all other characters in the film speak in an English accent. Steenburgen is actually quite good at it, and is quite good overall. Another mistake the series has is that the fairy tales happen a little too fast. It is not credible that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as claimed. But in general, it takes Swift's tone and purpose very well, while with its structure it adds a new emotional level.
