Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman movie and Beetlejuice brings the world to Batman's successor, which exceeds the original in more ways than one. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads in history, and penguins work the same way the joker worked in the original. The sets are amazing and immaculate. Gotham City has so many dark alleys that you could never know what's happening at some point. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to be lapsing and then not recovering at the moment. Tim Burton's direction brings superhero movies to a new world. Beats all the super movies and the other Batman movies a mile. Although the new Batman begins, it has a bite that lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
