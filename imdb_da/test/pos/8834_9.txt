It was clear that the answers here were written many years after the movie was released and cannot be taken in context. Back in 1980 in Post Work England, this movie was gentle fun. We were delighted with something to laugh about, and Rising Damp, with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social team, was one of the best British sitcoms of its time, if not ever. It hit a chord in almost everyone, and in true British fashion we laughed Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to do with this kind of humor because self-mutilation was not entertaining for our overseas cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of England's finest actors, on stage, on television and in movies. His dedication and professionalism was something else. Richard Beckinsale, though young, was a perfect comedian foil for Rossiter and should, with all rights, be classified as an absolutely fantastic time. Had he not been so young, I'm sure he would now be classified as one of Britain's largest comedy actors. Frances De la Tour found her finest TV moment in Rising Damp and for me never quantified his undoubted ability with additional roles. If you did not watch the movie at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment simply because you cannot understand why it was fun, the humor of the moment.
