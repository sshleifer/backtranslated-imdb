During the last century, there has been much progress in gender equality, but not so much in the film world. I'm not talking about what's going on behind the camera, I refer to taste from the audience. The idea of ​​a "chick girl" is alive and well today, while there is still plenty of action and horror movies that primarily appeal to men. Sure there are men and women enjoying the movies that fall outside their typical demographic, but there aren't many movies that have appeals across the board. Hitch, the latest Will Smith vehicle, is trying to change this trend by being a chicken spider throwing a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> Smith stars in Hitch as the title character, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a "date doctor" who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully achieving their goal of going out with the woman of their dreams, but because of a bad college experience, Hitch is even a sullied on the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly distinct lines of history. Hitch's latest case is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heirs of Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has doubts about Albert's chances, but if his clients want to be sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets the gossip collective Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is immediately attracted to this strong woman. Doctor's doctor, however, does not seem to follow his own counsel to persecute Sara. Things become even more complicated when Sara's job leads her to investigate the relationship between auditor and heirs. Will Hitch be able to balance her privacy and job? And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you are a true movie fan then there has been at least once in your life having complained about the Hollywood film factory's redundancy and shouting for something new and original. Well, Hitch's not that movie. But most movie fans will also admit that a formula film can occasionally only work at an entertainment level. Hitch qualifies as that movie.
