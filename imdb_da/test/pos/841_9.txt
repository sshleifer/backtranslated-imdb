"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of mass lion. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entrances, it is impressively photographed, lurid enthusiastic and populated with a villain's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, director of the first installment, returns to this surreal sculpture, beginning with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm of a policeman, she is handcuffed and flying into the Tokyo subway with the arm still swinging from the wrist . She takes refuge in a red light district where she turns to a prostitute who has seen incestuous intercourse with her brother (who ends up impregnating her). Scorpion's desire to protect this unlucky woman ultimately reveals his identity, and the whole hell breaks loose. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked in a bizarre bird cage in the villain. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally moving film. It is superior to the first three Scorpion movies and has a great scene after another. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
