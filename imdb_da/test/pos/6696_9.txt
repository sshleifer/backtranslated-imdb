As with some of the best movies and series, I stumble across it quite accidentally. It was late, a storm was in full force outside, and I was sitting comfortably on the sofa as I flew past a channel that was just showing one of the episodes. I was only going to watch for a few minutes while waiting for the advertisements to finish on another channel before switching back to some sitcom. About an hour and a half later I remembered my decision and was so glad I didn't. Needless to say, I made sure I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah has been brilliant in almost everything I've seen him, and he doesn't even get out of here. All other cast members also do a stellar work. My personal favorite (except John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side to this series is the limited amount of episodes. Only 8 with JH himself and an extra 1 with another. I would love to see McCallum back on the screen even though it should be with JH!
