I am a happily married 49-year-old woman who just happens to kill this movie. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis' character is strong, smart and kicking .... I thought she did an excellent (it's an understatement) job in this movie. I'm not really big on action movies, but I thought it was soooooooo sexy and entertaining. <Br /> <br /> She is my alter-ego ............. when she starts putting the assault rifle together in the old hotel room .......... ... ......... I got chills ............... she did as if she knew what she was doing .......... ... that was one of my favorite things in that movie ........ I think she deserved an Oscar for her acting and physical roles ....... <br /> < br /> I must have 'CHARLY' tattooed on my back .............. I am one of those girls who will never be a VICTIM ........ .............. I am like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh in secret ........ and am not that oh so sexy?)
