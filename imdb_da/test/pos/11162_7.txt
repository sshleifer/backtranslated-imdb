Hi, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men participating in a speed dating event, each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite. A good idea to make a movie out of these conversations. And even better: it works very, very well! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized, without falling into the cliché, something that is unusual for German films, remember: All these years, we Germans were plagued with stupid geographical comedies like "Workaholic" or "Stadtgespräch" . <br /> <br /> But now it's time for young German directors to do their own thing and risk producing movies that are entertaining and fun and intelligent and sensitive at the same time. The time of the "shop" is also good: Although it presents mainly dialogue, it keeps the excitement and interest. After a while, you will be curious to see how this man and that woman would do. Some of the participants later appear for a two-part, it's fun to see them interacting together in the "reality". Of course, the film has some disadvantages: it's not very cinematic (but can such a movie be?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We have some wonderful actors here. Imagine this: Everyone is still quite unknown even here in Germany (most of them are derived from Munich or Bavarian theater scene). But I predict that out of the 18 main players, at least 11 will soon be very well known in the film and TV scene above. It is great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, here is an overview of all 18 actors: (spoilers!) Sebastian Weber: Silent waters are deep! Remember his "Flower garden" monologue, you can win every woman's heart with this. Anna Böger: A hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth, you can't help laughing and feeling good. Listen how she says "asshole" and call the pink shirt guy a "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: "Bürscherl" above is fun to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many guys around. His appearance reminded me of Flo Weber from "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her "want kids" scene is a classic. A great actress whom we will hear again without a doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Now is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is not a method that works. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "beautiful" woman in the circle. Julia used to play theater in my home town, kudos! I think she will look in many TV shows coming. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary guy finally captures the sweetest and most conventional woman. Want to share a taxi with this guy? Kathrin von Steinburg: She gave a fantastic performance in "Tatort" last year. Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. Watch her beautiful face and hear her dirty grin. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know these "write down everything" guys back from school. I'm not sure if the hot blonde got his allergic reaction because of him or his cat. Matthias' portrayal of such a chicken is excellent. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: The son-in-law of my ex-girl friend was the same talker as her. The day I met her was the only day of my life, I needed sedatives, so bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "nice and desperate guy" in the circle. The Limp'sel has a comic talent that is far better than most so-called "comedians" on television. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: Victims of Sebastian's "flower garden" metaphor. Lisa's face is fun and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "great" man in the circle. No wonder he finally catches Julia. These two really fit together. I think he's going to look in many TV shows coming. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "cute, conventional" woman. I hope she will not be underestimated: Julia's face changes from naive to evil to furious good! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: "Nature boy" from Partenkirchen likes to cook, eat? and good sex. See the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU politician South on stage! Anja Klawun: "The bargain girl" has some good moments, but asks your excuse, failing (like most actors) to play one full on the screen. <br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: Plays the arrogant and narcissistic guy. Could not believe that this very actor owns two art theaters in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Plays the girl who sleeps with every man around. I am sure many male visitors will go to her. I've heard that she can also do dramatic roles so I'm curious.
