Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie seems strange, but it is entertaining all the same. It is a well done parody of what became a classic silent film, and it exhibits Stan's talents very well. While his photos with Oliver Hardy were great, these early solo efforts give you an idea of ​​how skilled he was on his craft, and how great he might have been, he continued in the Keaton and Chaplin tradition as his own star alone. The dance sequence with his real wife in the cafe scene is the best part of the picture, and has some beautiful fun things to go with Laurel's outstanding dance steps. And the bullfight is a gem, as even the bull takes a chat. And I like the irony of the scene where he is buried in hats and comes up wearing his familiar Laurel and Hardy bowler hat. As much as I love Laurel and the Hardy team and feel that there was never a fun comedy doo on the screen under their prime, it's nice to see them on their own once in a while (check out the COMBATING KENTUCKIAN that Hardy did with the Duke as another fine example.)
