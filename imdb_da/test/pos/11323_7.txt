The BBC and HBO joined forces to create "Dirty War", a 90-minute television film about a terrorist "dirty bomb" attack in London. The film quickly comes to business as it packs both the terrorist and the government's anti-terrorist action into the film, leaving a small space for human interest subplots. On the terrorist side, we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials for mounting to exposure to detonation. On the government side, PR and training exercises are seen, the collection and analysis of intelligence, interdiction, post-detonation response and follow-up. The film also gives a sense of how the Al-Qaeda type of terror cells are organized, radical Islamic terrorism and terrorist strategies. A kind of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "Dirty War" will answer many questions that lurk in the minds of a public that becomes more aware of this insidious threat. (B)
