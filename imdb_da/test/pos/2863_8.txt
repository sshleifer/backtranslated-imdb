My taste in movies continues to amaze me and probably disturb readers of my reviews, but for each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy screams, slasher flicks and See No Evil happen to be exactly that and more !! I think the biggest mistake that producers and filmmakers have made of this movie is that they hype it as a WWE movie and "starring" KANE. WWE can have a great sequel, but it is a very, very specific group that follows the incredibly cheesy and (sorry people) kind of trailer park "sport" and those who don't love it HAD IT !! It would get them to remove an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in cuddling to see. Seeing No Evil doesn't break new horror scene, it's just about to typically play scary with some of the top, horrible bloody scenes that frankly make the screen crawl. They really drive it home and go for free violence just cause. There is no psychological aspect, though it is being chased by this monster, has some fear elements to it. <br /> <br /> KANE (the wrestler) also known as Glen Jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original killer, and even his killer does not really go to the unique or original with the great exception to choke a girl to death by forcing her to swallow her cell phone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is legitimately huge !! He stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor all play the typical group of "Believe they are invincible" partying teens who unconditionally fall victim to serial killer. The story is that, unlike a month from their detention for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service" by dissolving it. Turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and removes the eyes of his victims to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a scum bag, which eventually becomes quite a kind of self-saving ex-girlfriend, which he used to turn on. The rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well, but it is not a great variety of working ability. Unfortunately, the porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, doing a good job together strikes the modern slasher together. He even goes into a bit of history with the killer, and although his back story is not unique either, it is actually a little outdated, it is still interesting enough. And in the few shots where the filmmaker actually looks through the killer's eyes, it is interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted as he does. He throws in the mandatory soft core naked shots, and the grotesque, blood-woven scenes, and shifts everything into a notch. It fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself it is entertaining. Kane's serial killer is horrific and he steals them all with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. The movie is panned and crapped, and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty wild, but isn't it? It's a horror movie, and I thought it was exactly what it was supposed to be. It made me jump, it made me scratch, it even made me turn away on several parts ... impressive of any standard. It's entertaining, with a decent story and lots of set up for serialization See No Evil until the 15th Deposit if they wanted it and I say, bring it on !! It's true that the movie is full of plot holes, ridiculous details, but the deadly gore and horror over rides everything. It all comes down to you love horror movies ?? Really love them ?? If so, then you think it's a great slasher ... if not ... you'll hate it ... clean and simple. 8.5 / 10
