I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best characters on the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love it when he worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda hit the crap out of a guy. It was fun. Nikki Cox is also good and she has good chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was fantastic in her guest role. I wish they hadn't killed her. The show has a great cast with no bad actors, which is not something you often see on television. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She should have got an Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame that the show was canceled
