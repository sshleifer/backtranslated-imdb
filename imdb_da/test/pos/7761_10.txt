Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very highly rated anime in almost every review page you find on the internet. So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you get past the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and very strange world. A very well designed, perfectly animated world, that is. <br /> <br /> I can't tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'm just saying it's a high school comedy ... and yet it's not. I can't really say what it's all about. Really, I'm a HUGE anime fan, and I have about 50 full series, and I'm not talking when I say it, even though I'm not finished seeing Haruhi Suzumiya, it's actually very high in my personal collection. I fell in love at first sight with this one, and I assure you that at least you will not care about its irresistible charm. Believe me, I don't go around and give a 10 to everything I see.
