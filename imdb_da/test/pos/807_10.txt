Excellent work around especially by the actor, who also played the wife Gerda (Claire Price), of course as David Suchet. I've really found out whodunit, but it's next to that point. The end, which I will not reveal (someone describes it on the board in response to others' questions, if you are interested.) I really felt sorry. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, I thought these really well rounded. <br /> <br /> The pacing of the story was good, and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I believe to be a well-known Dr. Watson.)) as her husband.
