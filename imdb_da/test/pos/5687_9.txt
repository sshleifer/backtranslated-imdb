This film is about doing something special, it also does not seem to do certain things. In short, it has a certain predictive path - dealing with the idea of ​​meeting death (with very few choices and all those bad) as serious and real rather than something casual or entertaining. In pursuit of this realism, it has omitted certain conventions such as obvious character arches and hooks. It's not about the characters as much as about the human condition. Never mind what the actors would do ... what would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open water may have been the starting point for this movie, but it goes much further. Unlike the movie, it does not eventually cheat the audience when you find out that there are no sharks to talk about at all. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. It also has good production values, given what these highly resourceful filmmakers had to work with. And, unlike the other movie, it has some exciting and brilliant unfolding actions on its climax. And let's not forget, let's say "dazzling", the screen's presence of its youngest star. She may turn out to be quite a discovery.
