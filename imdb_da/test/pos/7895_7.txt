"Joe" is one of those movies where even though you think it can go smoothly, you end up. I can't come up with an analogy. It showed not only that America's long-standing idea of ​​unity was much, but also the various aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate flower child while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a pure-cut executive. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's girlfriend. In the immediate succession, Bill becomes acquainted with Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right-wing, refined racist work stiff. As a result, the two will end up more and more with the hippies, which Bill finds unpleasant, and Joe's honor. But in the end everything has dead serious consequences. True, some parts of the movie are a bit dated, but it is a good compilation of America's two sides during the Vietnam War. And be sure the remaining effects of everything that will probably never go away.
