Although I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but it is quite good. I liked music and dancing and the end of how Gene got the girl. My favorite part is undoubtedly the dance of the gene with its alter ego. I love to see two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It's a movie that I think everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. So you haven't seen it go out to find it today! I'm sure everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend who has this movie in their collection. Then go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!
