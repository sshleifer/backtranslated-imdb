This series has recently been crawled, and excerpts can be seen, at least within the UK, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html Presumably there is some hope that The series may eventually become more widely available. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which had a similar casting, and which has been available for cable television or at least in need of the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are completely different in dramaturgy; WARS consolidates the games through extensive rewriting and changing scenes; A kingdom follows Shakespeare closer. Both series enjoy integrated casting.
