Junior college and high school teachers will find "The Cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to "Huckleberry Finn" or as an independent lesson. Although AIDS must be the main theme, the strong sup text of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a strong message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered on the symbolism of tennis shoes are particularly effective. I also suggest directed discussion on how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.
