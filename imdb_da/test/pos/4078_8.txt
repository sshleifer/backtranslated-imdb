I totally hate the idea of ​​making TV movies. For me, TVM usually involves Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat illness done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesn't need tissues that need insulin. So, when DEADLY VOYAGE a made for television movies from BBC and HBO based on a true story, I remembered vaguely from a couple of years that had previously come up on the TV schedules, I sat down and waited to become boring meaningless. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No strike the last sentence, I was not surprised that I was shocked. Here is a TVM that grabbed you tighter than a big white shark. In fact, bad VOYAGE does not deserve to be referred to the TV schedules, it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood movie company because of its absolutely frightening performance and what's more - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - absolutely true br /> <br /> For those who don't know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILS PLATED !!!!! sometime in the early 90s, a bunch of Africans on a Ukrainian cargo ship tied to France to work there. Of course, it was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the carrier's crew had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants on their ship from a previous journey and did not want to get any further in problems with maritime and immigration authorities the murder of the Africans after discovering them hiding in the team. All but one African, Kingsley Ofusu, who is able to escape from the shooting area but who is trying to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting and France is still several days away. <br /> <br /> Just writing the paragraph above reminds you of how good DEADLY VOYAGE is. What a remarkable story and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - completely true. It is very well written, directed and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee (why isn't that guy a big name star?), And most of all it's an exciting claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I still remember alive six years after seen it for the only time. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. But you have to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blocks that came around at the same time? Oh, I just had a disturbing mindset about Jerry Bruickhiemer making a remake with Tony Scott, and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing Pertwee's role, massive artistic license taken with events, etc. Let's be bad VOYAGE a superlative TVM instead of a bad blockbuster
