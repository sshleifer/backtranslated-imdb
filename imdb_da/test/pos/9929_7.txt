Often Argento's last "big" movie, this entry into the Giallo cannon is undoubtedly better than any Argento movie that has followed it (although I haven't seen "Tears Mother" yet), but to call it its last "Big" movies can stretch it a little. <br /> <br /> The thriving and stylistic flowering - characteristic of all Argento movies - is actually present, with some of his excitement sequences ranked with his best (the "peephole" sequence is particularly memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's movie is outstanding (the fluorescent lamp is beautiful). <br /> <br /> But the story - which is hit and miss in all Argento's films - is missing here. In fact, there is a strong sense of mystery and intrigue, but plotted resorts to what are essentially a series of murder sequences where one follows the other and leaves no real time to fully construct a true, focused mystery to be solved. All this results in a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic, as the film did not invest enough interest to make us really care. Whatever it is recommended, it is simply due to the masterful direction and the beautiful imagery that Argento evokes. I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argento's film, however (for that I would recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you have had it or even some giallo, then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire.
