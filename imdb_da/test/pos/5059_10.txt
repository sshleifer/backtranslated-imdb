We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year for the last 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie films for any movie anytime at no cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they are going to write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of pleasure, that's good enough for us! We never listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Good enough about it. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep heads the NSC in the movie, "USA torture doesn't say", it made a big laugh at this movie. It is, of course, a lie that the Bush administration has denied again and again. It's a very good movie, and it's scary in what they can do for us as we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "snatch" you everywhere and tell someone they did. In this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. He is of course like you or me. And then they take him to a secret location outside the United States to torture and waterboard him. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well acted by Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
