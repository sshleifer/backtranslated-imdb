I cannot comment on the accuracy of this production, historically or literally, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, Ilona Sekacz's work is truly persistent. For twenty years, I am still moved by the joking issues in this production and returning to it often. History surrounds Catherine Moreland's entry into society. Something awkward and obsessed with an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine catered to Bath in the company of Mrs Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, the seat of the formidable (and slightly economically challenged) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there are wealth. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction interferes with family funding, dispute is inevitable. This combined with Catherine's lively imagination causes her to fear her safety. Her possible departure is astonished by accusations and charges of fraud and passion. <br /> <br /> However, the attraction between Catherine and Henry stands for these trials. He returns to give a good ending. This last scene is especially convincing, given Ilona Sekacz's random music. <br /> <br /> It may well be a "bad" production from the purists' point of view, flashy costumes and appalling performances that don't resist, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.
