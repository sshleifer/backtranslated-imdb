(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this movie surreal, the term fits badly here. To quote from the Encyclopedia Britannica, it is surreal: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or unnoticed imagery": You do not have to explain the imaginative, how many ways a nice 10-year-old boy is looking for his happiness in the driver's place. to a red Mustang could be amazing: the curious can read James Kincaid; but if you asked boys how he was unnoticed behind a sports car's wheels, he would definitely protest, "no!" What fantasies and inconsistencies the movie offers are mostly seen within the first fifteen minutes. Then we get more iterations of the same, in an increasingly rough and skewed progress, which far from inconsistent turns out to be predictable. Not that it was, on the other hand, literally credible - but it was unfair to tax Motorama especially with this error, any probable cancellation of unbelievers who fell at the bottom of the typical movie maker's and viewer's scale since the "Raiders of the lost sheet" became a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> "Hallucinatory": How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing we have one? In any case, some people know that they enjoy "hallucinogenic substances" - but if Motorama indicates the outcome, then I lose why someone would take them more than once. There is of course an occasional bad trip. The film must be one of these, sayings and all. "Juxtaposition of words that were spectacular": How many times a 10-year-old can scare you by saying "Oh my God!" when he likes something or "damn!" when he doesn't? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script. Unfortunately, any kind of surreal in what passes for dialogue can only reveal, in direct proportionality, its naivety of speech patterns in the rising American generation. <br /> <br /> "A world that is completely defined and minutely depicted, but that makes no rational sense:" The world of motorcycles actually has no meaning, but it is about as defined as a comic book in a primary school newspaper. The many guest stars in the cast all have cameorolls even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" in the blink of an eyelash, but needs several seconds to boil the lying lie. And even * his * character, despite appearing in almost all scenes, gets no significant development. Here is little reward for any viewer who sympathizes as I must, enough to want to know him better and understand "where he comes from." You can feel a much better story slightly and the protagonist struggles to get out. <br /> <br /> "Fully recognizable, realistic painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking framework." No, we see a number of stereotypical and increasingly fake billboards, gas stations, greasy dining halls, cheap hotels and their lowlife habits along the roads, exactly where they belong. "Much responsible for continuing ... the traditional emphasis on content." There is little content instantly in Motorama. In summary: Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on their way to a magnificent costume party that sits silently and stupidly as cautious drivers empty their Rolls-Royces as fragile slate through a rowing sea of ​​desperate humanity, Chinese praying through windows and forge the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium filled with abandoned antiques, limousines like those now rusting, and white pianos shattered by ghosts. In this, detritus walks a exhausted boy and a sick woman whom he adheres to as a mother figure becomes girlfriends who fall asleep next to the grass. He is awakened - on the Transfiguration party, "white and glittering" 1945 - with a glorious glance at the horizon, which is not the rising sun. Finding that his conscience has become a corpse, he first believes that he has experienced his soul that goes up to heaven. Later he only explains a little less innocently: 'I learned a new word today: atomic bomb. It's like God takes a picture. 'Now there are only two examples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism, whose ironies ripple far enough to invade the title of his movie: The Sun's Empire. If you're looking for surreal, * thank you * don't miss it. Unfortunately, he stepped on the accelerator to drive his cart through and outside the desert. No scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle or beautiful await Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest. None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumb down on this movie. Although I am disappointed with it, I cannot dismiss it in view of the respect of another genre as it exemplifies - one certainly influenced by surrealism, but also of expressionism, existentialism, and the pessimism of Franz Kafka amidst almighty power structures. Let's try the size: The Absurd Theater. <br /> <br /> In connection with EB's article on this style, I am amazed at how far Absurd's Theater is a valid artistic style, over objections against Motorama disappearing like a blower of smoke. I am tempted to quote the whole text as support for identification. <br /> <br /> The absurd trial theater shows that "the human situation is essentially absurd, without purpose ... humanity remains feeling hopelessly confused and anxious." After achieving its goal of getting away from a Depressive home life among parenting parents, Gus finds out of course until he passes an excellent billboard reading "Motorama" and decides to win the lottery it promises. As others have already revealed, this ambition is illusory: even though the game "never expires," the sponsor has no intention of anyone ever winning, and has ways of fooling, confusing and leaving the crestfall any aspirant to the reward. He, like others, is ultimately disappointed with his dream. "Absurd dramatists therefore abandoned most of the traditional theater's logical structure. There is a little dramatic action that conventionally understood. Characters perform, their bustle serves to emphasize that nothing happens to change their existence ... a timeless, circular quality comes forth. "" Language in an absurdist game is filled with ... repetitions ... repetition of the obvious until it sounds like rubbish. " During a sometimes "dazzling comic surface" we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress." Gus is obsessed with a stupid game, his inane language, the plot unit where he shares a gloomy future and / or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still gloomy turn - so much fits now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some movies, at least by Spielberg, admirers of Motorama as it really should find fellow travelers - not instead of adding - in the works Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. <br /> <br /> But you can't quite stop here. After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first companion he had met, and the one person who had treated him properly even though he had scalded him - at a service station that announced " Pray full-filled! ". Under Phil's guidance, he learns a life to wait for cars. We may notice here that the absurd playwright Beckett was entitled to his most famous game "Waiting for Godot" and that for Godot we should read "God." God is also one of Phil's concerns. In addition, Phil is the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, mistreated and in a throw with his arms straight out horizontal. In the last scene, Gus says, now Phil's protest that he wants to hear music. We hear no one, but we see Phil wiggle with his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm and waving Gus closer, and Gus responds. The end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to a writer whom I happen to read at the moment, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel issue is not recognized as an architect or undermining of Liberation Theology, which is more of a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, he may have to be. Police brutality and corporate greed is a cinema and literature cliché, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and enlightens such feelings with impressive warrants from writings, traditions, and grounds. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is the exposure of the earthly activities of the fallen angels to which the Bible refers as storms and powers. Principles, Stringfellow wrote, are behind all our popular three I am: Pictures, Institutions and Ideologies. All of them praise our worship by making false promises. The more involved in an image, institution or ideology that a person becomes, the more his own personality becomes "depleted" and becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control, and immortality live unbelievably helplessness, chaos, and death. As essentially fallen, defeated forces, they can no more than that. Yet, they are desiring people with the "dominion of the earth," which God promised in the book of Genesis, while none of us actually controls an image, institution, or ideology inevitably carried on its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on their own lives. "Dominion" happens to be a mistake: a more accurate representation of Hebrew would be "stewardship". But this is a nuisance beside a more fundamental problem: Most of us fail to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam * before * the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, his descendants, are still exercising it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> One can add two observations of CS Lewis: First, "man's conquest of nature" is merely an illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about conquering some men of other men with nature as the instrument; And secondly, unlike popular belief, Satan is not a kind of good time Charlie. He might dive into pleasures at first, but he is very niggled with them and will pull them from every human being into his slave, perhaps letting his prey sit in front of the fire, which unfortunately felt sorry for himself and sweet with anger . <Br /> <br /> Now, when they apply these insights to Motorama, we think they reflected remarkably in Gus's experience. He is, if not nice, at least a beautiful little boy before becoming a victim of the Motorama game. The first signs that advertise it look glamorous. The farther he continues, and the deeper he travels toward the sponsor's headquarters, the more shabby they become. He is lonely, meets no one else who plays the game. The stations handing out the cards have either fallen into ruins or manned by zombies. The people he encounters along the way are increasingly ugly, deceptive and hostile. (The fact that the parents correspond to a common dictator does not mean they can respect each other). Gus's humanity is made out of him as he not only becomes fully self-centered and unaware of the needs of others, but partially blind ... disfigured ... prematurely aged while the child is literally challenged in a literal sense. Eventually, his precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash, and he must continue in a wreck of death. But in the end, after doing everything he thought was expected, he presented himself with the principle of his proud tower to receive his prize. Using the biblical power to confuse those who have built such monuments into their own vanities, the agents avoid him, disappoint, offend, and eventually throw him from the top floor. He falls long and hard, lands, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classic symbolism he dies. He has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this fate turns out to be just a warning to look into a changing future. He repents and returns to Phil, and after seeing him perform the very first generous, selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half. We notice that Phil is now disabled and can hardly insert a snake into a tank, he asks, "Can I help you?" When he saw the "helpful" sign, he decided to apply for the job and explained to the motorist who he was hitch-hiking on which he expects him to come out here because it doesn't look like a bad place to work. <br /> <br /> Of course, this interpretation is likely, and it can, of course, surprise or even frighten the movie's "cool classic" aficionados who see completely different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama isn't quite my cup of tea, I'm certainly convinced that it's hardly the worst movie ever made.
