This two-character drama is extremely well-functioning and has a valid message and some really shocking moments (shocking, not because they are graphic, but because you're not prepared for them when they arrive). But in the end it becomes oppressive, just as it did a little like "A pure formality". Alan Rickman would have received an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt. (** 1/2)
