This film shows that the free business system and the quest for the almighty buck exceeds all racial and ethnic obstacles. Ultimately, the marketplace determines the message sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans led by a no-nonsense black man who wants to earn a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something else, the marketplace and the political system require him to adhere, which makes him no different from his predecessors. Interesting, off-beat movie.
