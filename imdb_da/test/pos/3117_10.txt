What can you say about a short little movie filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad notions, not a poorly delivered dialogue, and with the cold violence on the one hand balanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists of the story? <br /> <br /> It's a jewel, a diamond, a precious gem of a Western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. A vest that is not settled by great heroes such as Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of the daily man and woman, peasants and ranchers, merchants and miners and hangovers, whores and barkeeps and the entertainers of the day, some looking at wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for freedom of religion. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps a very spiritual story, but does not promote any particular religion, even the non-Mormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. Acting in friendly and noble ways towards everyone in history, regardless of religious affiliation and belief, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the lane comes on the stranded medicine showing people. And in true biblical style, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, the guardians of the angels are sent to the lorry, which must eventually head to the evil incarnate Clegg clan, similar to the snake in the Garden of Eden, and sorry What it is they must do afterwards. It's a sweet folklore tale about the West that hits every goal that John Ford takes care of. <br /> <br /> Today, I have a Western Santa Claus whose red clothing is covered by a denim drive jacket whose red sock is replaced by a brown Stetson wearing a burlap bag with gifts and a bobbin rope. To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to stick into his waist. When people in the office ask why my santa should wear weapons, I simply answer "snakes!" After all, is the Christmas spirit not one where everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Forty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the film's characters and history are still as relevant today as they were back then.
