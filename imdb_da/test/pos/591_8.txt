The Muppet Movie <br /> <br /> directed by <br /> <br /> James Frawley <br/> <br /> Kermit Frog and friends relive the stories and stories of how they all came together. <Br /> <br /> The Muppets star in their first feature film, bringing the magic they are known for into a bigger picture. The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts. The well-written jokes appear as each figure gets a worthy introduction. The comos are not just thrown in, but written in as interesting characters, making one of the many peaks of our frantic friends.
