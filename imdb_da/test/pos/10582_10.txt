Okay, let me break it down for you ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see. It has a blend of a unique story of a guy who has girl problems, and everything goes backwards for him mixed with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the movie, basically if you've seen jackass or CKY series , then you have "I know what to expect for humor as it has most people from these movies. All in all ... I had to give it a 10/10 because it is one of my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> ~ For4k3n <br /> <br /> (PS) Haggard rules!
