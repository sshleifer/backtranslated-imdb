Every review I have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation as he did for the Norse in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the weight and rhythm of language and deeply affects what is said and how it is taken. So listen again and notice the difference. The game is well done and the rhythm of the word is so much better than that provided by people who use received, polite and familiar English. I recall that a teacher in a school in Leicester inexorably asked me, age 14, to read a piece of Walter Scott, which was written in the tone of the border. I come from the border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference.
