"A small case of murder" is an excellent television movie that is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a film critic, who accidentally kills his mistress, and then try to hide the crime. Although it may sound dark, the movie is actually quite light hearted and fun, with many memorable lines ("Acting is harder than I thought - you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology" and my personal favorite "For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day, and why does it always count?) The movie has a great supporting cast, including Macy's real life wife Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin. !
