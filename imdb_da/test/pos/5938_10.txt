If you enjoy the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you'll love Murder 101. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke again in a murder mystery. If we are lucky, this will be the start of a television series or at least series of films. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly had some amazing and remarkable actors who fulfilled the roles. But it didn't feel like a "face" movie. It really was a story that made you make you forget the fame of them on the screen. I made a guess at the end and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that I had to see it again! This is a must see for any mystery buff or Dick Van Dyke loves!
