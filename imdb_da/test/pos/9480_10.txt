The first time I saw this DVD, I was not only pleased with the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put everything out, but also because the DVD itself is extremely high. Jimmy Page can clearly not live with quiet music, I think. I must say, however, that during the concert at Royal Albert Hall they extended 'How many times' and 'Moby Dick' too long. Other than that, it was exquisite. My favorite song from all the time is now on the DVD. Tramped Underfoot. It is either one or 'in my time to die'. In that song Jimmy really plays that good. Have you ever seen Randy Rhoad's game? Now Jimmy plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
