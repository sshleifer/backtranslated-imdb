I fell in love with "staying in a great way" when I first saw it! Reason # 1 is because I love ADORE and is a big fan of GENE KELLY. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his very good looks and his sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was such a master. This film exhibited his amazing talent to perform. I also enjoyed Marie MacDonald. It was my first time to ever see or know anything about her, and this excellent movie also made me a fan of her. In fact, the whole cast of this movie was comfortable and amazing. The mood between the butler, "Everette Hanover Smythe" and the father, Mr. Morgan; Mrs. Morgan's courtroom humor, and especially Grandmother Morgan's immediate affiliation with, and concern for "LEO GOGARTY." And GENES number "FIDO AND ME" is sweet. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend that someone watch this movie. It will really remain dear to your heart forever. Or at least it has to remind. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I rate it my # 2 favorite GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and own a lot of his films. They are part of my daily routine! So trust me when I tell you you will love this movie! See it and enjoy !!
