I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was another wise forgettable to just bad grouping of movies. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent but simple animation, is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Fun, charming and touching. A little piece of heaven for cat lovers, romanticists and anyone else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your city, then see it. This one card is worth the price of admission.
