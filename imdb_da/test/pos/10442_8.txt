When I watched this movie in my youth, I tried the soundtrack. Some bands of the soundtrack that I still didn't know. But during the film I have already noticed her quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones, Commodore's .Sensational soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, this movie has long since passed on television. Today he passed in cable TV and I remembered accessing the page to make the comment. The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but that's what happens in real life. Not always what thought of being the ideal, that's what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us many surprises.
