The three-part series ended last night at PBS, which I think was its first broad exposure to an American audience. The accuracy of its text and the unique quality of its films are high points. It seems to be very novel to see and hear an action game that employs the Georgian English people's language, Jane Austen's filmed drawing rooms are the primary example of this kind of speech. But it is the scale of the drama overwhelming the senses that make the picturesque language fit perfectly into each scene. Such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants such as Tolstoy or Shakespeare while being entertaining in the form of a C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian maritime story. The universality of the basic human condition is at the center. Narrator Talbot as the game of an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name Benedict Cumberbatch (surely not even Dickens could beat it!) Alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, a play turn de force. In fact, I cannot remember among this very fine cast a mistake of interpretation. It is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> The most impressive element, however, is how perfect on-board life is a war strand en route to Australia in the early 1800's. This is especially true of how the ship's movement becomes almost a sign in itself, but some fun stories rarely take into account except as a background. Anyone who has ever experienced molds more personally, recognizes it immediately and appreciates how much it must have been recreating within the framework of the movie. This is not imaginative Pirates of the Caribbean. Some effort must be exploited to gain an understanding of its nuances.
