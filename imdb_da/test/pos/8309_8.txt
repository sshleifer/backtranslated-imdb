CONTEXT is everything when you go to judge a movie. When considering this movie, one must consider the time it was made. We didn't really know what the inside of the earth was these days, so you can't shoot the movie too much for the plot (based on a much older book). For the era, this was first-class effects and the production quality was great. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. For that time, makeup and effects, almost the boys in the rubber boot make as plausible as a monster thing. This is pure film cheese complete with bad rubber suits, models and creepy costumes. FANTASTIC. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
