This show was incredible but too esoteric for most people. If you had never seen a European black exhibition in the 70s or 80s (or at least a Mexican), the whole show would probably be lost to you. If you had that, this show was a death on scary satire of the false play and superficiality that these shows dive into their worst. The heart of a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan from an EX wife, "Viva Variety" is a black show trying to get out of the ground every episode but always falls into the fighting and actions went very wrong. The hosts are associated with "Johnny Bluejeans", a weak witted sidebar, which seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means kids will like him, which of course they don't. <br /> <br /> The result was a hilarious spoof of various shows in general. Imagine the argument that probably happened BACKSTAGE in the last days of "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine that ONSTAGE is happening in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their peace. Now add cheesy actions and a Euro-Riche mentality (tuxedo, dress, booze, accents and smoker). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was quite written to other musicians? For conceptual? Viva Variety made this a comedian. The way is also esoteric for the American American audience. It was fun as hell. And doomed.
