I would be interested to hear from the director, Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to make Mere his first film, and more specifically what his interest in hippies - or rather this form of Euro-hippie paradise - and about their death. The film is at least true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it is strange, biased. It's a given heroin (aka, "Horse") is horrible thing, rotten, the conclusion for many a dumb headed drug user who sees it as the very best - all because the basics are: after everything else stops, it becomes life, And it is either a running race for more of the same or death. More start as something about a romance between a New York girl and a German man, but it will be something else, for better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene). It is basically about two "young" people, Estelle and Stefan, who meet in a city where Stefan has come as a kind of wandering away from his homeland. She also walks, kind of, and is perhaps too friendly with a big-time pusher named Wolf. They end up in a remote island somewhere nearby, and after a little bold grip for some Estelle horses, they also find a cushion in the form of an apparently remote house along the coast. Schroeder's commentary on youth, sex and drugs is not too simplistic, which makes the film clear and intelligent so many years later. It is both direct and subtle, more about the characters, and about the fact that what he portrays could in other hands be just a propagandic hippie exploitation. Perhaps most comfortable, and this is just a guess, Schroeder uses as inspiration the kind of long order from Bergman's summer with Monika: two children in a relentless connection, some good some certainly not so good, opposed (also?) Perfect shot landscapes . <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I have to mention that there are problems, some big ones actually. The performances are not very convincing throughout; a few scenes hit some power or have the actors in a good relationship with each other, but Klaus Grumberg leaves himself, although he is an ornery German by nature (in that case I would have preferred Klaus Kinski in that part to make it more crazier but deep enough for the subject) like the farmer himself. And there are holes in na√Øve in the manuscript that keep it from being as deep as it really seems to be. On the other hand, there are two great things that go after it: Nestor Almendros, the big film photographer (ie Days of Heaven) is DP and is a big boost for a first-time instructor like Schroeder. Almost every picture is seen with a fantastic purpose or artistry, be it a shot of the rocks by the sea or the sun or something as simple as the apparent natural light in a room. The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the most important reason why I and many others have heard about the movie in the first place (year before I really knew who Schroeder was, I saw the "More" track when I looked up Pink Floyd- album). It is very good music throughout, occasionally the insane variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Part of it is also a bit boring, even though it is a film that relates to free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I would not rank it anywhere near as high as a message or animal, certainly not Dark Side, but it also helps raise the item another notch, especially when you least expect it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings like Stefan or other walks on the street. It is almost better mood than the movie itself deserves, but in general it is still worth looking at as a period, but poor, but powerful, as a less ambitious but more comprehensive Zabriskie Point.
