This really is the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing brought to life. His novels are all unfathomable (in any real sense), and that is the only long story he wrote. It was John Houston's last film and did not reach the screen until he was dead and it is easy to see his touch of grandeur. The dead are poetic in their on-screen approach and tell us more about Ireland than any modern movie on the IRA, and the "problems" could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully, more people will watch this movie and experience the finest of both John Huston and James Joyce, and maybe visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest story ever put on paper).
