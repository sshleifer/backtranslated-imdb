Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After a few casual prisoners deaths, Rackham enters Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara Bach also happens to be on the island too! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who like to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian produced provider seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a touch of WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff. In spite of some wonky-looking fisherman costumes, the movie benefits from some beautiful location photography and a good twist about halfway through. All the actors are good, and Joseph Cotton himself pops up like an old biologist. Director Sergio Martino manages well enough, as there is action ever 10 minutes or so. It cannot be said for his delayed follow-up THE FISHMEN AND THEIR QUEEN (1995), easily one of the craziest and most off-base sequels since HIGHLANDER II.
