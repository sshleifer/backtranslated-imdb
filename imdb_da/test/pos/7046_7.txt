I rarely disturb even watching comedy movies or television these days. They are harmless, vulgar and most importantly not funny. This could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. It's worth looking at, and I don't think it would be dated in any significant way. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good to write, regardless of the era that is created. <br /> <br /> I'd love to watch this movie again; It came to mind after seeing the somewhat similar "Summer School" on television recently. Like the slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" is fun without being cruel, too sexual or devoted in bathroom humor. The key is, of course, how the adult character makes such a difference in the teenager's character - perhaps even an almost life-saving change - and how they both grow up in the summer's space.
