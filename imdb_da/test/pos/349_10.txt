This is one of those games where you love to bite or hate it to spread. Although you are a hardcore Mario fan, you do not like this game. You can hate it because it's 2 short and a little boring and easy. Or you can love it because it's a mix of great graphics (not a Nintendo fan of great excitement) music or game play. I know many people who say it's great and others who think it's the worst Mario ever. It really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you are. I personally love this game and I think it's the best wii game, but you should decide for yourself. So I think you should definitely get it if you are the right Nintendo fan. But if you love the classics too much, you don't like it. So try it for yourself.
