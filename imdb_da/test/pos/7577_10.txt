I can never remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall in school, but when my son told me that they saw movies in class, I would also see it. I borrowed the video from the library and saw it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I knew only a few months ago that there were successors. I've finished watching them this week. I discovered a little oops: In the second movie, Skylark, Jacob reminds when he was a boy, and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In the winter, these "brothers and sisters" do not exist in talks between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I've only caught it by watching the trilogy, second time. Great movie, one should look for good healthy family viewing.
