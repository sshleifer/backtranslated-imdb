Where this film differs from the traditional Hollywood movie, it is a true depth of emotion. In Europe, for example, we have had war years, and although a nation could never exterminate the other, the old enemies always joined each other or together with each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrant white population eradicated the indigenous population to near extinction. The American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This, in my opinion, explains Hollywood's often simplistic character when trying to explain a foreign country's struggle. But in this movie the instructor and the manuscript did not fall into this clich√©. It turns out everyone in history has some real and some wrong. It is a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
