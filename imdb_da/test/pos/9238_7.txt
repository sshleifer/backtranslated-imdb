watch this movie. It is really a good trip through the difficulty of making an indie film, and what happens when it blows up in the filmmaker's face. There are many things about punk rock and the philosophy behind this movement and it is relationship with this project. so if you are in old punk american punk, you dig it .... but beware there are lots of bad actors from the failed project that are incorporated ... but they sometimes come in fun at times. and actually hear some of the best parts for people who have never been involved in pontificate film making and what they went through in the three-year period it took to put it together. So everyone out there who has to make a movie, especially if you haven't been to film school or worked on the track, you should see it here and learn from the filmmaker's mistake.
