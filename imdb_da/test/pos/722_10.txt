I saw this movie not knowing anything about it. I had assumed it was a sci-fi movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The reason is spectacular and intelligent, the cast is all charismatic, and the whole movie just makes you think of a change. Some of the puzzles completely blunted me, but in the end the answers were quite simple. I am very surprised at the low score of this movie when I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this. There are no great special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all. It is about the plot, about building the characters and building an atmosphere. However, it is a movie, but ultimately, no answer that can annoy some people, but I thought the ending was amazing. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not .......
