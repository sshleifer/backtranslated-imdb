Two things can happen when an ensemble cast is brought together. Either you are about to leave the theater and ask, "Why?" or you receive MANNA FROM HEAVEN, a lovely comedy from Burton sisters whose mother not only inspired but the manuscript itself. Ursula Burton, plays Theresa, a nun whose friend and family had always thought she was touched by Gd. When money falls from the sky, the clan uses young Theresa's belief that the money was a gift from heaven to let all their dreams come true. Years pass by and we find Theresa returned to her native Buffalo. She comes to the realization that the gift must be repaid and brings her friends and family together (Academy Award winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) to return the debt before Easter Sunday. The money has long been spent and all the signs are in financial difficulty. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, a husband and wife con team, teach all important lessons in life, how to dress for winter in Buffalo and my personal favorite, "they expect you to take the strainer verware" when visiting a restaurant. The audience can only hope that if Theresa reaches her goal that someone will not run away with the money. The film teaches us that it is not money, but itself that makes our and others' dreams come true. Each action has a result not only for you but the community around you. When we look at the mirror, we see ourselves as we would like to be, MANNA FROM HEAVEN, the question of how others can see the picture we want to reflect. Burtons has done an excellent job of steering the throw to break out of their shells and create new and inventive characters. On the day of multi-million dollar budgets, this low budget Indy shows that it is not cash in hand but true talent that will draw the biggest laugh. Wendie Malick (US President Just Shoot Me) adds a special flavor to this already talented cast.
