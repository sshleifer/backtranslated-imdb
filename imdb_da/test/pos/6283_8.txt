I was thrown as Surfer Dude in beach scenes. Almost was thrown like muscle guy, as the real muscle guy was really really late in the day. Pauly had my brother and I (skateboarder in front of the tattoo site) doing some vj things in between taking live from Venice as he still does his MTV thing. This movie is also really good. Would it have made my top 100 if I wasn't in it ........?
