The movie Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a movie, honestly, I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said they would have a 2 week screening of the movie with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the blood of classic French crime films, ala Jean Pierre Melville, I jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would correct his great works, and in the worst case, I would get something good popcorn in a big theater). It was worth recording as Classe tous risques is one of the kind of French movies just waiting to be rediscovered (or discovered for the first time). With great excitement, the Sautet keeps the tension on a tight rise for the first 40 minutes of the movie, keeps a good (if not large) mid range and then ends up with what is always expected with these movies, but with fascinating motivations using the characters. With a movie in the vein of this kind, you know how it will end, but it is the cool, attentive journey that counts. The film has a true truth and honesty, in the midst of "old-school" criminal code, by Lino Ventura as Aldo, as at the beginning of the movie (one of the best on a movie in this genre and country ) steals a large sum of money with his partner in crime). When there is a sudden ugly fate on a beach late one night, Aldo is again on the run with two young children. He gets help from Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role similar to Le Doulos only with a smithy more humanity and charisma) who is also a thief and drives him to Paris. But there are some issues with some of Aldo's old business partners, and an old score may be the right ticket. A few times the plot may seem relaxed, but it is not. Like Melville, Sautet does not allow any fat in its history, and it is a very tightly structured movie with some good doses of humor every now and then (sometimes I laughed at the criminal injustices in the first hunting sequence and also with a special woman who had a fine things with his cat and a fish). Along with a fine score of the great George Delerue, there are outstanding movies and a mood that rarely meets, let alone matched the adays, Classe tous risques is a reminder of the bridge between the real old-school movie noir and the last day crime film . Gangster in these new kind of "thug-life" movies has a 1000th of the class and honor of the thief in this movie, and is another banana for the works Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic, moral edge also helps.
