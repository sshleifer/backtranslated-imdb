The Hindi version of the movie is 121 minutes. Seen in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the underground of women. A educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the limitations imposed on her as a widow by her community. The film has a beautiful look at it, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of depth to portray Binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and infinity. Binodini's idealism does not come across, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains buried.
