A must for any die hard carpenter fans! <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb makes the KC's role a fair amount of justice, and while history is not 100% in fact, it's still a good insight into living for both Richard and Karen and worth seeing just for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Make me cry everytime !!! <br /> <br />
