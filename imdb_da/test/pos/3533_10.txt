Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. The movie, while slightly influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", is extremely scary and memorable. The excitement almost never let us up and the atmosphere is really creepy. Cast is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are good female leads. The inbred twins are really scary and relentless killed. The movie is beautifully shot - it was actually filmed on site at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little gore, but a killer when Verchel is stuck in the groin is quite unpleasant and unpleasant. A must-see for slasher fans.10 out of 10-what more?
