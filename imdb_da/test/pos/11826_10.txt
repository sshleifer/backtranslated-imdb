And I don't understand why the show gets so much to beat. In my opinion, this show is really excellent. Well the first two episodes were not that big, but it takes a momentum in the third episode. Which seems to be typical of a Steve Moffat sitcom. I would rate it among the best sitcoms the UK has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, it is not in line with Fawlty Towers, but you can certainly rank it as high as a black adder, clutch or the young! I see the first season and all I can say is that I'm happy I bought the DVD! The problems with this show are and why it was tasted so hard, according to the internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers and everyone was disappointed that it wasn't! Well even the Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is clear from all prejudices, at least give the show a run (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thank you Steve Moffat for writing it and thanking the entire staff for pulling it out!
