E. Elias Merhiges Begotten is one of a kind of surreal depiction of mankind's treatment of religion. There are a few different ways you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: A god disembolk's self, and out of his body, the mother's land jumps. Mother Earth then fields the god's body after slaughter and impregnates itself with what is left of his seed. Then she gives birth to a messiah figure that stifles, presumably in childhood, but possibly with terror by becoming alive on earth. All this takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that the rest of the movie consists of rugged characters pulling the messiah (as ceaselessly shaking or seizing) across a desert landscape. The robed figures pause only for that brutal messiah, and continue pulling him around. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your world view. It can easily be interpreted as a gloomy nihilistic atheist allegory of the total lack of apparent power that Christian "deities" can be perceived as having in a modern society that merely invokes their names to advance its selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory where you see the movie as how humanity has twisted Christ's message about so much that the original purity and innocence no longer have relevance in a world where the message and image are inappropriate accustomed to supporting everything from interpersonal violence to war to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> Image images are phenomenal and you won't see anything like that, period. If you can, see the original VHS release, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the pictures change on the DVD, but I've seen clips of this streaming on your tube and the effects are severely reduced. On the VHS version, Merhige achieved TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. Significance is basically not a mid-tone except for some grains in some of the shoots. Apart from that, this movie offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is amazing, hallucinatory and rather disturbing. This film makes Film Noir look positive and is mediocre. The shoots fall into each other in a surreal way reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou without completely finishing it, for an effect that has been called a cinematic Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> It is said that the film can certainly try a patron's patience and commitment. There is no dialogue for starters. The only sound in the whole movie is a rather constant circuit of crickets chirping, occasionally peppered with gurgling and agony of the dying deities and an amelodic drone synthesizer texture. Personally, I find that the movie likes to listen to experimental industrial music as the instrumental NIN remixes of the downward spiral era, more abstract noise / experimental music such as F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works pretty well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. It's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this movie, it's PRIME for post-modern re-contextualization, like projecting it during a performance of avant-garde music or composing avant-garde music to accompany it. <br /> <br /> When the Messiah figure is born, there really isn't much for the rest of the movie, which means you're pretty much sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the Messiah's figure, there is fabric around the desert and beaten . It looks incredibly beautiful, but there is no new unfolding. It helps to cement the filmmakers' intentions to communicate that for thousands of years, people have used Christ's name and image for personal benefits, but can be tedious for a casual viewer or a person with a short attention. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie with excitement, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique movie experience and you are not particularly fond of the regular Hollywood movie theater, this can be your shaking messiah.
