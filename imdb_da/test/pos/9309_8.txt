It is rare for a movie to include both the problem-solving process and the stunningly far-reaching moral quandary and be a fairly precise historical movie, but Fat Man and Little Boy pull this trick off. That is the story of the Manhattan project - The Second World War effort to build the atomic bomb, as the conflict between the two men made it happen, Gen. Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The historical figures are a great study in contrast: military vs. civilian, practical vs. idealistic, emotional vs. scientific, brute force vs. consensus-based problem solving, immediacy vs. long-term vision. A fictional character played by John Cusack is added as a kind of synthesis of the two historical figures to show humanity, which oddly escapes the real people (and of course the obligatory love interest played by Laura Dern). One who is looking for a straight documentary can criticize the decay of the melodrama (and occasionally looseness with facts, but it is Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths, so I believe it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> One of the big pictures in the movie is when Oppenheimer testifies to the first nuclear explosion: It is done completely through its reaction, and given the amazing visual effects associated with a nuclear explosion, it a brave and completely effective way of describing in a single moment the ambivalent effect on people who release such power (the kind of things lost in the typical Hollywood shoot-up version of the story.) The use of Music is particularly excellent in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Straightforward and highly recommended as both a historical movie and a drama of the highest order.
