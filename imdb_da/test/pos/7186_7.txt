The French people are not known to be big movie producers. <br /> <br /> Although their Amelie scores high scores on the Oscar. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film of what I am used to by the French. It's a great movie, especially for kids. The only thing that offered me was that it was spoken in French and subtitles. Usually with the English-speaking films (here in Holland) I don't have to read the subtitles. But with the French language, just read to understand. The story itself is just amazing with Obelix, who doesn't remind himself, but there are also good details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the story from the comics, and this movie shows all most pictures by pushing the book. Everything is in it, from the sphinx nose braking to the pirate red beard losing three additional ships. I would say a good movie for the weekend with the kids.
