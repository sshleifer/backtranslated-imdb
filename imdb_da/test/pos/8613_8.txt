Sex is comedy, but not driven by a fantastic imaginative plot, effectively concentrates on the relationship between film director and crew during the filmmaking process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relations and, more specifically, the problems and problems experienced by actors involved in capturing sex scenes . Director, 'Jeanne' emphasizes prominently all the way, because she is the one who carries the plot forward instead of a narrator and gives us many little gems of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator that relates to her assistant and other problems she finds with her new male leadership by connecting him with a masculine stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship characterizes something about human nature? the tendency to be unclear. On the one hand, they see two close; when he is not in sight, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses her masculine pride, perhaps in a feminist take on things. <br /> <br /> The taboo of what constitutes obscenity is brought up: the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful because it is factual, which constitutes indecency - that is the director's justification. However, this is double ironic, because the film we see is in itself a construction within a construction. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie than just relationships, of course. Watching this movie is not just a matter of analyzing it to derive some kind of meaning. One can enjoy the natural lighting that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and credible. A static camera is sometimes used in a heavy composition, and at times the camera is shaken as a home video. If you're looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon, it's not too heavy but still lets you think: that's it.
