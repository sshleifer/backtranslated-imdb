The "gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes and reveals its characters and message over time. The extra editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate approach is wonderful to feel that you are on the path of discovery as much as the signs are. The additional access is also its disadvantage; There are a few scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters that seemed to be flip until I saw the interviews that were in the bonus materials. I'm glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more rounded understanding of the movie overall. In addition to the story itself, it was great to see women as comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was very tastefully finished; very questioned. You have a sense of seeing a love story and a life story unfolds, not a voyeuristic sleaze movie. The physical characteristics of the athletes - their reality - is a great contrast to the sometimes essential character of the plot. <br /> <br /> Not a movie I will have to watch again anytime soon, as the story is simple but the delivery is strong enough to stay with me for a long time.
