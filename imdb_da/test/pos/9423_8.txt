I liked this a little more than Terror by Night, but not enough to give it extra *. The beginning is just brilliant as we look into Nazi agents who are planning to get their hands on a new bomb and its inventor in a small Swiss village that will only be faked by a disguised Holmes who jumps the scientist back to London. Once there he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes' arch enemy Moriarty. Of course, the researcher disappears, leaving an exciting coded note, and Holmes goes into pursuit again in disguise. A climax in the Moriarty's waterfront is suitably exciting, and we can all guess that everything ends well, can't we? A little over-the-top patriotic message that credits the role. Now when I think about it, the fine sense of space, despite the obvious set of Rathbone's use of disguise and the way so much plot is injected in just over an hour - is what it gets extra * and is my favorite of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce movies I've seen to date. Watch DVD, part of "50 Mystery Classics" from Mill Creek Entertainment. Many of the transfers on these cheapo-box sets are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans note that the Rathbone / Bruce films (which are 4 on this set) are all quite visible and reasonably sharp.
