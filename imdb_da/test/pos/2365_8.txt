Great 1980's Comic Strip comedy seen in southwestern England. It is a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and murder by the sea. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Plans (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) is trying to impress the boyfriend by boasting that he is involved in a multi-million pound drug deal. This leads to complications with fun results. I am trying to figure out the original aspect ratio of this movie, but it does not appear under 'Technical Aspects' on the IMDb page. I saw the DVD in the store and it seems to be in 1.33: 1 (full screen) format. Was the movie shot in this relationship, or was it originally a widescreen movie with a pan and scan DVD? It would be helpful to know when I hate pan and scan movies. Then come on IMDb. Can you find out for us?
