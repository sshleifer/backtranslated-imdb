Once again, I am amazed that Thomas Gibson did not head in the lead earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson again demonstrates his ability to understand a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man from the late 20th century. Tender not yet widespread, afraid of the basic principles of love, Gibson's character touches a number of emotions. Also appreciated is Cameron Bancroft's performance. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror, unlike his best friend's "homosexual conquests", gives dynamism to the relationship, which in many ways is unexpected. Bancroft and Gibson's chemistry is evident from the first scene they perform together. There are many "panels" in this quilt. From homosexual relationships to equal relationships; from heterosexual relationships to exploration of lesbian love; This film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer in its core. My only regret is that it took 6 years since the release before I discovered this movie! I look forward to seeing it again and recommending it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or director Denys Arcand.
