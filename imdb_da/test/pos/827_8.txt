I thought this was the most interesting movie that JCVD ​​has done for a very long time. I loved his character and everything with the rabbit set a different tone for this movie. IMHO, JCDV can really be on something forward. A bit more light hearted, some obvious tribute to other movies, mixed in with some great fights ... I would like to see more of this style of film production from him. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a desperado rip off. Immediately I also saw the R. Rodriguez connection, but thought it was very smart and made me watch the movie again to look for more subtle signals from other movies. JCVD rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the dungeon fight? Nor did I like the first one either, but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me a bit of balance by giving us something we had not expected. Made it seem more real. <br /> <br /> I also always laugh when directors cry as 2-year-olds that their movie was "stolen" from the studio. The directors are paid to do a job. The program is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have a definitive end to a movie. In this case, the JCVD ​​is the talent and the only reason anyone sees this movie. I'm sure he got a movie he was happy with. I have a relative who works in a post office who knew a bit of history. PRESUMABLY, the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. Everyone who saw it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​changed the study and re-edited the film. These things happen all the time. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his "delicate genius" ego was severely broken because they hated his supplied cut. If this director was smart, he should have taken credit for the one who would have been his best.
