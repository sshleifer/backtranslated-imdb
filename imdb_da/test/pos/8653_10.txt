The movie is a great look very thoughtful. I think it's a movie about how your similar would be if you lived in a world created by catalogs. The scenes are all perfect recreation of an Ikea catalog, they even see furniture on their TV. When they break into the kitchen, they break into another perfect picture of how a kitchen will look in a catalog. When he is reborn or what he wants to call it, he returns to life's hard reality. I love the bit when he tells his new love that he has left his partner. It pokes fun by commercial bliss by saying you can get it all and while it's nice to have the same stuff, but some things you don't want to share. A movie without children too. Say gives a perfect ten.
