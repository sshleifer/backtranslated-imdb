If you are like me and you bought the new Tenacious D album the day it came out and went into the movie and knew all the lyrics to all the songs .... then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Yeah, I'm biased like a big Tenacious D fan, but I really liked this movie that made me chuckle quite a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was just about everything I expected. Comedic genius backed up by good songwriting and some amazing cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially enjoyed Tim Robbins' part. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Tenacious D's HBO series and a fantastic debut album, then it may not have the same comical impact on you. I still recommend you to go see it because it still worth every cent of the admission price and will make you smile even if you are not in stitches all the time.
