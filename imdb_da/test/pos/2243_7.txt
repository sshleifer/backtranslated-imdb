Beginning as it went out, Doctor Who, Rose, his alternative father, Mickey, his alternative counterpart Ricky and Mickey's little gang find themselves rebellious at the mercy of this reality version of the cybermen, this second part of the 2 episodes Cybermen's bow feels more like a Doctor Who episode, unlike the previous part, which honestly felt like more of an episode of the rejected show "Sliders", which was given a good show in itself. The bow as a whole was enjoyable enough, as I am one to subscribe to the maxim that someone who is good who, but at the same time it is inevitable that this will be compared to the Dalek episode in the previous series. And the mentioned comparisons would only make it seem like a lesser work as it is. I just feel that this story could have been done in an episode. Remember, in the first part of the review, I said that these types of stories dealing with alternative realities usually do not have any lasting consequences, and this is not the case here, but what changes are generally felt and not really in line with the character. /> <br /> My character: C +
