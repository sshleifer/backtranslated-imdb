The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again, n still aren't happy to see it. I've watched this movie at least 10 times over the last 12 years, and it makes me laugh as if I saw it for the first time. I have great taste for good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n Chong, Monty Python series and many others, but this one on Hindi is one of my favorite excellent movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are the Golmaal, the Munnabhai series and the Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the movies I have said above. That's what I call the Hindi-Stony comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in the Hindi cinema. Driving to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie.
