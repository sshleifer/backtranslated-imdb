I L-O-V-E this movie ... everyone and their grandmother's sister lawyer dentist need to own it! its witty, devilish, exciting, comic and full of toasty action-packed goodness! With this movie, the amazing people at Troma give you a whole new perspective in the history of Romo and Juliet in ways you would never have thought possible! It has the possibility of an instant classic - car crashes, delicious scary sex scenes, feuding families, street fighting, great music, cut heads and lemmy from mot√∂rhead. and it's just a taste of what it has to offer! every person I have seen this movie with now owns their own copy or longs for ... A +++++ and ++
