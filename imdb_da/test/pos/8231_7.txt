This is a modest and modest traditional western with a formal plot of opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially routine and contains a number of classic Western conflicts. There are ties versus cattleman; There are clashes between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand, and the desert / frontier ethos on the other, and what this represents ultimately is the resistance of two value systems - democratic and societal values ​​that have been against robust individualism. /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays legendary lawyer Bat Masterton, who rides to Liberal at the request of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him clear the bad guys who are the hard drinks, sweltering cattlemen. The two men quarrel but reunite to handle the troublesome elements of the city. <br /> <br /> The script is clichéd, but the action is propelled along with the vigor of director Ray Enright, and there are solid performances all quiet. In addition to the fierce appearances of the male leaders, there is comic relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain nicely played by Steve Brodie and attractive contributions from Maggie Meredith as a primitive Easterner proclaimed by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a salon singer As long as you do not put a premium on originality, this is a good solid entertainment for Western lovers
