Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can run like the flaps. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the largest, naked space vampire zombi from Halley's Comet running amok in London, the final movie ever made. Tobe Hooper may have made a lot of shit, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror, he deserves a place among the immortals. Plus it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best that comes out of France since Simone Simon, uses the entire movie nude. As she does very, very well. Just keep in mind that while she is the most overwhelming feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered, she is also "totally alien to this planet and our way of life and quite dangerous." It's a joke meeting I would have loved to have put in: Astronauts from the British space program find three nude humanoid alien life forms inside a huge 150-mile-long artichoke / umbrella-shaped spaceship tucked into the tail of Halley's Comet filled with huge dried bats and bring them back to earth with almost apocalyptic results as they continue to drain London's population of their life-force in the midst of much nudity, thunder-balls, and spitting your coffee across the room's direlogue ("I've been in the room for six months and she Looks perfect to me. "" Suppose we don't know anything, which undermines the matter. "" Don't worry, a naked woman doesn't come out of this complex. "). Oh, and we get the authors of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with unredited rewrites by the author of Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here is $ 22m ?? Have fun. And they do. <br /> <br /> True, there is enough law on the raw material to have done something real scary and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria approached its height, a sexually transmitted "plague" provides ample opportunity for allegory ), but in the hands of Go-Go boys on canon, what could have been another Quatermass, and the Pit quickly instead of being more Plan 10 from outer space. It's completely breaking with horrible inanity, be it Frank Finlay's hilarious death scene ("Here I go!") Peter Firth's grand entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine." "From SAS?" Discreetly discusses Michael Gothard over a room full of journalists: "Gentlemen, the last note was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation" he corresponds to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offer Mathilda Mays naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping reanimated organs exploding in dust everywhere people, the sweaty prime sucks life out of his secretary and london fill up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on-screen scrapping since Mrs gorgo lost junior on battersea funfair and went on rampage. And it does not mention "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire "It will be much less daunting if you just come to me" while a leading sportsman driving Peter Firth adopts his best Action Man voice to answer "I do just that! " In a scene alone, you have an obsessed Patrick Stewart who embodies the woman in our deeply confused astronaut mind, Steve "I-never-over-playing-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full on "Heroes-Skeleton!" fashion tries to resist the temptation to kiss him, the infinite Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones look detained) plays the secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of denied Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of the actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no one saw it anymore) hamming up blas√© public school macho in the hope that no one will ever see it and the monstrous reaction shot of john hallam as the male nurse who continues to open the door's mid-psychic tornado to obtain more drugs. As if they needed more in this movie. It's just a shame that Frank Finlay's insane scientist, who is not qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski), missed the action in one. <br /> <br /> No matter how angry you think the movie is, it still manages to be enchanted whether it is a zombie pathologist ("he needs feeding") that explodes over the secretary's suit. Patrick Stewart's blood and guts form a nude Mathilda May or Rumvampires turn St Paul's Cathedral into the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship. I loved every wonderfully insane moment. In its own unique way, this can be the greatest movie ever made. The DVD offers the original 116-minute version opened in the UK, rather than the heavily edited 101-minute version of the United States, which not only gives much more hilarity to your dollar, but also fully restores Henry Mancini's score to its original glory (the American version covered many holes with additional cues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although a somewhat surprising choice at first glance, Mancini carved the teeth of many of the classic universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s, and his score is absolutely stunning, with a great headline giving a rare reminder of how interesting he could Be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is no more than one trailer as an option, although it would be nice to hope one day on a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from Hooper's originally intended 128-minute intersection: from what is shown here, they can only offer yet more comedy gold!
