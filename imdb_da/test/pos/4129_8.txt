The movie has taken a little flat to play fast and loose with facts. But it will put you close to being at a time and place that no longer exists by coming to the * feeling *. As Keith Richards notes in Paul McCartney's film about Holly, there is some Buddy Holly in almost every stone made since his day. The tragedy that took him is handled gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful muscle. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey makes a remarkable and energetic portrayal of Holly, and his notions suggest that he really gets into the music. As a Holly fan and rocker, so do I.
