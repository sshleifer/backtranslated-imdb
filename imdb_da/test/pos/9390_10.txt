This movie throws its head into the surrealistic area of ​​Lynch and Jodorowsky - with an atmosphere that is strangely convincing, lulling the viewer with the dreamlike intensity of his images. The story is to be savored - the narrator is trapped behind a painting (beside the bed), who often speaks for it, vocalises his wishes and reasoning. Yes, Beardsley would sound like that. <br /> <br /> There are some mistakes, but its strengths overwhelms its weaknesses. The sequence of the woman, who winds herself out of bed and crawls around the floor, tries to escape, leaving you breathless. <br /> <br /> The movie has a fine-de-siecle air about it; and should be read as a disarming call of the intestines of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bathe in it.
