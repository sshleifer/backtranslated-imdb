It's a pity that this movie didn't get any more to play in theaters. It is a rich, textured love story of credible, all-human characters that are too preoccupied with games and protect their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is its Chicago setting among hip, artistic, literary, middle-class African Americans discussing poetry, music, and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate - and if you yourself are a half fan of his, you need to watch this movie! His boyish boldness and vulnerability are perfect for Darius' role. Nia Long is also shining like Nina, who longs to tell Darius that she loves him, but is afraid of the break "rules." A great movie to look at the curly on the couch with your sweet!
