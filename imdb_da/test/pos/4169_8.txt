Wow. This movie is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith leads us to the darkest depth of Man's soul, where we find love, life and top-shouting. The World's Tired Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a brainwash to find hygiene in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly encounters confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), the performance of machismo and a jealous of humanities foibles. The epic movie comes to a climbax by a gut-wrenching top-roping competition that will make even the strongest wild viewers squeamish at the dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: Top-shouting outside, Top -Prop in the gym, Cut shorts and annoying flannel shirts, Awesome climbing photography (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!), Bear and Snake attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see the romance evolve a little more. It looked as if the movie led to a spicy, top-roped sex scene between Telly and his new lover, but unfortunately it would not fit into the already jammed one-and-a-half thrill ride. <br /> <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough. All in all, if you're ready to challenge your world view of humanity and climbing, this is the movie for you !!! 1
