What makes "Fire" even more attractive to see apart from its magic artistry is its touch of feminineism and rebellion. In my opinion, Shabana Azmi's very character is a symbol of Indian feminine protest against Indian society. The name of the movie and stage, when Radha goes through flames in her kitchen, is symbolic of Hindu mythology Lord Ramas wife Sita goes through fire to prove her immaculacy, as in the same story, also seen in the movie. The film can be a great inspiration for women, especially those on the subcontinent, to search for their freedoms and gain control over their lives.
