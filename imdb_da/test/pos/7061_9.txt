Watching this movie always reminds me of what I remember that summer is like, God! long time ago. The whole scene involving "overnight", from the canoeing process to the end of the trip, is valuable, and Tripper's story of the homicidal madman is urban legend right out of my youth. A very entertaining movie did many times better off the terrible followers that followed.
