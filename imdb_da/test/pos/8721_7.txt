Apart from the disco scenes that epitomize the swinging sixties (especially with all dancing to instrumental versions of Monkee's hits), I am surprised at how well this light farce lasts 37 years later, but it does, in fact, thanks to its soft performance. deception-based plot and the sharp interaction between the three leaders. This 1969 comedy is directed by the redoubtable scene-to-screen expert Gene Saks, dealing with Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor who pretends to be married to avoid long-term engagement with her young boyfriend in a year's time. Toni. In response to Toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni insists first on meeting her wife to ease her conscience. Enter Julian's devoted nurse Stephanie to play the wife, and the inevitable complications come with white lies that grow into large swirls that lead to supposed links and disconnections. As Julian, a casual Walter Matthau plays dexterously deceptive dentist in his typical Sardinian way, but he lets off his two female co-stars with the picture. In his big screen debut, a pixyish 24-year-old Goldie Hawn still retains his giggly "Laugh-In" persona, but gives unexpected cunning and depth to Toni. She and Matthau have a large, undisturbed chemistry in their scenes together. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still rarely royal of 54, has, of course, a ball that plays Stephanie, which is initially starchy and fast-paced, but flourishes into a released spirit as history develops. I especially like how relaxed she is after her overnight stay. There is a good support from Rick Lenz as Toni's Bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's smart actor, Company Harvey. Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, I.A.L. Diamond, it gives the sparkling manuscript and opens the story beyond its stage-based origins for Saks, which is not the most cinematic of directors. Apart from a couple of trailers, there are no significant additional features with the DVD.
