Here we have an intelligent mix of typical hongkongmovieshootouts, worlddestructionthemes and intelligent filmmaking. Not that the script doesn't have its big holes and a few special effects are a bit cheap. But the cinematography is an optical treat and the soundtrack is top notch. The mix of fast action sequences and colorful slow, sometimes almost poetic parts has no comparison in its kind of movie, so a classification is pretty tough. The closest genre is a disaster or terrorist film with deeper human and political notes than usual. Worth seeing around the world in cinemas. But I hope for this for so many other (mostly Asian) movies before and no one seems to believe in me. Unfortunately.
