Just to rectify something in a previous review here, I don't think that this movie is only for people who know London, it's a case of a very specific situation used to make general comments. Jack Rosenthal said in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be characters that, by going through this cruel test of knowledge, gain some degree of self-knowledge. I think it is one of the most perfectly written plays I have seen: Technically, it is extremely skillful to convey quite complex details, but it is also happy about how it involves you. In the beginning, you no longer know about this London Knowledge Test than the protagonists, but you will be scooped up right with them until it is very important to you. You become hugely proud of the characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially one whose downfall without giving anything at least will make your hands fly to your face. Also, as a fact, Nigel Hawthorn's character is called Burgess, the Vampire, not Dracula. You don't need to know this, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a goal of the drama: Once you've seen this, you want everyone and you want to evangelize about every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you see it. <br /> <br /> William
