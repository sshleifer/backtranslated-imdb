In the 13 years of schooling I had from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day that my class took a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school from 10 am. 8.30 to 3.30, and no archived tours were taken. But for some reason I couldn't remember this advanced age, we went to watch a movie - National Velvet. I don't remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th year I decided to see it again. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a time that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and did not lock their houses. A time when people benefited the doubt. It was once when the family was the most important thing. This movie shows all that and more. It shows love and trust and care and human goodness. It would not be a bad thing for any family to watch this movie once in a while and discuss its message. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to see young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at best, Anne Revere, Oscar's award-winning performance, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who performed for nearly sixty years. /> <br /> What movie!
