This production was quite well done for a TV original, which provided a very suitable original slope on Swift's work. To make the frame picture good, the movie begins with Gulliver coming home. Everyone who has read the book knows that it will happen at least. The frame's story about the book has Gulliver's confused confusion in sections. For example, he is appalled that he will trample some people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the film has all the book sections within a long journey. When Gulliver tells his travels, the editing cuts from England for the journey are very effective. I confess that I found them intrusive and annoying at first, so they became natural. Finally, they have also become a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people are listening to his convincing imagination, even though they doubt their truth. For example, his hatred of filthy Yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section goes well when he defends his own beauty. The assembly between events in England and similar events or scenes in the story is very effective. For example, rip the cloth from the table to suggest the movement of towing a group of ships inspired to film. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. Swift only speaks of this by having the long-suffering wife protest against further travel. It becomes a natural part of this story. Casting and action were competent throughout. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's crazy magician is amazing. O'Toole's little emperor kills lovely senility. Many specific complaints from other authors here hit me as a simple personal preference, which after all is what we are about here. I read the abbreviated version several times a year from fourth grade on. I may have escaped the complete version for a college class but have read it a few times since. And I had to start it again when I started reading about this movie. While the Danson version is better than any previous movie, it does not replace the book. But I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you haven't read the book, enjoy this movie and then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire in it, you'll find Swift's "A Modest Proposal" and his "Drapier's Letters." Both are satires who attack the annoying treatment of Ireland and Irish during Swift's time. The drapies are protesting cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped in Ireland. These were Woods lightweight coins, not good at face value when paying taxes and official debt. The scream from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another battered British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's torture experience a chance. I think you will find them thoughtful and entertaining.
