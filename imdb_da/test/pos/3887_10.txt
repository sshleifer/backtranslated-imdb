Garlin is undoubtedly a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is its own creation and production, tells the story of a struggling Chicago actor James Aaron, whom Jeff obviously identifies. He resembles James wonderfully to Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul as he exposes James's dilemmas to a wide range of actors who are in fact Jeff's friends, many other fellow citizens of Second City. <br /> <br /> He happily uses Sarah Silverman's diametric cuteness and scathingly absurd humor to exemplify how, despite sense and talent, life's satisfaction can often believe unnecessary frustration. Bonnie Hunt provides a unique achievement as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Don't let a simple story mislead you, the characters and the conflicts are well thought out and poor. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality humorously and not necessarily fiction, which can easily be confronted, will appreciate his dialogue-driven story. We will surely see Garlin work a lot more as an instructor and writer with other talented intelligent comic actors who perform the great challenge of making life fun.
