K-Pax is a very exciting film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really a stranger, or is he a mentally fake man who just thinks he's a stranger? It is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must respond within the self-presented deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility. His ability to map from the memory area of ​​the galaxy where his home plane is located indicates a knowledge that no human being could have. Yet, the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very genuine and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality disorder. The ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know it. Usually I don't like ladies or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing. I have my own theory that fits all tracks, but I do not know that my theory is more correct than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") spins the story delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example of the instructor staying in the shadows and evoking excellent performances from talented actors to let history dominate. This is not to say that the steering is technically inferior because it is excellent. However, Softley remains unobtrusive and delivers great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasing change from today's leaders who visually grabs and shakes the viewer as though screaming: "See how brilliant I am!" <br /> <br /> Once again, Kevin Spacey delivers a fantastic performance as Prot. This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding and requires Spacey to make the cool and logical Prot one minute, then shift gears to evoke its agonizing alter ego during the next hypnosis. Spacey is as trustworthy as both alien and human, making the viewer's task much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also great as the relentless psychologist obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. I rated it a 9/10. If you have to close at the end of a movie, this movie will be very frustrating. But if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you in mind long after the credits, you won't be disappointed.
