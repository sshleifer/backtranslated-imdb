Millions in gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Traveling together, Lois Lane is reporting it. Along the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. They loosen the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. This leads to a vicious battle between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves override them, but Lois Lane jumps in. She knocks the thieves out of the train (at some point using a gun), but the train begins to break without control. Lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. Good thing Superman is coming! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting, non-stop action. Probably one of the best of all the cartoons. Just fantastic.
