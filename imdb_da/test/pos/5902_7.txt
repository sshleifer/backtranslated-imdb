This is not quite the best Canadian movie ever, IMO. I don't get out of track and name 3 or 4 better. Just a couple of nights before I had seen "The Bicycle Thief", the highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their movies at a certain time and place, with minimal resources in terms of set and cast. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to look for the realistic attitude and characters alone. The lingering shots over the faces and landscape make it almost worth seeing on their own. That said, this is not exactly the same league as the Italian classic. The film is shot in a frigid, barren quebec asbestos mining. This freedom is in contrast to the people's warmth and the eyes of the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, what you get is a series of vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not having fun - but exciting, and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now warming up with the nostalgia patine. The film winds; there is little excitement. Somewhere about half to two-thirds throughout history begins. Everyone you have met to this point is involved, and you have become aware of these characters quite well; so take some patience from the start. The story is a good one; It will let you think, and it involves sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all those things, you won't be disappointed with this.
