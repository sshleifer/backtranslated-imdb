I caught this little gem by accident back in 1980 or '81. I was at a wake-up theater to watch two old silly sci-fi movies. The theater was packed full and (without warning) they showed a bunch of sci-fi card spoofs (to get us in the mood). Most were a little entertaining, but THIS came on, and within seconds the audience was in hysteria! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" who had large cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. She looks at the camera, gives a cloudy smile and nods. It made it even more fun! You must see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like a Muppet! It was extremely stupid and stupid ... but I couldn't stop laughing. Most of the dialogue was drowned out by all the laughter. Also, if you know "Star Wars" pretty well, it's even more fun - they are trying some fun on some of the dialogue. This really works with an audience! A certain 10!
