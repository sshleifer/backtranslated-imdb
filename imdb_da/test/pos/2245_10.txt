Once again Doctor Who delivers the goods from the bucket load. It has humor ("You just do it while you go!" "Yup, but I do that brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case even more kick-ass cyber people), tragedy and scary tactics. In short, what the doctor ordered (word game). The way the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no sense of "getting on with it". So chalk out 3 of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh so you cried and made you go "eek". <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is clearly the clinker for Noel Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the doctor's companions, you know that he will do the right thing and maybe even suspect the way he does it. But it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path. <br /> <br /> While the "Cybermen's Rise" had several of the creepy structures for terror, "Age of Steel" is a blast. Like "Alien" in relation to "Aliens" - both true classics, but in different ways. Can the series stop at this level? Lets hope so.
