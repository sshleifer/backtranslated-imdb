especially considering that on the one hand, I can count on the romantic comedy films I've ever had. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is very good as a heart transplant patient who has a mysterious connection to Duchovy's new deceased wife. (I can think of several horrible films that have used this story line - I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour) This film is, however, a keeper. Duchovny is sympathetic and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog misses his late wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement and there is an entertaining scene where he is blind and Driver is a waitress. His date is horrible and he finds himself fascinated by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles as the curmudgeonly grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only movie I've seen him in) round out the movie's comedy aspect. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie because history works, it's not too romantic, and doesn't offend the public's intelligence. Highly recommended 9/10.
