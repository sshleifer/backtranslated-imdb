When someone refers to the independent cinema area in the United States, it is often deduced that this means that the film maker or the people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This is not always the case today, unless someone is a solid "auteur" and creative freedom still comes with the warning that one must find distribution with one of the independent divisions of major studies or by being picked up at one or more another way of low level agreement on a valuable film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's movie about a hard-as-nail African-American, happened to be promoted to lead the advertising guru of a production company, * is * an independent cinema, the kind of work that went straight to likes or Romero's Night of Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces while not getting any really typical studio distribution, but causing waves, kicking ass and names in the cinema world. For all its moments that are rough and raw, it is unforgettable. It is also a movie that is fun, very and scary fun. Sometimes sense of humor is just so ridiculous that it is almost impossible not to laugh, from President Mimeo's mere appearance with his wife to lines of advertising dialogue. Swope's team puts together as "I can't eat an air conditioner" in a real "soul" voice. It is as smart as the audience it aims at, which is someone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work is not offensive or * also * shocking, because it is supposed to rattle the cage, and that makes it beautiful well in the first five minutes. When it's over, Downey Sr goes to his flash as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose: his protagonist is del Fidel Castro, a part of Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes it is 1969 in the movie) and some hard assed ad exec with a firing strip to make Mr. Spacely on Jetson's look cheek. And don't forget the side signs, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track of. From perhaps the most hilarious botched assassination attempt in any movie to one ad for "Face-Off" skin cream that contains lines that would give South Park a run for its dirty mouth money for just a little except one guy from Jack Hills film plays the Muslim who continues to lips to Swope, and one boy with the nun who curses a storm and impresses Swope in a swift blow. It's a beautiful direct message on media and advertising, but there are also many powerful moments where it just hits the head of racism in America, sometimes without having to do more than one gesture and sometimes doing something big like Having black panther types goes this way and that about Swope's advertising regime. And for a low budget production (I mean super low, therefore the comparison with Living Dead and Faces Night) Downey got some really good actors, all non-professional, and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera here. <br /> <br /> It should be mentioned that Downey's style does not make it perfect: it is raw and sometimes too crazy and dated to your own good and I am sure I did not do it. underlying humor of a couple of ads since I am from a full generation after these ads were submitted (although "Miss Redneck Jersey" was definitely not lost to me). Generally, this is one of the finest in its time period, a satire that sticks and a feature with a predominantly black casting that knows too much about what comes from a surplus of power, regardless of skin color. It's like someone might say "good s ***."
