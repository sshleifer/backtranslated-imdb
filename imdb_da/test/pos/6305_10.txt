Maybe my review should be a 9, but the movie stunned me completely when I first saw it, and my latest view confirmed my first faith. Stylishly, every scene has made scoped views, amazing angles with a perfect sound side that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Get on stage from especially Toni Servillo, get it together with one of the most beautiful and charming women in Olivia Magnani and a fine plot and you will end up seeing this little masterpiece again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentino's next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which is in competition this year's Cannes Festival, will be eagerly left.
