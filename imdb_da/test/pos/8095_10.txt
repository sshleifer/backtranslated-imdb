Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only one of his talent would address this bold topic - a comedy about Hitler. All large satires are based on going out on one edge. Also, all major comedies deal with the other side - pathos. This film looks like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove employs The Great Dictator with the story through the distorted satire lenses. The only way to deal with this world's horror is by laughing at it. And hopefully, by laughter, we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another movie that does what comes to me is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So let me see the movie first.
