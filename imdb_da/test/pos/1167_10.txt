Sean Connery is very good as the great Raisuli, the Ruler and the defenders of the believers. This is a fairy tale movie with Arabs, Germans and USMC, all of which come to grips at some point. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main and supportive characters. The story is based on the true event where a wealthy Greek-American businessman was kidnapped by Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius has replaced Candace Bergen and her two children as victims of the kidnapping, and it opens the story for a lot of literary license. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie allows you to remind viewer of two of the most famous (but mostly forgotten) political quotes from the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says, "Pedecaris living or Raisuli dead!"; and John Huston (also good as State Secretary John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador on a white house dinner: "You like knifee, you like banquet?"
