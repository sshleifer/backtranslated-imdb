This movie is filled with little surprises, many of them fun. The fact that it is written and controlled by a 24-year-old blows my mind. Some of the scenes where high school kids use ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because I have a child of age and I could picture her using it. As a parent of a teenager, I found the pictures of parents and child interactions to be dead on precise. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie's many small jokes, and I enjoyed the fact that everything wasn't perfectly sensible and not all issues were resolved at the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the truth is alien to fiction, because fiction is bound to hold onto what is possible while truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that plays with the viewer, allowing us to believe that People are what other people think they are, only to allow us to later realize that the people we assumed were right, were totally ignorant of the real situation. One of the film's strongest scenes, a scene where we feel very light and sympathetic about what the character does, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while admirable, is completely wrong. It is very subtly done, I think. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I liked the point a lot - I thought it really helped the movie, really helped set the mood - the movie has a few screwball moments, and the background music helps set it up. <br /> <br /> The valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half - got a big laugh! The movie is really in my head right now - so this morning. Will try to see it again, time allows. Tens are hard to come by, but a solid nine in my book.
