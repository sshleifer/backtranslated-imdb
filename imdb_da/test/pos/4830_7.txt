This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best thing the festival has had to offer. I went into this movie with little to no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the horrible vampire girl The Forsaken. and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie stars Lori heuring of Crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just gone. She moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine, a burial ground for overtime children back in the day. Unfortunate for them, the children return with a vengeance that kills and eats everyone on their way. The film works on many levels. It is well done, exciting, it has special spots of good filmography and talented performances. The atmosphere is grim, but a little underwhelming, the score is decent and the makeup effects are cruel and simplistic. The film keeps a scary and disturbing tone and the children themselves with pale skin, torn up lips and hollow eyes are quite scary and unsustainable. The film is original and inventive without being artistic or complicated. I can't see this movie making it a broad release without any trimming and a little fine tuning. But they certainly have a good product on their hands and should pursue some sort of theatrical distribution. But the theater where I saw it was terrible. The sound was terribly messed up, which I felt took away from the movie majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen, which killed the mood a little. All in all, it was the most satisfying of horror celebrations, perhaps because it had the least expectations, but it was nevertheless a welcome addition to the genre film.
