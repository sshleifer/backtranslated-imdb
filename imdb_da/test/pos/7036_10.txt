I don't really know what it's about Dirty Dancing. There is some kind of absolute magic in this movie. I may not be able to tell the hundreds (yes hundreds) of times I've seen it begin to end ... but every time I come across it on television, I am anchored and mystified and sit down and there I am for two hours to love the movie as if I see it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray absolutely hated each other in the whole movie, they have a beautiful chemistry on the set .. it makes the viewer enjoyed much more to see this passion and commitment .. and I can't help tearing a little at the end when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells his father, "No one puts Baby in a corner". (classic moment) For all the people who believe in this movie, are corny and sappy, perhaps in a way that is, but it was the penicillin in the 80's movie and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. <br /> <br /> Three Bowls for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> The Ps Soundtrack is amazing, an absolute masterpiece
