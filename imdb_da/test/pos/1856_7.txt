As a non-theist I will not comment on the great man's theory, which changed the world 150 years ago. Certainly, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said then. <br /> <br /> The movie was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could easily have been shown on television. While the play is amazing, the film itself is not really a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then it is. But I have seen many period style dramas on BBC TV and they were well up to the finished standard of this. Just don't expect too much of a big budgetary round when you see it. In some ways, I found the film almost to go on a limb to apologize to religious fundamentalists. Though it achieves a good sense of excitement all the way through, I couldn't help getting it to the release of the Origin Origin much faster than it actually did (you're waiting for the end of it). And it seemed to be far more than I ever knew about Darwin's struggle with himself and his wife Emma, ​​and he portrayed him almost as a kind of insane, lunatic at times - which is hardly true. There are many other flaws and facts lacking in the real story of the origins of origin of Origin as well, but the whole film's focus is almost entirely on how much Darwin faces in the home with the book and a small part on his beloved daughter death, Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie goes away as she asks one last time to hear Darwin tell her the story of a captive attack that died of pneumonia. Although you will probably feel a greater connection with the primate in that scene than with Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> With the early controversy that apparently surrounds movies in the United States, it will work well to promote it and make many more people see it. But to be honest there is actually very little in it that offends any mythical divinity. Its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all. But as basic Christians (and many other religions that we are all aware of) such as wave a poster or two whenever possible, I assume that this movie is as good an excuse as anyone. Personally, I can't see what it is. But maybe they're just monkeying around ...
