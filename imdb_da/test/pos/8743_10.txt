Traffic is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. This is the European produced PBS series on which the Oscar-nominated movie traffic is based. If you loved traffic then Traffik is a must see. Generally, I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The manuscript is exciting and unexpected, as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers, smugglers, farmers, politicians and police officers. Unlike other films that sensationalize the issue of drugs, Traffik presents it as it is.
