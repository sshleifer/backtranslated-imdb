The first time I saw it was when it came out (1994) and the last time I saw it was just before you wrote this review. It still makes me laugh my brains ... after all these years the dose is not disappointed. Really the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian movie that deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best performances in comic roles. The thing that makes this once less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing ... The wit is refreshing and not cheap. This is a movie really before its time. If you haven't seen it yet, see it now !!!!!!!!!
