Although I'm not a Michael Jackson fan, I like some of his early songs and some from Jackson 5 too. 'Thriller' is one of his good songs and comes from the best-selling album ever with the same title. As for the video, it is fantastic, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and strange. <br /> <br /> There's a story behind this video, but it's so complex that even I don't fully understand it. It's freaky. The most exciting thing is Jackson's transformation into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and the dead people dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cool and original. There are amazing scenes and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old pop from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I like Vincent Price's soliloquy. He makes a great story with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laugh at the end is amazing! My favorite videos of "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Don't Stop" until you get enough "(both of his best songs).
