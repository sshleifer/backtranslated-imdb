Women like this movie better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies seem more than men - on average. I generally like romantic comedies quite a bit, but I considered it a 5.5 for the first 50% of the film and about 6.5 for the next 40% and about 9 for the last 10%. So apologetic I will judge it a 7. I lose and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and no one is 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie a little more than me, even though I'm not sure why. I'm a bigger Drew Barrymore fan than she is. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this movie was about a young woman going back to high school (undercover) to write a story about the high school experience today. She was a dork in high school the first time and must learn to be cool second time. Her journey towards cold, as well as falling in love with a teacher, is the story. <br /> <br /> What drove me nuts in the first half of the movie was just how mangy she looked. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realized how capable she was to look like a dog. So much so that I really don't think I will see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Of course, she turned into a pretty attractive (sweet) woman at the end, and she became very popular. The end is about a 9.9 in the very sweet scale, so you juicers out there will like it. Otherwise, it is not very memorable and can easily be avoided.
