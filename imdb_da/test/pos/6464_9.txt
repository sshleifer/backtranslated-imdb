This is an excellent film that addresses the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performance all around, but excellent, works by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He makes this movie breathe and live. His depiction of a guy who fights against discrimination and violence is simply thinking. His action is powerful and delicate and subtle at the same time. Really worth an Oscar, Poitier had to wait (because of his skin tone) for many years before the sheer glory of his acting was recognized by the Academy. Cassavetes also becomes a good performance, withdrawn, restless and realistic as it has become his hallmark. He and Poitier infinitely contrast the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is entertaining and at the same time deeply haunting in its depiction of racism in the United States. The irony is that it somehow reflects the realities that Poitier has to work on.
