I just watched the movie through Netflix. I was fascinated by the way the film was described, but in the end it was better. I was moved in many different directions while watching this movie. I was filled with evil, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain, and finally relief. Looking at the accused young man would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person. The police are incomplete, enabling you, just as Rodney King Beating brought up the police brutality, this movie generates the total lack of moral fiber in these cops. And the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it infuriates you more. <br /> <br /> But I must tell you that I fell in love with Mc Guinness's lawyer. One of my favorite lines when he told us what was a ** hole in the police ... The police told him to continue to suck on the cancer stick. Mc Guinness told the policeman ... "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I told him I should screw him "<br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some of the law in this country .
