`Apparently 'is one of the funniest films that come not only from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It's a movie made in black and white to get some of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the entire plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics, and fiction critics "Gunnar", played by Swedish famous actor Gustav Hammarsten. The main role "Gunnar" is the kind of person who, although his intentions are best, seems to draw everyone near him in a very fun way to disaster and to a living hell, especially for one from the Finnish war, homecoming, wounded soldier, played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train is also a doctor who cheats his wife with his mistress. Together they have planned to murder the doctor's wife, who also travels with the same train without any knowledge of her spouse's intentions. Will the doctor's wife love the plans to kill her and will anyone else survive the unfortunate guy "Gunnar"?
