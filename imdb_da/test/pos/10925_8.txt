I just watched this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama that two brothers fall in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for the closed ones, to look at this. I have come to love the short film genre after I have just seen a couple because they have to get an impression on you so quickly and I have to say that this was definitely sitting. It described some things that I have never ever thought of that way, incest for one. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I don't care too much for the end. Just once I would like to see a gay movie without killing myself for departments. They almost always seem to end in tragedy. However, it was sweet how they should be together, even though it was in death. I gave it eight stars, and I recommend it to everyone because I think it gives an 'inside look' in the world that this movie gets you started. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening, enjoy.
