I remember hearing about this movie and how it played at almost every entry theater here in Toronto. It is about a group of girls who are not accepted by the other sororities in their college, so they start their own, and of course call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie that just breaks with the drive-in nostalgia! Lots of fully equipped t-shirts, vans, battles and a showdown football game like no other! It has been compared to "Animal House" which is a good movie in itself, but for me it is not something comparable to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further because H.O.T.S. girls are to the rescue, boom shorts and everything!
