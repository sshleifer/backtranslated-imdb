In the wasteland that Hollywood Productions has become too late, this movie - in itself - is really "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! In what can best be described as a "sweet" film, approx. The 350-year film-making experience (quite right - give or take 100 years!) Is pleasantly lit up on the screen to tell a tale of deception, rapture and redemption about a Catholic family in Buffalo, NY. <br /> <br /> Really well-placed to take a seat in the "feel-good" movie genre, this quiet little independent movie by Burton Sisters FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart while that you renew your faith in humanity. From the spectacular opening scene from Buffalo, NY to the final credits, the movie manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family, anywhere. Nevertheless, this particular collection of family and "family by union" in a small, non-descript house in Buffalo is more than appropriate to the bill. If you've never been to Buffalo, leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling off" for a visit! The shot of the city's landmarks and surroundings helps bring a picturesque, shaded tone to the movie - which fits in nicely. The quiet beauty of "The Queen of the Great Lakes" compliments, rather than degrading, the narrative being told. If only several movies would exploit the natural beauty of this country's "other cities" instead of running to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more credible. Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble cast again to prove that true talent surpasses Hollywood's "taste of the week" anytime! <br /> <br /> SEE THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You've been walking in the Hollywood desert for too long!
