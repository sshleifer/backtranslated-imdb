Greetings again from the dark. Based on the mega-best seller from author Khaled Hosseini, the film gives us a highlight in the ugly post-Russia invaded Afghanistan and the Taliban's terror. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his CV, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". <br /> <br /> The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown band they share in the next generation. This is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual future story. Some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of really amazing scenes when Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's imprisoned son. <br /> <br /> This is tight and compelling storytelling with a message. The action is solid throughout, without an actor stealing the screen. Although it is not a pleasant story to see unfold, it certainly makes sense and the heart felt. Plus a quick shot of Midnight Oil plays in the pool hall is a welcome gift.
