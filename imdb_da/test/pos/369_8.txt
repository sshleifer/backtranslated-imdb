I was fortunate enough that the movie would come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to watch it. It's pretty hard to find, despite being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which have been repeated later by Hitchcock. First, the end is a bit too neat and "perfect". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes there is an amazing amount of tension; then the five minutes just removes everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The end is also too dramatic for a Hitchcock movie. He is, was and always will be the thriller ... why should he bow to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the end? Apart from the few shortcomings, the film is great. The reason is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know you have someone you want (if nothing else, unconscious) death. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him ... will you accept this bizarre yet brilliant event? You are aware of suspicions, and he is. Thousands knew none of you the victim. And you don't know each other, either ... you're just 'strangers on a train'. Brilliant concept and one that almost every person can relate to. Pacing is good, you never lose interest or patience. The camera is good, but not as good as it is in other, better Hitchcock movies. The action is flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he often uses; the dominant mother, the boy's boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a little water down. It didn't go the famous extra mile that would have done well. It stopped before crossing the line between what is common and what is bold. It is the primary reason why the film fails to be large, but remains primarily good, with the potential to be more than that. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. But everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still gets a deserved 8/10. Well, but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it as it's among his best ... something far down the list but still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock. 8.10
