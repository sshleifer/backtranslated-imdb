What makes this documentary special from a filmmaking perspective is its inaction; who engages the audience to bask in the joy of gypsy music. It renews the form of documentary, while displaying a loss of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primary similarity found in the travel music that (historically) travels people. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film itself is a single "take" of sweeping movement that raises the world and surpasses effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, the simple beauty of our common connection to music, rhythm and dance is breathtaking. If there is a more deeply spiritual, fluid tribute to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures, it has not yet been filmed.
