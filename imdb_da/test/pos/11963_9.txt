In the eighties, Savage Steve Holland exclaimed three films, two of which are classics of what appears to be a very small genre, absurd teenage comedies. The third "How did I get into college" does not measure up to "Better Off Dead" and the one, mainly because of the lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (Except for a little como). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underestimated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags. As I recall, Savage Steve's movie was destroyed as brain died at that time and after three films he was driving into children's television. We could use more movies from him.
