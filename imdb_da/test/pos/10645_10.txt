The well-known close-up of their breakfast flesh that crawls with maggots is still occupied with fire in my neurons or the wind fills the right places of the sails, the fog better than Carpenter's FOG cos is the real terror outbreak of human history rather than pirate ghosts. But I tell you something: Not even the grandiose scene in hands of Brian Di Palma with the excellent music of Ennio Morricone in The Untochables (recorded in slow motion) can match the effect of the original masterpiece of the audience climbing the ladder . We see not only the pram, but I remember the hand of a baby drawn by military boots, a person without feet flying at the last minute, someone wearing glasses (then a carved version) and saw the same glasses destroyed by a ball, who passed through .... mini stories in a single scene.
