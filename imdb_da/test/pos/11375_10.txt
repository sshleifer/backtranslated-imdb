This film is a masterpiece. It was exciting from the beginning to the end. Writer Instructor Paul Thomas Anderson's story of a porn star is told with style, grace, humor and even poignancy. The actors and characters they play are all top notch, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who shows himself a solid actor and can carry a movie. Burt Reynolds may give his best performance ever as a porn director who discovers Wahlberg. The movie recreates in the late 70s and early 80s with poor accuracy, from the disco scene, which starts the movie to Wahlberg's Don Johnson "Miami Vice" suit, which he wears in the final scene. Most regular filmmakers watching this movie will certainly compare it to PULP FICTION, but it really has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The movie is a triumph in style. The open tracking track starting the movie is as impressive as those in PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The editing of Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I couldn't believe that editing didn't receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better edited movie?!). The best scene in the movie should be the one with fireworks. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I watched the movie another time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it cannot have the same effect on television as in a theater with good stereo sound. It's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during their theater performance because it's the best way to watch it. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on television (so get the DVD or a letter box). It's amazing how easy Anderson makes it look, because it's just his second movie. Music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are caught by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.
