William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy or story. Some of his most memorable - and most often read - creations give us wild humor, gentle poetry and hilarious slapsticks. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas with compelling depth and gravity. Whatever he was capable of writing with unparalleled skill and ingenuity, it contributes a great deal to our young language. So in what category is The Merchant of Venice located? I was very surprised to find out that it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read it or seen it before, but having seen the latest movie version, I have decided that it is neither and it is both. This is one of many questions that the viewer must try to answer when it comes to what is clearly a confusing and deeply disturbing moral tragedy. Players are introduced quickly and easily. One of them is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city, creating an impressive vivid and lively backdrop for the drama's actions. To this landscape goes into the youthful Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returning to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father is dead and has left any potential rhythms a kind of lottery. Waiting for the pious lady island's property are three small suitcases, where only one contains "pictures of the princess". Anyone who can guess the right one who uses only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written on them will be encouraged by the father's great fortune for life. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here, Shakespeare's bright comedies take over the film. This Pharisa plotement drives the story and also occupies much of the film's screenplay as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island, humorously guarding and failing to serve this very wealthy hand in marriage. But before any of these, Bassanio, who lacks much in economics, asks Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he has to take to get his shot at the prize. <br /> <br /> Nearly effortless, Antonio reluctantly needs to embrace humility by seeking Shylock's (Al Pacino) financial help, one of countless Jewish usurers who keep the hanging economy depressed but despised and persecuted to no end of the city's pitiful Christian majority. Thus, they live in the underbelly of society, and this is where the two borrowers must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a particular incident where Antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market, and he proudly disputes this man, who honestly has a lot of nerve, is now going to ask for help. But help him with Shylock. He even deletes any interest in the loan, he probably feels he has no reason to worry if Antonio can repay him within three months. Nevertheless, Shylock's one contractual demand is a pound of Antonio's meat if he were to renegotiate their deal. This is a disturbing request, for sure, for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it seems that despite his legitimate pride, Shylock doesn't really expect to see such a cruel act happen. <br /> <br /> So here's the dramatic foundation laid. And while the film is about to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and wrong identities, the grim perspective on the loan is still being woven. In the end, what will happen to this unfortunate deal? Meanwhile, we are back on track to explore Shylock's true central character. Al Pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here and he does so with convincing grin and passion. There are times when he will have room for the theaters, which we will expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those where he internalises this energy, showing a contradictory personality: honest, sincere, and proud, yet brooding, revenge and utterly relentless. This is one of Pacino's most heartfelt achievements to date. And while the rest of the player plays their roles with credit and convincing, it is Pacino who really owns the movie - especially towards the end, when Shakespeare propagates this apparently romantic comedy with a third act of a third act. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal much here; All I can say is that it involves the original loan - a mighty shoe is expected to fall sooner or later. And do it ever. In the end, Shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas to his audience: apparently insoluble issues of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown to us through the last scenes, and while the curtain is dense, the actor's position may be evident to some we are complete illegal. There are winners and losers in this, but have the winners earned their bidding for good reason, or have they lost to a greater extent so well? Has virtue been rewarded or simply flooded? Has justice ever been this time? At the end, some fate is painfully clear and unambiguously sealed. But the audience must be the ones who really determine the verdict for all those involved. And for some, the judgment is still out for the game as well. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cunningly dropped the intense courtroom finale with a conclusion of light satisfaction and applauding romantic decisions. Is he saying that everything is good that ends well, or is it his final, ironic condemnation? The play's humor serves to set us up nicely for such a strong crash. And while it's also what unfortunately keeps The Merchant of Venice from achieving the grandeur of so many of Shakespeare's other works, it's still engaging, fun, and thoughtful beyond the reach.
