James Joyce might write some of the best phrases in English, and his short story "The Dead", ending his collection The Dubliners, contains ?? in his finale ?? Perhaps the most perfect piece in English Language. It is appropriate that John Huston, who retired in trying to film this story, ended his career with it. As with the Red Celebrity Mark and the man who would be King, Huston honored the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. And with "The Dead" (which ended after Houston's death by his son, Tony Huston), we get something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema. Valuing everything the cinema can do as one of the commentators points out "this is not the African Queen" (it also doesn't have to be), it's the kind of movie that's uncompromising for an audience. We all went through the portrait of an artist in school, and one has to bring the courage to appreciate how words and images themselves can touch us. As with silent movies, Huston is looking for something clean here, and he works with his long-standing trust and leaves the world a masterpiece similar to Joyce's original. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man full of self-esteem (and mock self-doubt) reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Epiphanyfest. What is in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of partying, singing, dancing, poetry, where he is asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party. He is distracted by the task that will rise to the occasion, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable to a frightening experience that he survives to him. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift where everything that seems to matter during the evening is swept away by the realization of the impending mortality of all who liver. <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last famous piece of the story "cinematic", Huston brings a voice over and we hear the incredible words that are recited when we see "the snow falls faintly through the universe and slightly diminishing ". It is the perfect solution for a movie maker's adaptation. <br /> <br /> Cast is everything we would hope for. Since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word, and how it brings us together through shared experience, each exerciser seems to be elevated by their role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide range to play, and her account of a young boy who once loved her hurt not only Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it's the transformation she makes in this movie; And when I think of her father, it's the movie I remember first.
