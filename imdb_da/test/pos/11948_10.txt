I watched this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so much fun, I have seen it counting many times. I love the brothers Stork and the pitiful, ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote of the movie is, "It's so ugly, it must be slept." I also loved it when the little sister beats the girls on their backs and their faces stick that way. I love John Cusack and Demi Moore also in this movie. They were great. This movie brings memories back to my college days when I first saw it. I rented the movie countless times and saw it again and again. My college roommate and I just couldn't get enough of it. Who couldn't love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where to get it?
