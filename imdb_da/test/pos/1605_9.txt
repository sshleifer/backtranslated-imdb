From the film's first to the last scene, director Visconti distinguishes his art to the extent that the film is guaranteed to remain as a cultural treasure, for only God knows how long. It's perfection - like a movie, that is, but the story has some minor shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art, so it is of course impossible to bring in another medium. Visconti follows the story pretty much, and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falls. And no matter how wonderful nature is, the excitement in the air between the characters, hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost tirelessly increased service of Mahler's music - still disturbs the minute deviations in the plot. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to flawless the flawless. Nevertheless, I will offer an example that I consider essential. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Man's history, the Aschenbach eats the strawberries, which probably contain the disease that will kill him, after giving up his frustrated hunt of the boy Tadzio in Venice. Can't catch a joy, he settles for someone else - who poisons him. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there. The forbidden fruit, kind, but more a sign of him surrendering life itself. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant beach scene. Chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It also works, but lacks some subtlety and indeed the multi-layered symbolism that gives food to thoughts. <br /> <br /> But it's all forgiven when the movie allows us to stick to beautiful scenery, faces and constellations, and certainly so many other symbols that we may possibly digest - Tadzo's last gesture that stands in the water, is just as sublime and mysterious finale.
