I saw Princess of the Nile for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. Nor did I get over my fascination with Egypt. I have searched the internet to try to buy the movie, but have not been able to find it. It makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you were to ask me anything about the movie, I couldn't tell you anything other than who was in it. I vaguely remember a scene by the Nile with Debra Padget a bunch of other women. I've always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as a flight series again, but I can see now that it was certainly the case. I hope they will put it on DVD and I will be able to see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
