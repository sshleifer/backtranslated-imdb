Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion, this is one of Bollywood's finest. The movie itself gives rise to feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sorrow. Shahrukh's role was incredible, in fact, he gave obsession a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girl-like character, unlike Shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. Sunny Deol's role made the "good guy" the role of acting as the "bad guy" one. The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, imprisoned the public's attention shows that everyone has the helpless inner drive to pursue something that is not really in their hands. Although the film is several years old, it surpasses anyone recently. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits perfectly with the role. He should seriously consider resuming in a similar movie.
