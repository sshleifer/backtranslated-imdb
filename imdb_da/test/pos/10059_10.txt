Why do they all feel they have to put this movie down all the time? It's cute and fun (exactly what it's supposed to be). Madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an Oscar calliber artist with this movie anyway! She did just what the character required and she did well. I loved her in this movie; It's my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's no better or no worse than any cheesy 80's flick. For all critics, just don't take it so seriously and you can have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
