I watched this movie many years ago on TV and taped it from there, I could never really understand why my own mother was sad to see it! It was because I was so young at the time. I just sat and watched this movie again. Now I have 2 children and I had to try to fight back the tears, but that didn't happen. I cried through most of the movie. You can only show how different you feel when you have your own children! Such a wonderful family such a heartbreaking movie truly wonderful! Someone has said about 8 who still live more news, are you still in touch, I want to know! Touched by the movie all the way through!
