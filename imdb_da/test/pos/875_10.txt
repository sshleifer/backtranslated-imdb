This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plant owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words will not do this masterpiece justice, that's enough to say that this is a film that explores the darker side of love and the pain, the humiliation and the capacity of self-deception that goes with it, even though it is dressed as a film noir. Forget about the weak remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the real article instead and treat yourself to some moments of great movie beauty.
