I absolutely loved this show. Never understood why it was called Bug Juice though. I must have been around 13 when it came out. I remember running over the summer vacation on Channel 4, between the Pugwall summer's re-runs and the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wishing I was at the summer camp too - ha ha. All the kids in it seemed to have such fun, it was about "discovering who you are" and "growing up". First kiss and all that. I remember there was this really cute guy in it, I think he was the main reason I got up in the morning of that particular summer. They should have more teen docu soaps like this, I thought it was amazing!
