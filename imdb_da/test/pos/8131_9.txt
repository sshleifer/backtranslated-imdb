This is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acting film. It's fun and sometimes fun. The final is a little disappointing as it tries to pack everything in too nicely a package. The film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen scene, the camping trip as examples. B&B does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most of the characters admittedly accept sexual diversity. In that sense, it is a joyous holiday from the homophobic community. And it is a celebration of flexibility, a solution of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy pursuit of the coming things.
