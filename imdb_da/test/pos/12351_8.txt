Multiplied named and strangely cast, "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum", is one of the better early horror video rentals. Original and quite raw, we meet Adam West card in this movie about telekinesis and teenage age main game. Meg Tilly is daring to spend the night in a crypt of "The Sisters" a high-school gang of hair-jumpers in blue satin jackets. The inauguration is interrupted by the newly designed body of a mass-killing psychic wizard called "Raymar". Surprisingly awesome make-up and scary effects paint this chiller film in style and deliver a heart-popping climax.
