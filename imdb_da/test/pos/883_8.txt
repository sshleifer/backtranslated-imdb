Nice movie. In the beginning I thought it was a media science kind of hi-fi movie, but the end completely surprised me. I assume that the whole film covers too many topics, each of which may be the main subject, eg. revenge, friendship and dream. But it blended them all without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a good movie if it is built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
