So many of us who are devoted to the "art" of the movie will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. Most of the time they are too expensive to produce to be something else. In light of this, it often seems like a miracle to me that really good things are done every now and then. Once in a while, the filmmakers will go so far over the budget to produce a movie that will be badly damaged by the businessmen responsible for financing the business and will, of course, be very angry at this. I would like to know exactly how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some great critics "gunning" for the picture when it is finally released. Awful expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they see. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect but magnificent '62 recreating "Mutiny on Bounty" and you can certainly see it in the reaction to "Heaven's Gate." Cimino took too long And costing United Artists far too much money to make this picture, the company was badly wounded by his profits, and no doubt powerful people were out to see his reputation forever destroyed, as this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. Always many movie-goers who don't like long, weighty images, the story of this movie has not been achieved with a great economy or a fast pace, like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often does not choose to spell the particular statement he makes with a given scene. Rather, he pulls it out in such a way that the viewer feels as if they are living at the moment and gives time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. want the story to move quickly and clearly, and they easily become impatient and confused by this kind of film. These factors have undoubtedly contributed to "Himmelportens" box-office errors. <br /> <br /> By nature, a movie editor, I am deeply frustrated by two issues with this movie. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness. Then we come to the massive, drawn-out battle scenes at the end of the picture. In the case of these, the clarity of the story is actually damaged. If you liked the movie up to the point where it appears, your understanding of what is going to happen is likely to be unclear and that is actually a frustration. When I haven't seen all the hard recordings, I can't see if actual re-recordings would have been necessary or some critical record elements could have become clearer by careful editing of moments. Given the time and money spent on this image, there should have been more care and thought about this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other issues, some occasionally weak actions, a dialogue that doesn't ring true, but these are really minor concerns. The reason I am so worried about the above-mentioned problems is that, like these days, I also feel that in all "Heaven's Gate" is so wonderful to see and so exquisitely dealing with great historical, political and sociological issues, as it is as little as a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it is so dramatic and visually strong that it is the head and shoulders above most other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I would like to mix much of the sound again. I would like to redirect and redirect the scene where Ella is killed, but the magnitude of this image is such that these considerations really become trivial compared to the value of overall production. I should add that it must always be viewed on a large wide screen to achieve the glorious effect it is so capable of delivering.
