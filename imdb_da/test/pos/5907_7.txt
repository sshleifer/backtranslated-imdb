I've seen Jimmy Stewart in all the common roles, but the "St. Louis Spirit" was reported to be one of his favorites. A poor box-office performer when it was released, this movie has largely been forgotten today. To tell the well-known story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, Stewart seems to be very much missed at first, and his well-known voice never lets you forget who you are watching; It feels like George Baily all the time again. But Stewart has of course worked hard for the role, and he does everything right, so long as you don't care that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he portrays. Stewart's Lindberg is so gosh-darn, all-American, apple cake that you can grab the story, and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all the creatures that Yankee know-how he could muster up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the United States, and Stewart seems determined to keep an eye on appearance. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks are wisely used to keeping what is really a pretty boring story moving along, and I was hit by subtle references to beliefs spread through the movie; Lindberg tries to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted with the pastor about his beliefs, or that Lindberg refuses to carry an offered St. Christopher medal to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after crossing the Atlantic. For me, this is a movie, not about a man's epic journey into the unknown, but his realization that this life is much greater than the things we can see and feel.
