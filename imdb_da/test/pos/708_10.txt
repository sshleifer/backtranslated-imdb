The first time I saw this movie I was a child. I was ten years old when it was released, but since my family never went to cinemas, I saw it on Network TV. I remember seeing it alone and crying afterwards. It was only the other movie that was illegal that the answer (Rocky was first) and there has not been many since then. I can't say why exactly; Larry "Rain" Murphy didn't deserve to win more like Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He didn't need any other reason. I have a rule today that when I watch this movie late at night on cable TV (the only time most will come across it) I have to see whatever I have to do the next morning. Fortunately, it doesn't often play like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I'm still getting plenty of sleep, and I'm never tired of the story of a man's urgent prison and personal victory.
