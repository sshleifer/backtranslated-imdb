The title of my summary largely covers my review. <br /> <br /> This is what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was to anyone 5 years older. While I missed the little pop culture wave, I embraced the toy line and tsv. series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Want to know how in this I was? I went as Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the Internet. Thanks to Demonoid, I was able to see this amazing show of my childhood for the first time in over a decade last week. I see it right now, just been blown away by recognizing Rob Paulson of Animaniacs, and I also love celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes in and they have already mentioned, By name: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne and Ace Ventura. Hells yeah. <br /> <br /> Damn, it is only by writing this that I realize there is no way in the whole. I can give this series something less than a perfect score. Any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. This is Awesomeness. This is the mighty one.
