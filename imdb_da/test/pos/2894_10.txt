I've been a "big" rush fan ever since "moving pictures" and this concert is simply an example for anyone who is a fan, why Rush is so popular. They have completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and despite the rain in a football arena, they still manage to give an excellent performance from start to finish. A real example of this is under "yyz", the entire audience begins to sing along with it in a true classic way, in perfect sinc. They really play everybody's favorite songs with a really powerful "lust" that rarely happens anymore. You get the best place in the house for one of their best concerts given. The other DVD is a fascinating documentary from the band while in Brazil and shows you a lot of background things that are going on and it allows you to see them not only musicians but as real people in their everyday lives. This DVD gift set is a must for any Rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your DVD collection. Yours is even a CD of the concert to those who just want to listen to the music. This DVD is worth it!
