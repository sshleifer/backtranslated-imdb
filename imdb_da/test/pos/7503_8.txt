George C. Scott also provides his best and most fun with wonderful drama in this Paddy Chayefsky manuscript. Diana Rigg is attractive and corrects the complicated young woman. This film jumps between tragedies and chaos in a New York hospital in the late 60s with dizzying consequences. Barnard Hughes is lovely as always (also a great stage player). An 8 out of 10. Best performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big fan heart when he put Vanessa Redgrave in the 1978 Oscar ceremony, but he is a good writer. A real ensemble cast that works wonders down to the smallest role. This won the best script on Oscars, and Scott was nominated. He should have won for this instead of PATTON the previous year (which he also was brilliant in). Look this out!
