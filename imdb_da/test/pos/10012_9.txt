My wife is a mental health therapist and we saw it from the beginning to the end. I'm the typical man and can't stand chick flicks, but this movie is incredible. If you want to see how it is for a person going through this type of battle, it's the movie for you. When I saw it, I found myself sad and others like him. *** Spoiler *** In addition to the fact that all individuals in the film, including the people of the mental institution, were the actual people in real life, it made it more real. <br /> One must look for someone in the mental health profession!
