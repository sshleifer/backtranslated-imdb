A lot of full movie with Muppets created by Jim Henson & Co has been made, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also includes "The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Muppets Take Manhattan". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at that time (nor did I see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of Muppets in my childhood, mainly after Henson's early death in 1990. I finally came to see this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties after hearing the soundtrack. It was surprising that I liked it at the time, and it has not been really disappointing over the past few years. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie passes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, a failed stand-up comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along. The seed is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a leg-bone restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted with this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets participating in them, including Miss Piggy (soon to be Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, when they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain mascot, so Kermit is in danger! <br /> <br /> One thing many people praise this movie is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated "Rainbow Connection" in the beginning, and several good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's prison road song, "Movin 'Right Along" and "I'm Going To Go Back There Someday" sang an exciting ballad of Gonzo . "Never Before, Never Again", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, the only one I am considering is weak, and their romance seems terribly sudden. Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just as they are on television, and some of them provide a lot of humor, including Fozzie, which makes its first appearance in the movie and hopes to try to entertain people in a restaurant with its stand-up, and Well, if you are familiar with these famous Muppets, you need to know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors appearing briefly in the movie may also be funny as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as "Insolent Waiter." There is also no 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the movie that they also did well. <br /> <br /> Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time seeing any of them since watching "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppet films made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw the movie that had never happened before, when I watched movies or TV shows with the popular puppet characters! Not only is the movie very fun, I also think it is a little too dark and cruel for Muppets, as I said in my review of it! However, I cannot say that I think the same of any of the film's predecessors, including this one, was released twenty years earlier. "Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the pile, and since it has so much to suffer, not just for children, it is understandable. I very much doubt that there is much left to say about "The Muppet Movie", which has not been said at some point in the last thirty years, but today it is still good family entertainment.
