'Boogie Nights' uses his protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America's shameful past, which consisted of an unexpected rise in pornography and thus resulted in an abundance of destroyed youth. Its main character borrows from a wide selection of genuine actors who engage in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by Hollywood celebrities and all too often exploited by the press. It seems to be the kind of high tale that might appear on an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are enormous as it is another valuable asset on his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives great talent to all people on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. After knocking out with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the sly Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director offering him work. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star representing the leading "actor" in most Horners films. With newly-won successes, Eddie is told to invent a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler was born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is primarily based on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', which played Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is undoubtedly the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: ordinary biographers. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography - the filmmakers really thought they could compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and fascinating atmosphere. In a sense, the film's director - Paul Thomas Anderson - implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a free and artistic film about a period in American history, as dirt was actually both free and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so clear that we soon feel that we are reliving the first hand of the era. Not a moment passes by, where we are not convinced of the time spent in the movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone was not happy with the set of Boogie Nights. Before the film, Anderson repeatedly went to Reynolds and asked him many separate times to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role in his career publicly disowned it before being nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddenly closed. A year before, Anderson had little title disputes over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought it was more negotiable earlier. He lost the fight essentially, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his movie by mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> Casting the movie is one of its finest aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson regulars are here, as well as a very top-cast of first timers. To name a few of the more famous stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the whole film borders right down to Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who surprisingly convinces in his role. Wahlberg, formerly known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary features to portray such character. This is his best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to capture his audience and take full control of each scene. When Jack Horner first meets Eddie, Anderson uses slyly stars in the background, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as fine as it may be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long track shot that follows Jack and Amber in a nightclub, where most characters are first introduced. It reminds me of the discussions about tracking shot in Robert Altman's "The Player" - it seems so great in Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style is quick in the way of Martin Scorsese, where shots slide around rather quickly but never seems premature. Incidentally, Anderson refers to two classic Scorsese shots - the final De Niro mirror number from 'Raging Bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young growth director who is remarkably mature in history and direction, despite his age. While his first feature film, 'Hard Eight', was noticeably clever and sharp, 'Boogie Nights' is even more so. "Boogie Nights" began as a love effort on Paul Thomas Anderson's account. After filming the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic to so extreme that it almost seems real. Boogie Nights refreshes us with its free content that occasionally borders on pornography. It is only much more sophisticated than such waste. It is a fiery, wonderfully modern masterpiece that is so mind-numbingly explicit, as it is wild and stylish. Probably Anderson's best movie and among the biggest - and most important - projects of the last decade.
