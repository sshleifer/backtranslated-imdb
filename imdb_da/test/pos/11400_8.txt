This is not so much of a review as it is proof that it has been proven that the Academy rewards money, not artistic achievement. And I have to say that I am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members has left this from the top 250. Boogie Nights are powerful, raw and gutsy through script, direction and acting. Very few films can claim this triple crown.
