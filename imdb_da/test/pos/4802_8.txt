You know I've seen many crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. But it was great to run out of time. <br /> <br /> I guess what made it so good was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such great chemistry. The movie in the first place is really fast, but does not lower enough to even notice, which is also good, we do not want to get a heart attack, lol. Regarding their plot, plenty of other things are going on to keep you interested. Lau has some beautiful good moments when he uses make up to unfold people from the underworld. The film also has the best oriental support cast since the "Flying Daggers House". <br /> <br /> The movie is great because it is so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. Absolutely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and excitement pact in for one, 8 out of 10
