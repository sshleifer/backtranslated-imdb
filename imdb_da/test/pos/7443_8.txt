The movie is really cool, I thought. It sticks to the original game quite well, and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such high detail, it's incredible. I thought the movie could have been a little better if they wanted to give you some more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what hangs on you this movie. <br /> <br /> The CG is beautiful, I don't think they could have done a better job graphically wise. Every little detail, the way they move, how their swords look, everything is perfect. The way they make the characters looks almost like they are real people. The music was amazing, and I found it entertaining to listen to how much it was remixed from the original game, with new instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys quick action and a good story. I would definitely play the game before I wanted to watch the movie though.
