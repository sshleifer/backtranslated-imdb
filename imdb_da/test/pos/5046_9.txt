This movie just won the best movie award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It's American title apparently is autumn spring. The action is amazing. The story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life is about him and eats it up a bit. Anchored by his best friend (and partner in not so serious crime) he puts people on every occasion but still often reveals his heart of gold. His long-suffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life-changing decision that is heartbreaking to see. The decision of the story is beautiful.
