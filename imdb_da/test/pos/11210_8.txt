Reading some of the other reviews of this movie, I was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it. But overall, I have to say that it's one of the better movies I've seen from any number of genres or countries recently. More than anything, it avoided many of the typical traps of recent international cinema, such as taking beautiful pictures of landscapes or being "hip", "fun" or imitating American films like pulp fiction. The film is unique in many ways. First, it is a film about relationships where sex does not matter (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about two men's relationships with each other (also unusual - not a "buddy movie", no gay excitement, no ego / false competition). It uses little dialogue, but communicates a huge amount. It is a simple story, but filled with complex details that are easily understood by every human being and universally in their relevance. I didn't find the movie dark or depressing (everything seems like this if you watch Hollywood Happy Ending movies all the time), but rather a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin is gone, you see both his sense of relief that the cousin is gone and yet remorse that he pushed him away. Who has not felt such ambivalence - when losing a friend or lover or in another situation? It is rare to get these kinds of real human emotions on film in a non-cliché way. As for the culture, or it is a Turkish movie, I think it finds the very difficult balance between being a 'Turkish' movie - about realities that are more applicable to the place (the greater the struggle is to do it in a Turkish city ​​against a European, the greater contrast between country and city) and a universal human history that should not necessarily be stopped in Turkey. At this time and age, when people around the world use culture and fetishism, this film does not try to entice us as' Turkish 'nor does it attempt to convey it as a' hard reality 'or' that is how Turkey / Istanbul IS '. And yet they are cultural elements there. I think the comparison with "lost in translation", as someone did, is quite good. Everyone, at least in the US, rages over that movie. Personally, I thought it was mediocre at best. It was well laid out by anyone as a vague story that supposedly had to deal with 'disorientation' that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Though the film should be humorous, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear (even for a "lighter" movie or comedy, it is necessary). And I found myself treated to a typical 'Orientalist' story of the foreign Americans abroad. Go back to 'Remove', as if the thought that this is bad play or too slow or has no plot, sorry but people who say this by nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human, no offense. You don't have to be a movie aficionado or cultural know to appreciate this movie. This movie will be two hours of your time well spent!
