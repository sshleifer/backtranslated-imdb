Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player where the teacher holds his finger over the pause / play button. At the end of the age group lesson, just spend 5 minutes to pause and play on the DVD and encourage students to shout out the answers to "What is this?", "What happens?" there? "," What's wrong? " ? "or another question that evokes answers from the lesson's new vocabulary and grammar. <br /> <br /> Because everyone looks at the TV, they are usually shy student vocal. Because the DVD can be started or stopped at any one time, it's a perfect "filler" for the awkward "between" times while students leave and arrive. <br /> <br /> I tried other DVDs, especially "Tom & Jerry" cartoons and Red Skelton DVD's is, but no one else was as good as "Mister Bean" to keep students' constant attention.
