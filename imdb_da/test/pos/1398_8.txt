Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce) purchased by Roger Corman and released through his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman must cut out his initials on it by having one of his skinny (Dan T. Miller) fix some additional gore recordings before he has released it in the States. L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining tale of the island of Dr. Moreau. It's 1891, and Claudio Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a couple of newly escaped prisoners. Claudio comes across the star Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the crooked Edmund Rackham: a man capable of manipulating researcher Joseph Cotton to make the local native population amphibious deep-sea creatures (they resemble a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Deep ) by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives. <br /> <br /> After discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses the amphibious creatures to decay their treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter who has a mental connection with these mutations. In a memorable scene, Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. Claudio discovers one of the judges he has befriended has turned into a gill creature, and then all hell destroys. <br /> <br /> Filmed simultaneously and in the same place as Zombi 2, Richard Johnson didn't even have to change suits between movies. The house where the experiments take place is the same house that Johnson uses to perform experiments in Zombi 2. Speaking of economic filmmaking! <br /> <br /> The extra recording includes a few bloody behemoths (way to go Roger!) and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell makes his best pirate imitation. Everything missing is parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
