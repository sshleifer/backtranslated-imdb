The surface is one of the largest tvs. series I've seen. The play is amazing and the grandiose enchanting. Each episode hardly left me waiting to see the next one. In particular, I thought Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a fantastic job ... he's a very talented actor and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Surface has just made a season ... once again, the public has hit me down. It is difficult to understand that a great performance like this would be canceled while crap reality shows continue year after year. Anyone who decided to cancel this show really fell on the ball.
