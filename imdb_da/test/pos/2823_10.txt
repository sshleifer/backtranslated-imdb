This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more frequent in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the leading actress appeared. I think women might think of this behavior, but I don't think they are about it. The dark scenes added the evil feeling to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners fled. I was hoping that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it didn't. Maybe it's more realistic. Life seems to be running in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed that runs up the hill.
