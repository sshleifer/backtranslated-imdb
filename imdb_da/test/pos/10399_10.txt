Beyond The Clouds is a ghostly, beautiful, elegant work of art. The general softness of the light in which this film is bathed will cause you to touch the screen. The harvested mood was only achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or to put it another way, an old man. I know of no other movie that captures and uses softness of light and seasonal mood with such awesome quality as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all people in this movie are beautiful unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blonde bimbo, that is. The dialogue does not matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. Some movies exist just like visual experiences, this is one of them. Don't disturb if you want "simple entertainment" this not for you. <br /> <br /> I could regret the visual perfection of this movie for several days, but I don't. If you are at all interested in filmography, photography, filming, etc., watch this movie.
