Very good movie. Very good documentary. Very good to see the pest detectors humiliated and found out that they were bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swine, their single-parent parents, community and environment raised them as. <br /> <br /> <br /> I tip my cap to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent man on a form of 911 commission or investigation? We need its integrity, perseverance, intelligence, clarity and spirit that fights the rich game of world politics and great business. All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, bugs, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Today comes a real rain and washes all this foam away from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of the right rain. The people who control this land are animals. They must drown. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking at night is scary business. The inhuman howling and tiling is of detectives, in murder on a Sunday morning. In Pat McGuinness's fiery spotlight, they look awful, terribly guilty and ready for a fair and dreadful drowning. It is exceptionally satisfying, in a world where the puns play a good game to see justice done, and to see that all narcissistic felons drown like the pathetic human rats they are. How does it feel that you are inciting, abhorrent, snaky fingers in the law? How does it feel to have your rich prosecution, your rigged confession, your rich detective work figured out what it really was? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it twists like a knife, you miserable, an eye nothings.
