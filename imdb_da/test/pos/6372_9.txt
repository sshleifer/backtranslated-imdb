A great show. First, for those people who don't like it. Don't like it, so don't see it ... <br /> <br /> This is (was) a great show. Better than according to Jim (my favorite). It shows a real family household (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes peach). They are loud, they are messy ... I can sympathize with pulling all the garbage into the kitchen. It happens in real life. Black as "The Gateway to Hell" and everyone laughs like dogs over the fast food boxes. It's a "been there" show .... You know what's coming, but fun to see because you've been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work well together, an admirable enough show to warrant a DVD release. Mel Gibson's "Safety videos" was also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, really deserves a DVD release (doesn't deserve to be canceled too).
