I was lucky enough to watch this movie at a festival last year, and one and a half had expected it to be released. The fact that it was shot on a digital video camera has probably hampered its success, but as I understood, it was never the film's intention to make it look like the movie at first, it was more about the story, the characters, and their relationships. Isn't that what movies should be about? But it had a quality in the textures of its visible appearance, suggesting that May Thomas is on something we should be aware of. For independent film producers and producers who have a talent and lack money and drive, one can learn a lot from watching this movie, technically it has everything for it, the use of light, music, etc. By far anyone else is considering digital movies I've ever seen, and therefore it is worth much praise. The actors' beliefs are credible to a point, if not suffered during the game, I felt that there was much more in there, more depth, especially from the male leader John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really disturbs me as a filmmaker myself is that the film is in black and white a need to cover a multitude of sins than if it were color? Do we have more to learn about the development of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful, affordable film production?
