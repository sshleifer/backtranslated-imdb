I saw this drama with cable tv. Although I only saw two series, I love this drama. I'm waiting for several series to be led via cable. Although it describes the horrible, absurd situation of a prison camp, this shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know whether they can survive or not, but kept their hopes strong without being discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know this movie is not realistic as another war documentary, but I don't want to blame it. It makes me believe in the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> 'Private Bill', especially this episode touched deeply in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is his connection between past and present, also symbolizing eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory framed in a circle.' <Br /> <br /> Like other victims of war, he lost his lover by irresistible fate. I am immersed in her time and memory as if I experienced the same thing. <br /> <br /> He suffered a great loss, but he has a pure passion for studying. He began his study in the camp, his joy of realizing, <br /> <br /> I think his engagement in the studio was about to keep him. <br /> <br /> I saw it several times, but the importance of this movie was never faded. Every time I saw it, I feel the same deep feelings. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful and harmonious. I'm sorry I can't listen to cheese.
