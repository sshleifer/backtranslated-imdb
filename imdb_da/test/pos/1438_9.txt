Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra in this film shows that when he wanted to put the effort in, he could act. The end is a little schmaltzy, but at present it is understandable, the study wanted a good ending. The graphic character of the heroin addiction (groundbreaking for the period) is a plus. Add the amazing soundtrack and you have one of the great American movies.
