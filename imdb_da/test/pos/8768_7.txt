Excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings once again shows that he could really experience a storm. This time he is a defensive plant trapped in a terrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly gets interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from California to NY. There is a devilish plot of a group of wealthy 5th colonists to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known to play in the community's upper echoes that were involved in chaos in his long career as director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the film implants at the end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' friend, we do not see what happens to the rest of the gang, many of which represent the upper crust of society.
