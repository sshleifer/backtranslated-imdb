At first glance in this movie, the camera's angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will drill you to tears or make you press the stop button. Surprisingly, the story emerges and is played through the screen in a way that I feel most will relate to. I scored this movie at 7, but as most would feel, it should be a 10, you will understand as you see it because it is rare for a movie to be in touch with a person's feelings and how life should appear of a TV set. Most movies are trying to leave you in awe of their special effects, twists, etc. This movie acted a true hand showed a good movie backed by an Alabama style story that most would notice was a good waste of a few hours. Wish I had put the popcorn maker on after all well done!
