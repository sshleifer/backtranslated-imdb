I was surprised that "Forgiving the Franklins" didn't generate more buzz on this year's Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the laughter of the screening I saw was so loud that you could hardly hear the movie. The film has some good actors and a story that really makes you examine wider issues. You know small issues like religion, sex and truth. Lots of comedies seem to rely on the same old corny-constructed situations many leave you thinking "I know they've torn it from some sitcom". This movie goes out in its own unique direction. I really think Jay Floyd did a great job with a tight budget on this movie.
