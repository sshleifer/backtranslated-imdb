I watched this movie on its opening night and enjoyed it. I would probably have had more if I had not sat by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately I haven't seen it yet) and kept talking throughout the case. He said the movie sucked and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators did a bit of fun genre with the movie. In each horror movie there is always a certain character depicted. If they weren't in the movie, you might not look too much. Brand Features: <br /> <br /> "Lead Character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The Lead Character's Boyfriend": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "Lead Character's Sibling / (Soon-To-Be) Reformed Jerk": Nick (Chad Michael Murray) "The Annoying Sluttish Character": Paige (Paris Hilton) "Characters Just Looking Good": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) <br /> <br /> With these signs it makes it a little predictable who will die and who will live. Of course, you know who wants to do with what I've just written. The movie can be predictable (actually I had a really good idea who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still fun. It may seem silly (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted campsite that wasn't there in the beginning?) At times, but it's very easy to see. Comedy and Gore was the perfect amount for weak skinny movie-goers, it gets gory, don't misunderstand me (less than "Final Destination 2), but it works very well. So finally this movie wasn't as hot as the fire went up but the temperature could still burn "wax".
