I loved it, it was really cruel and disgusting. I thought the human meat tear was thoroughly provocative. The way in which the depicted human crucifixion about Jesus Christ was truly interesting. Tears of limbs and jaws were terribly brutally cruel. Don't look at this if you have a weak heart, you wouldn't be able to stop it.
