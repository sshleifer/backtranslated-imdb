When you think of 'Oliver Stone', the movies that come to mind will be his greatest and most controversial, such as Platoon, JFK, born on the fourth of July or Natural Born Killers. Talk radio does not normally do that. It's actually a really small movie. More than half of the film takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station speaking in his mike. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's greatest films and should NOT be missed. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a sign study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-taking radio show host who says too many things and begins to get in trouble with his boss, his lover (s), his fans, and even some Nazis. He doesn't like his audience and calls, and many of them don't like him (eithor it or like him but have no idea why). But in the end he says on his show: "I think we are stuck together." <br /> <br /> See Talk Radio even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies. You may be surprised. I was sure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
