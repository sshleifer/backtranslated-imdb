Paul Mazursky's Tempest - Interesting, strange and strange movie about a mid-term crisis. Seen in NYC and a distant Greek island with John Cassavettes as world famous architect who decides to escape. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and a lounge singer (Susan Sarandon). A beautiful transfer of this 25-year-old movie on DVD but without the extra-not even the theatrical trailer. Tones with great scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip. Raul Julia and Gena Rowland round out a strong cast. This latest DVD release is worth renting.
