I saw this movie with high expectations, but was a little disappointed. Although I like this movie and was keen on the story, I didn't find it moving and think the ending is falling flat. <br /> <br /> The story consists of the friendship between a man who runs a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policeman. The location is a quaint Korean village. <br /> <br /> This movie is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. But I was not eventually moved by a film depicting a man who is so loved by a woman, but does not even give her the choice to enter her life. In my body he is a sweet, noble loser. Good Points - Excellent play by the two chiefs, fun snapshot of the village life. Cons - Flat finish <br /> All in all - good but I prefer before sunrise and after sunset movie (or is it before sunset and after sunrise)
