Because this show was cut early, I never understood why before I recently read the story behind the series. I felt that this show never got its taxes as one of the biggest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always supposed to have, if not with the original A team being thrown in Anyway with the cast incorporated into the story or a long-standing cameo, perhaps at the end it reminds it of the late colleague Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This caste gave so much to bring happiness to us who are growing up, they deserve a last raise as the series ended openly because they beat the series, reason enough. This crew and throw made us aware that children are the essence of being one of the good people, especially when we see how screwed up the world is today, I think a milder version like the original must be taken in use. I've already read the previews and I know it's not the plans, but if it's something for DVD movies, I'd probably buy it. I really don't understand how crappy shows get series finals, but this amazing show that still runs regularly today and is likely to be seen more than some of the current sweep shows today, we will not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf , and the A team because those kind of shows carry through the time, I'm almost positive. These acquaintances, whom you see about detectives, will not even be remembered in 10 years, so why not bring something back and show the people what staying power is about and how these old shows are really about.
