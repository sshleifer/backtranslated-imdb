Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show set up a great situation and the protagonists had to sort it out. Unlike these, the hero (s) were not left with an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It was also made clear that the 'good people' were in a dirty profession, where they sometimes had to pull some unpleasant things. Imagination, wit, acting that doesn't always take itself too seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons is, I'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - BANACEK aside - which did so well a job taking the viewer and grabbing their attention just outside bats. The authors excelled by creating very unlikely, if not impossible, situations, which the characters then had to find an explanation for. Explanations, which often took 90 degrees, become clearly unexpected, but for all that still made sense. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was a little underutilized, but when she was on the screen, it was not just for eye care. She was quite competent in herself and stood up to the two male leaders when she felt the point she was entitled to. A rarity these days. Sullivan? If he was not in the ward, he would work for the KGB or the CIA. He is the kind of cold efficient, ruthless type. He knows how the world works and understands what it can do to get the job done. King? It is clearly a game for him. The one he excels to and which he parleys to ideas for detective / spy novels he writes as his "real" job. He is probably the most fun to look at the three, even though they all have their moments and often too. I agree that the possible spin-off series with only his character lacked interest in the original.
