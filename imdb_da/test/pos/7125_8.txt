There are few movies that have made me wait and wait for release more than this. This is the latest movie from The Dead Gentlemen Group responsible for the original Gamers movie and the Demon Hunters films. This group has not been terribly active over the past few years, but this film is a definite reason to try to keep things going. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a group of players trying to end a campaign run by a GM, frustrated by his group's neglect of his story. Using some new blood, they are trying the campaign again, hoping to finish this time. <br /> <br /> This movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie environment and a great improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game, just as the original movie did, but on top of that, this film shows a dramatic improvement on special effects that launch it over the simplicity of college movies. The action is pretty decent, and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, many of the jokes are in jokes, so if you're not a gamer, you can't find the movie as fun as others. So, therefore, I give the film an 8 instead of the 9 that I originally thought of. Any case, if you are a gamer or know about gaming, check this out, you will enjoy it.
