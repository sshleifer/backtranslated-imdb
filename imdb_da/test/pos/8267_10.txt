When Precious Bane aired in America, I was stunned by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I immediately went to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful and that went out of print right after I bought the book - even though I've seen it online a couple of times now. I had also hoped for the Oscar that was won by Janet McTeer and Clive Owen's immense popularity, the BBC would obviously get this fine DVD production ... I can't believe all those years later we still have no DVD. It must be the only production ever created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on the BBC - you have the money to give us fans here. Get this on DVD, thanks!
