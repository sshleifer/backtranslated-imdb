This little movie is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American weapons culture, divorce and marriage; yet it manages to be sensitive to the problems that surround each other. Kathy Bates is "Amazing" Grace Beasley, and as a character performer in staggering reach, she brings her remarkable comic talent to the earth this unusual movie she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comic talents such as Dan Akroid as Max, her former lawyer and the background of downtown Chicago and England, the story is just exciting enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a closet gay singer murdered by a cross-bow killer in Chicago. His officer-lover Dirk Simpson, played by the amazing Rupert Everett, must overcome Victor siblings, including Lynn Redgrave, who will approach a tribute museum and team up with Bates and her dwarf sister-in-law, Maudy Beasley, to find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The whole cast sings at various points in the pursuit and is excellent, esp. the talented price and assets. This amazing story, both fun and bizarre, is one of the most off-center movies. Cameos by Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael will tell you how bizarre this movie really is. Strange, fun and off-center, but with a good perspective on people with any kind of difference.
