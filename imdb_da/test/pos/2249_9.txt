Being an Israeli Jew of natural sarcastic character as well as a lover of diverse and independent cinemas, I always enjoy seeing a movie that takes a sensitive and respectful view of the Holocaust while being original and unusual . While I haven't read the book ?? or for that matter heard of its existence prior to watching the film ?? and therefore, as other reviewers can comment on how they are stacked in comparison, everything is enlightened, gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on it. <br /> <br /> To the label Everything is enlightened a holocaust movie would be to do great injustice even if it is undeniable about the holocaust. So it would feel like a comedy or a travel movie, even though it's about a journey and is as unusual as it moves. Everything is stated is about Jonathan Safran Foer ?? played for minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've seen him yet, with a poker face that doesn't show anything and reveals everything ?? a young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts traveling to Ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide through Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. What is fascinating about these signs is that at the beginning of the movie they look like comical relief to balance Wood's character of melancholy. But both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the movie and prove to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin shows himself as the grumpy self-declared blind grandfather to be the finest dramatic achievement in the movie. <br /> <br /> Aside from the movie's surrealistic character and characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, the delicate filmography and the cold contrast between the beauty of the landscape and the horrors of history is what did everything that was enlightened , is a strong and moving experience for me that Alex and his grandfather get us a very different and original point of view on this painful topic; Several excellent films such as The Gray Zone and Downfall have already given us the view of the lower rank Nazis presented as people who are not necessarily fully aware of the moral consequences of their actions but are caught up in the reality of war. Everything is enlightened presents a point of view that is rarely dealt with before: Alex's point of view is a young man's birth many years after the war, which sees it so hardly more than cold historical fact that has to face horror his own people? and maybe even his own family ?? was able to. The change in Alex's attitude ?? and his grandfather is ?? against the holocaust and against the Jewish people in general, the film makes a fascinating and original study of character development. <br /> <br /> Everything is illuminated is a great direct debut for actor Liev Schreiber and one of the most original and unique films from 2005. It is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the Holocaust and others world War.
