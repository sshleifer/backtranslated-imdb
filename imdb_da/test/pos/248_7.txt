This is certainly an excellent 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors led by Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away," Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and was in love with Rusty Parker was a dancer in his club with Phil Silvers, (Genius), "Coney Island" who was a comedian in this picture and also worked and danced with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun" played the role of a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker should be his top model. Jerome Kern's music is heard throughout the picture, and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the theme music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the World War II box office, which kept the minds away from the war that took place at that time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits, and their career exploded on the silver screen for many years. Great Musical and a movie you don't want to miss, this is really a good classic movie. Enjoy
