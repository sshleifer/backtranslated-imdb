The three Stooges have always been some of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts they have made. I love all six of Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also star many other amazing actors and actresses, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, the three stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and are the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> One of the most hilarious Three Stooges shorts is Men in Black. In this short is Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, Little Billy Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. The actors acting by these actors are good especially by Jamison and Roberts. There are many fun scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion, this is one of the most diverse Three Stooges shorts. I recommend this to everyone!
