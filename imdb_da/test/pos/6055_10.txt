I first saw this movie in the late 60's and trying to see it every time it comes on TV, which unfortunately is not often. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will be at least once a year. Jack Webb lives as Louis Gossett Jr. in an officer and a gentleman, an incredibly good performance as a paris beer sergeant with the classic screw recruitment, and the story of this one, but dated, touching and acting very well. And with real canister heads in the cast, it also helped with the film's realism. It's a great movie with top-notch acting and a great story. See it if you have the chance - it's worth the time!
