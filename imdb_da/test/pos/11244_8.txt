This is a good show despite many negative user reviews. The purpose of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun of this show is to see the two men try to reach their goals. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to hate the show for various reasons, but I think they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to get chickens. Well it's not, it's a comedy show, and the whole point is to make you laugh, don't teach you anything. If you didn't like the show because it doesn't teach you anything, don't see it. If you don't like whole clubbing stuff, don't see it. If you don't like social work, don't see it. This show is a comic show. If you are down by watching others pick up girls so it doesn't make you laugh, then be careful not to. If you're so disappointed with yourself after seeing this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "fetch" girls, there's no reason to hate the show, simply don't see it!
