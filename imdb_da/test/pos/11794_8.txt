People watch movies for various reasons. This movie did not have the big budget, there are no special effects, no car tickets and there are no explosions. In fact, reality does not have many of them either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a real movie about very real people, none of them are perfect in any way, but together they are put in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different, and which in turn makes the order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology as I am neither an expert nor the full extent of my own brain. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for the characters. It is full of a whole casting of wonderful quirky folk music. <br /> <br /> Within the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland Detective Michael Hayden's life adopts excellent and he continues to develop the character throughout the film. Excellent play, very trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny couldn't have been thrown better and the report between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' boosts the contrast of their characters. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed the curvy landlady, Mrs Ramsay, I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are several of these wonderful characters, but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy them.
