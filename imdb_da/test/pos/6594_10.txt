Considering the movie as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would not recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known skateboarding figure herself) has made a movie that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic conditions that this sport arose and gained wide appeal. In addition, his film is quite personal: Peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon acts as both the informed film researcher and the participant subject involved. In this role, he is a quintessential "participant observer" while gathering a large number of personalities integrated into this movement and those deeply influenced by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a unique stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the tale (by Sean Penn) and interviews utilize a rather genuine, untouched form that is akin to the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of pseudonyms. The film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a prolonged sporting music video hardened by an archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place and circumstance.
