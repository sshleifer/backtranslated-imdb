If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. In fact, it is an overlap of four and a half hours, but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart is worth doing as Claudius. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze how clear "Hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order set by Bard. Every movie version of "Hamlet" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to draw all of these aspects of Hamlet's character along with Shakespeare's full script. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Hamlet kill Claudius right away? Hamlet says, "I am very proud, vigilant, ambitious ..." Hamlet is very concerned, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder) or his mother's marriage with his uncle, but also and mostly because Claudius has usurped the throne belongs to Hamlet. He is furious with his mother to marry Claudius (marriages between royal family are not unknown, for political reasons), but that her marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself self. He is therefore impotent to do something about it. And that's true even after he hears his father's ghost war revenge. He cannot just kill the king or he will lose the throne by doing so. He has to "get out" the king's secret and here's the tragedy! Currently, Hamlet has been successful in showing Claudius's guilt publicly, having the opportunity to kill him and not. WHY? He wants it all! He wants revenge, the throne and Claudius' soul in hell. Hamlet surpasses itself in classical tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his extinct. He kills Polonius, thinking that it is Claudius, and the rest of the play spirals down to Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius, and Hamlet's final death.
