Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a nightclub in NYC and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After approx. 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to find a note from Carl that he needs "some room" .... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Jo immediately puts the daisies in the blender and press the button. Shortly afterwards she starts a journey to find Carl somewhere out west, for she is "committed" to Carl. But when she finally jumps him into Texas, Jo puts himself near his home, first "hopes to find traces of his decision to leave. She meets a beautiful sculptor-neighbor (Goran, can't spell his name! But, Jo discovers her attraction to her. When she teaches Carl, she can have a new boyfriend, she decides to consult with a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). is a very imaginative, rather humorous look at the marriage pledge, it is quirky script and offbeat style is actually contagious, Graham is just great as the twig woman who has difficulty letting go. The rest of the throw is quite nice, but with Goran the beautiful one as the sexy neighbor, the scenery, both in New York and in Texas, is very nice and the costumes are fresh and fun. comedies and independent fi lm, this is made to order for you. It goes to another beat that is most attractive but still delivers in the ultimate happy end category.
