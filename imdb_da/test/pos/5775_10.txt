This movie from what I remember was such a great movie! I watched it on TV when I was 11 and couldn't remember the title of it. If I remember correctly, I think it was a Christmas TV movie special. One of my friends at work and I discussed it several years back, but none of us could remember the title. But we almost remembered the whole movie. No one else at work ever remembered to see it! Thank goodness someone on a tv movie site replied to my post! Now I have fun working to find a copy of it! It's great what you can remember as a child, but this movie remains absolutely alive in my head ... even after 28 years. And I think I saw it only once. Maybe it's because I am the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I have babysat and work in day care institutions that it was stuck with me. Regardless of the real reason, it has remained one of the movies that I really want to watch last !!! If anyone knows where to look online or has a copy, let me know. I would love to see it again !!!! Thank you very much! I seriously tried to write this and it says my comment is not long enough. So I have to write more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who was in a Christmas story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea of ​​where to find this, I really appreciate it.
