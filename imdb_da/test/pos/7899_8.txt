Let's see what you know what to expect when setting up a post 1990 Corey Feldman movie that is probably tits, weapons and cars. that there is more to this movie than just naked ladies (it is sad to say), because it is primarily people who get themselves killed in a number of unusual and, as the name suggests, often "mysterious" ways. I love crazy horror and I love this movie. If you don't, you probably won't. But I think it's worth most people give it a ride, it's not so crazy that it destroys your weekend or something. All in all, if you have fun, fun, a bit of loving love and an 80-year-old childhood star, you're in the mood for, then you've come to the right place. it's a cracker !!!!
