I've seen this movie many times and I never get sick of it. It's about a man coming out of the closet that he doesn't know he is in. Kevin Kline's character is a teacher, and when one of his former students announces Kline's character is gay, the people in his city begin to speculate whether he is straight or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder if he is indifferent or homosexual as well. The actor is absolutely fantastic and hilarious by all the cast. I found the movie very fun and heart-warming. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while you see it. I recommend this movie to anyone you want to see.
