This was the first leading job of Sebastian Gutierrez, author of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers and it was a doozy. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson in the kidnapping case, and the chief of police (Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a senator's (Hal Holbrook) wife. These two are an excellent couple when they work together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / murderers have lovers Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and the ultra-modern Carla Gugino (Sin City) along with a few partners. They kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run their accountant all over the city before they get the dough. It goes quickly from there as new turns come. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can't go to the toilet or you'll miss any" excitement. To be honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there was more of the movie that the security guard saw in the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but hey, it wasn't part of the captain; just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely make several movies together. A treat: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: Then fill me up. Detective Friedman: This remark can be misunderstood as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. I came to where I'm pushing paper and playing well - I've never fired a gun before I'm only in this job to prove to my dad that I'm not a sweep. I give decent head so I was promoted to all the worthy candidates, all those men, all equally gifted at fellatio, but there was a gender quota to fill. I am also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but I find it hard to show it. Did I skip something? <br /> <br /> Damn, it's great dialogue! Gutierrez not only manages a good movie, but he can also write! <br /> <br /> And, I said Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
