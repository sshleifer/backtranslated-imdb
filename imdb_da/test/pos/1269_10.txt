An excellent debut film for the director of Batman Begins comes after, a movie about a man following other people to inspire characters in stories he writes. A man follows him, he decides to move on, and the man turns out to be more than he commits. <br /> <br /> Using a cast of non-actors and uncle, he writes himself directly and produces and otherwise makes this movie alone on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you would expect. <br /> <br /> For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, bumps and shakes with time, this is definitely a movie for you.
