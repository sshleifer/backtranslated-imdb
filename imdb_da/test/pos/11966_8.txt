I wonder if I could sit through a full musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or other countries that for nearly decades propagandized films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (like this documentary point) that just reflect dark, cruel times during Stalin and life behind the iron curtain. It is fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the kind of clowns and rebels with music on their side trying to please the masses more often than not firmly in the socialist walk of life. A movie actually seemed quite impressive, called the Jolly Fellows of the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip (s) I saw that movie, I would bet it was one of the only works that actually went out of itself and went into just wild, manic, make-you-laugh kind of fashion. But as this movie shows, if you were a filmmaker who wants to entertain, it is better with a "message". <br /> <br /> Through interviews, some occasional quasi-dramatizations (by Russia / Germany / etc kind of motion picture association) on the censorship table and clips, you get the full picture of how it was - both behind the scenes and on the screen - just to make pure entertainment for the masses. Some of the movies (well, most of those who apparently only screened over 40 years in those countries) did a good deal of change, but for what purpose really? You are also drawn into the culture of it all, how it differs greatly from the American way that 'if it works, do it while they are warm' attitude. But at the same time, perhaps out of this repression, some interesting, funny and (from what I saw) movies were made. They could have been quite typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses, under Stalin's bold but demanding conditions, such as the life of tractors. It is even more jealous of a story, even though we are shown how it was in the 60s, the last wave of musical comedies such as rock and roll and pop tunes finally struck their airwaves. <br /> In short, some good things ... but only if interested, really. I was shown the film in a class on documentaries, and half of the class fell asleep. So be warned on the one hand, but on the other hand, if you look for it, it can make a truly rewarding trip to European film history.
