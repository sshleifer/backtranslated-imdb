One of the best memories of my childhood. Must be on DVD. It caught everything we grew up in the seventies - peace, mellowness, floral power and great acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the final peaceni hippies, with long hair, peasant blouses and belly bottom (they resembled a Katherine Ross (ala "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story").) <br /> <br /> They made us happy with jokes from the daisy "chucklepatch", gave us lessons about being cozy through conversations with the crooked garden squirrel and entertained us with music from their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Fat" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show will be in a time capsule from the era that would also include "The Yellow Submarine," "Arrow to the Sun," and Marlo Thomas "," Free to be ... you and me. "Also" sunshine "and" point. "<br /> <br /> And last but not least, the theme song:" See you, see you, hope you had a good time, ah have, Glad we must say good morning to you, hope we'll see you again, see, see you, happy that you could stay awhile ah ha, hope we'll see you again, see you, see you.
