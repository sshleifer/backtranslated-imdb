The EGG as written and directed by Richard Bell may have a few too many stories to tell at the same time for a 102 minute movie to succeed completely, but there is such a good sense of engagement from the side of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends want the movie to work - and so does it. Yes, aspects could have been finesse if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent film from Canada, this is a tender, gentle, humorous, very touching tale of vulnerability and communication and engagement. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very well-choreographed opening, we are voyeurs on a family dinner where, of course, something has gone wrong and results in a father and two sons departing in a car and having an accident where one of The sons are killed. With an introduction as such, the mood is set for the surviving 18-year-old Pip Son (Paul Anthony - looks too old for credibility as a teenager) to devour his family and live on the streets. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle) a male prostitute who gives Pip food and desire, Jenny (the very fine Carly Pope) who rescues him from a bashing of her associate Derek (Ryan McDonell) and becomes romantically entangled with Pip and Dad Chris Alan Cumming) in a well-presented sympathetic role as a priest. It is Pip's 18th birthday, and his father (Serge Houde) tracks Pip down to give him a gift from his late grandfather with instructions, the gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday. Pip, though drinking too much and full of anger, binds the tape recorder, but keeps the tape and begins listening to his grandfather Jason's words (voice by Ian McKellen), telling his own 18th birthday in World War II in France, where he (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded medic named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also amazing) and reflects on his one night marriage with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of 'Queer as Folk' fame and a fine singer and actress here) for something to live for during the war: Jason offers help to Macauley while he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for him two men at the end. The Spirits between Pip and Grandpa Jason gather every time Pip listens to the band and leads Pip to ultimately change his view of life and love. Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a hustler that is being changed by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine movie debut) who simply wants to be loved; by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; of trust, Chris in both Pip and Clark sets in a good shepherd's way: and by a feedback to the car accident, where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from a violent act in his father's father just before the accident, but failed to do so and opened his deep guilt and resulted in misplaced anger, mirrored by his grandfather's lost experiences. Each of these sub-panels contracts at the end and creates a sense of closure for each of the involved. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this movie that make it seem like a big budget production: the musical score by Bramwell Tovey is done by the Vancouver Symphony members, Kevin Van Niekerks movies are suitably atmospheric and the general Quality by performing this Canadian cast is very fine. Although Paul Anthony handles his role well, throwing a very young teen in the lead role would have made the story a much better way, and Richard Bell, with only another movie 'Two Brothers' on his resume, gives a young talent see. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a valuable film and deserves attention. Grady Harp
