Gimmick, as it was, of this 1934 Paramount comedy are the six comedy performers, paired in three man-and-woman teams, all of whom are together. W. C. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as small town Sheriff and Innkeeper. Field seems to have brought the latitude to inject lots of its own unique assortment of misanthropic, surrealistic comedy in his part, and it seems wonderful, especially where he is allowed to make his famous pool table routine, an expression that is totally welcome when it is fun. <br /> <br /> At first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to imagine a movie to be worn by the subtle home comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to wide, jokey Vaudeville patter of the great man and wife comedy team George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because of the parts George and Gracie are given in the manuscript. They are there who are freeloaders hitching a trip to California at Ruggles' and Boland's honeymoon and consistently finding ways to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while each holding a cliff side for dear life. / Burns and Allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters prove to be a perfect way to care for their widespread, greater than life's comedy characters into a real world setting - people's comedy reacts to them in a credible way proves to be as much as a gold mine like Gracie's famous naive delivery itself. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his accomplishments as the discerning banker "Pinky" Whinney. He is wonderfully subtle and underplayed, and draws laughs from lines that may not even have been heard in another actor's hands. The scripture is wonderfully witty all the way through, and most of it is a perfectly expanded comedy of frustration, with our sympathy with the poor Whinneys who can't get a moment alone, and the added bonus is that what frustrates They are just more premium comedy material from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For those precoders out there, there's some rather suggestive material in some of the most entertaining scenes when Whinney is trying to get over to George just why he and his wife will be alone for a while. <br /> <br /> There are a few signs of a hasty production here - occasionally the slash, one of the most obvious drop sets you'll ever see in a movie (right up there with WC Field's own map "The Golf Specialist") and the knot in Field's tie changes constantly. These do not disturb me and they should not bother anyone who enjoys the movie. "Six of a Kind" is a really little known gem and one of the funniest movies I have seen for a while. If you think about whether to see it, the answer must be yes.
