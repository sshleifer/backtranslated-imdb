To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was dead wrong. This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a city that is cursed by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. The residents gradually begin to become dangerous and heavily occupied with something to do with spirals, and some of the residents actually begin to become living things, they actually have some kind of spiral within them as a snail. <br /> <br /> The movie was a huge, random, sour ride angry with romance and drama. Kind of like a twisted drama. What makes this movie disruptive are the ways some of the people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one of the dads has a garage full of household objects with spirals built into them, a girl took her extremely long hair and teased to a crazy big spiral style, a child was slowly turned into a human snail a man could twist its body in a spiral shape, a woman tried to cut her ear open to get cochlea inside and a teenager ran over herself so that he could twist about a car tire and a child filled up in a washing machine so he could become a spiral . Another very disturbing part of this very well-syndicated is the atmospheric tone and style in which this film was shot. The camera's angles add to the psychotic and twisted history, in other words, a very good filmography. The overall color of this image gives a slightly demented story. The coloration is a mixture of lime green, yellow and slightly orange and special effects with some spirals are excellent. But like many Japanese films, this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. But with all spirals and strange events taking place in the city, it is difficult to keep an eye on the relationship between the two teenagers. But somehow it is very irrelevant, more like a used story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral-occupied city. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes very different and bizarre foreign films. It has just enough wackiness and insanity, it touched me.
