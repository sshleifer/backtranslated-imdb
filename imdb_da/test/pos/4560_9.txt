Sean Bean returns as the Napoleonic hero Richard Sharpe in Sharpe's Honor, the fifth film in the series, and as always Patrick Harper and the rest of Sharpe's chosen men are together for the ride, but this time Major Sharpe is in serious trouble. <Br /> <br /> Under the influence of Sharpe's sworn enemy Major Ducos, a mysterious lady named La Marquesa has accused Sharpe of rape. Her husband arrives at Sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a double. The double has been discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result Sharpe becomes the primary suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle when no one in the British army than Wellington and Major Nairn is considering Sharpe other than a rough ordinary with little or no honor. He has given a shambolic attempt and sentenced to death by hanging and Harper and the elected men have no choice but to look at when their beloved commander goes slowly to the gallows. <br /> <br /> But convinced of his innocence Wellington and Nairn hang another convicted prisoner in Sharpe's place and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and La Marquesa himself for not only proving his innocence, but to find out her reasons for hitting him in the first place. <br /> <br /> Daragh O'Malley, Micheal Byrne and Hugh Fraser co-stars with glorious performances by Alice Krige as La Marquesa and FÃ©odor Atkine as the Serbian Major Ducos, in what is another exciting, swashbuckling pass through Sharpe's eventful journey through the Napoleonic War.
