I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the fascinating plot, great characters, excitement and shocking twist ends (all against the scenes of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coast) are never old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysteriously as his true identity unfolds. The action is great and trustworthy; viewers are trapped in the network, which develops between the man-made man, the monstrous wife and the prominent stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I've been searching for a copy to buy for years - I think TV movies aren't being released for video, unfortunately. Great movie, watch it if you can find it.
