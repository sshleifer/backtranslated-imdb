Probably the best comedy for a long time. keep you laughing nonstop! plays are good and there are many hilarious cameos that Ben poses as a great guitar guy. The reason was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy makes up for it. I can only hope for a successor because it seems like they can still do so much more. Even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, I would be increasingly in the end :) Also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie !! I suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and clearly suggests it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should also buy the album, the songs are so captivating and fun, the music on it is also Top Notch.
