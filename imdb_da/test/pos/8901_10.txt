After another attack in an empty village, the Viking Timanah's explanation to his counselor Cryptograph misunderstands that "fear gives the wings to the occupants" and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly. They decide to chase the master for fear in Gaul to learn how to fly and make them invincible fighters. Meanwhile, Miss Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, is sent from Parisium to the Gaulian village to become a man, and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the youth. The stupid son of Cryptograph, Olaf, listens to a conversation by sweetheart Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Returning to the Viking City, Justforkix meets Abba, the daughter of Timanah, and they fall in love with each other. But the Machiavellian and ambitious Cryptographer plan to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. Ultimately, Asterix realizes it's not fear of giving wings, it's love. When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite cartoon, and I read all the Goscinny and Uderzo stories. This feature shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. Romantik Justforkix and the beautiful Abba are lovely, and the situations that Asterix and Obelix get involved are fun. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Astérix and the Vikings")
