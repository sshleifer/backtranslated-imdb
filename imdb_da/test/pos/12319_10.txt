Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for the desert island. There is nothing "brilliant" about this movie. It warms rather warmly and invitingly. The audience is invited to a party, and like any good party, the joy of the guests comes to interact and what you learn as you move from one to the next. With excuses for Joyce, the film's title highlights a series of ideas that keep the audience away. The movie is not horrible. It's not depressing. It's a beautiful look at a time that is over, within which people grow up, and others are down. Some are frustrated and others are quiet. And all around, always present all night, the people and the parts of people are laid to rest. The words that these exquisite actors get to speak are perfection and are set to the Irish brogues music, an auditory feast, especially for us flattered Americans. About the lack of gloss I mentioned above, I take it back. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. It speaks quiet amounts about ?? Reach everything. Some lovely snowy evenings, rent this movie and just let it happen to you. No fight raises, no cargo tickets, no dinosaurs ?? just movie at its most sublime.
