Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons containing Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits whether it is rabbit season or breath season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up "pronoun trouble" with Daffy always sacrificing Elmer shotguns, resulting in his beak always being dismembered. Then there is the rabbit's cross-dressing, which always gets Elmer in his love-beat mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the category of author-instructor team because of these hilarious hunting trilogy comics I have been laughing since I was a kid. And at least two of them end up with Daffy's exclamation to Bugs: "You are despicable!" Can't better it!
