"Opera" is a great movie with some wonderful and imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is drawn by a murderer who forces her to see him murder all she knows by tying her and tapping needles under her eyes. This idea of ​​the needles stems from the fact that Argento does not like it when people cover their eyes as they look at his movie. "For years I have been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the goric moments in my movies. I film these pictures because I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away. I thought of myself: "How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to see the most cruel murders and make sure they cannot avert their eyes? 'The answer I came across is at the heart of what "Opera" is about. "- says Argento. Lots of excitement, wonderful movies and brutal, bleak m haven't caught it yet, give it a try.
