Sonny Chiba, everyone knows, is the man. In this film he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands and won (interesting guy, look him up). Anyway, Chiba only kills a bull in the movie, but it is a memorable scene and as liner notes, right up there with the zombie vs shark scene in Zombi! The movie also offers plenty of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to start, though I don't think all that is true. This movie is the first of the Oyama trilogy Chiba made and recommended for fans of martial arts. Finally three nice little lumps; Part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appearing in the opening sequences, and that's because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!
