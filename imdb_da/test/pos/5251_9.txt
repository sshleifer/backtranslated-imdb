When I read some of the other comments, I have to agree that some (very few) are missing from this brilliant documentary about one of the 20th century divas (up there with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa) are justified. Because it was originally a 6-hour plus-TV documentary about his career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Much more comprehensive and with greater insight into Amalai's inner world. As for the subtitles of her songs, I'm all for it! Although the music, voice and performance can be - is! - universally, there is so much poetry in the words that just ask to be translated. I think this was a deliberate choice of producers. They are aimed at the 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, USA, South Africa, St. Tome and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora worldwide. As for the lady herself, she did not live to see this abbreviated DVD version of the documentary, but she got an example of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And it seems to have been to her taste. Very very.
