It's the kind of unknown and forgotten movie that you dream of discovering when looking at old videos. It's a fantastic comic gem with great fun writing, embedded in the amazing selection of characters, a wonderfully inventive and fun musical score and witty, light-directed Montgomery itself. This is one to see again and again. Montgomery is a part-party actor who is awarded by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutant home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. Although the premise is pretty preposterous, the results are fun. Montgomery is the perplexed plant, Ann Blyth is a wonder as the romantically occupied, terribly serious debutant and parade of cartoon character from the veteran stadium actress, Jane Cowl's lawyer to Lillian Randolph's maid - are all amazing. <br /> <br /> Oddly, it has only earned an Oscar nom for Sound, as it deserved top nuts for direction, script and musical score. <br /> <br /> DON'T MISS IT - it's one of Hollywood's best.
