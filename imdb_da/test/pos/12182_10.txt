Personally, I loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me so I rented it and saw it. It is fantastic! The music, the actor, the story lines the feeling, everything ...... well apart from a minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to the books. I watched this movie before Interview with the Vampire, and before I even knew that the books existed, I was shocked to find out how many people actually hated the movie. I quickly picked up that the book's fans were not at all happy with the adultery and didn't want to be hypocritical (I hate Harry Potter movies due to lack of book loyalty). I was quiet. Eventually I downloaded "The Vampire Lestat" and immediately understood why everyone hated it. It's quite different (The Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Damned of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before I read any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read the book, watch the movie first or you'll hate it. If you have read the book, you have every right to hate this movie.
