Lights of New York was the first all-speaking feature film. There was, of course, The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927 as the first feature film with built-in synchronized dialogue. However, this film, released in July 1928, is almost untouched for its place in film history. It was started as a card, but gradually became more dressed until - at 58 minutes - it was accidentally the first all-speaking feature film. It opened to a mill house race and to Warner Bros. surprise, made over a million dollars. It was good money back in 1928. <br /> <br /> The reason is quite simple. Two country shavers buy naively into a hairdressing salon on Broadway, which fronts as a speaker for "The Hawk", a gangster. When they learn the truth, they can't afford to come out because the younger barber, Eddie, has all his mother's money tied up instead. Kitty is the younger razor, and gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) is looking to turn his older boyfriend (Gladys Brockwell) into a newer model - Chorus Girl Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman is killed while trying to stop Hawke's men from unloading a shipment of bootleg spirits, and Hawk sees it as an opportunity to hit Eddie and thereby get Kitty to himself. <br /> <br /> This early talkie is full of fun for the enthusiast of these groundbreaking works. Of course, the plot is elementary and the dialogue stemmed, but there is something you can't see much of in early talkies - background music scoring. The Vitafonen was originally used for this very purpose, and they still use it for musical accompaniment with the dialogue. And there is song and dance number! The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show which movies could never do before - music tracks. There is even a wild-eyed emcee with a little heavy makeup back from the silent era that is a hoot to see. <br /> <br /> The Vitafon couldn't go outdoors at this time because of the static camera boxes, so the scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated - and cheap. The green looks like something out of an Ed Wood movie or perhaps a high school production of "Our Town". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, as Hawken's throwing boyfriend, delivers his strokes. She is a true trooper considering what lines she should deliver. To Hawk - "So you think you can have a chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!". Huh? mixed metaphors somebody? And then there are her last lines "I have lived and I have loved and I have lost!" Did anyone have to pay to write this dialogue? Brockwell made a great success with his talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent movies (the evil sister in "seventh heaven") when a fatal accident shortened his career card. <br /> <br /> There is Eugene Palette - the older of the two barbers in our history. His frog mood, natural line delivery and seedy appearance gave him a long career as a character actor, who usually appears as a beaten family member / businessman with a mining exterior and the heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast who still has a remarkable career in film just three years after this film is released. Finally, there is the question of "where is the microphone stored?" Microphones were still stationary at this time and it is fun to find out where they have stored it. However, there is a famous scene where everyone can figure it out. Hawk is in his office and talks to his two handcarters - who seem to understand as slowly as they speak - about "taking Eddie on tour". If you see this scene, you would swear the phone on the desk is a sign in this movie. It is in front and center throughout the conversation. The microphone is probably planted in the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in light of the new sound technology. You have silent actors accustomed to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play for a live audience, but do not know how to get the same impression on a Vitafone camera box and you have dialogue writers either trying writing conversation as compact as they did title cards or filling movies with endless chats. <br /> <br /> Check this out. It's not boring, goes fast and is lots of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I don't expect this to always come out on Blu-Ray, but I hope the Warner Brothers people will add it to the Warner Archive soon so everyone can see it.
