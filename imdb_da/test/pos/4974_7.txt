The violent men are a good western. Perhaps the story is not a sincere detached owner dedicated to running out small competitors out of a valley he needs for his growing cattle - but the film has many ingredients that raise its level and make it worth seeing. <br /> Cast is a highlight. There is the reliable Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former chief officer and now one of the small ranchers trying to stay out of trouble until he's pushed hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is almost always like the crippled grandmother and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays her treacherous wife in one of her usual average female roles she deals with easily (others were in "Double Indemnity" and " Blowing Wild) Brian Keith (Cole) makes it perfect as Robinson's gunman brother, an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch, no matter what. Regular 50's western villain Richard Jaeckel (Wade Mattlock) is also there and ends as usual ( no surprise there.) Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter, who does not approve of her father, mother and uncle's way of dealing with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable direction, perhaps Helped by beautiful and wide open scenes, and a fine and appropriate music score also helps.The inevitable last showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western movies.Every man in his own dueling style stand (note Ford's shoot with his searing arm and aim at his goal in the military way) settle their differences then and once and for all. This is certainly one of Glenn Ford's best western looks, the other only for the classic "3:10 for Yuma" he made two years later. It is probably the cast that sets the film as an "A" rate, and for me it is included in the top 10 list of the genre.
