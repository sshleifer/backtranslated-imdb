Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) must be the greatest video ever made. Dude you have zombies, do and a catchy tune, what more can you ask for. John Landi's mixed elements from the Night of Living Dead and American Werewolf in London came out this video. What starts as a good night for a young couple turns into a date from hell, literally. You have dancing zombies, a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rapping". A cool video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood marked. <br /> <br /> I have to give this a high recommendation because it must be the best music video ever made. There hasn't been another like it. <br /> <br /> Check out "Thriller". The documentary has some "interesting" things in it.
