In my opinion, the director, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this movie. I didn't expect much in the direction of camera angles, sound, etc. But in those areas the movie was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I personally felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so much for these two characters to reach each other. And I felt that the Travis (Franco) character wasn't really affected or changed at the end after Terri committed suicide. Though this is probably due to James Franco's lack or inability to express emotions (of any kind) very well in this movie. I've seen a couple of Franco's other movies, and for me he just can't pull it off when a scene requires real feelings or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brings to the movie is the possibility for more people to watch this movie. On the other hand, Rachel Miner's depiction of Terri was well done and she looks forward to having a bright future ahead. I could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness of her character, which made me feel like she was. I only wish I could have seen more in Terri's life before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> For a short film, this movie was good, but it leaves you in the end. I only wished it could have been a little longer to see the characters develop a little more. In spite of that, I hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future. :)
