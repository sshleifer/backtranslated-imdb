The phenomenon of Helge Schneider tolerates easy description or quick categorization. But for the international audience who was not familiar with him, one could say that he is something like a raw mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding a tape to jazz music and 70's outfits. Although his stage services are already eccentric, his film works are simply hilarious. <br /> <br /> In my opinion "00 Schneider" is Helge's best movie. He comes from the two leading roles - police officer "Commissar 00 Schneider" and killer villain "Nihil Baxter" and also in a valuable minor role as a doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". In the opening scene, we see how modern art-loving Baxter accidentally kills the Bratislav Metulskie circus, from whom he has bought a used Jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of Baxter's hands and killed Metulskie. After reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with support from his loyal sidekick, Lt. Koerschgen, played by an older actor with the same name. They quickly pick up Baxters tracks and interrogate him at his wonderfully decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially fail to gather any evidence. The story wins through many rounds of several scenes that do not always really contribute to the interpretation of the plot, but are hilarious, such as a daydream with 00 (including the most unusual perception of a man's brief-clad steps in film history), a police authority party where Koerschgen comes to rest with the boss and must be admitted and a visit to the already mentioned Dr. Hasenbeins. Baxter is finally caught and trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane. Always worth mentioning is Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays 00's wife, whom he usually looks like in performing women's roles in Helge's Movies. <br /> <br /> So all you people out there are looking for new laughs, I highly recommend this movie. The catch? You must understand German (which I doubt there is an English version around) ...
