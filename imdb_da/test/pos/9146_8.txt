If you love Vampire Lore and are a fan of Gothic horror then you might want to check out Soul's Midnight. I didn't know much about this movie until I saw it and I didn't expect much, but I found the movie to be fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Contributors Armand Assante as head of the vampires Simon, Soul differs from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in St. George and Dragon mythology in a fun new way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but I find that if it was a bit more, they could really have been able to beat home and make things happen. <br /> <br /> If you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then Soul's Midnight is a great choice.
