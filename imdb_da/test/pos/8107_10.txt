Here we have the incomparable Charlie Chaplin disappearing his slapstick past to tackle the serious issue of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He depicts two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran, and the fast and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for a long time because of Hynkel's and his armed gay whims, which routinely outweigh their residents or leave them alone depending on his mood that day or week. The hairdresser is among them, but is befriended by his former commander, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He is seeking refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, especially the barber and the avid young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The principle will be - who will be one of these Jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his peers? We do not have to guess the answer; The shave is a dead call to the dictator, and he is equipped with his image, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military gear. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to Osterlich's country where Mr Jaeckel's (Maurice Moscovich) cousin has a farm and they can live peacefully for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces and thinks of him being the infamous barber. The latter has in the meantime been escorted with Schultz to a podium to hold a speech on Osterlich's conquest. The next ten minutes are pure Chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and degrading greed and hatred. Although Chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naive. He was allegedly unaware of the degree of this persecution and hatred and said he knew the full extent, he would never have made the film because he probably thought it would have trivialized the situation. He has a wonderful support: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as the bumbling herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as dictator Napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with the globe, with just a musical accompaniment is pure, luminous inspiration and shining, is also Paulette Goddard at the end of the movie, smiling through his tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new to it for me. Last night, when I was finished, I sat there in tears. I defy anyone who should not be moved by it.
