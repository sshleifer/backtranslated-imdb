For those inquisitive, this episode is based on Pirandello's game, "Six Characters in Search of A Author" and Jean-Paul Sartre's play, "No Exit" (as evident from the title), but of course with a Sterling twist. <br /> <br /> Five very different people find themselves in a space without knowing who they are other than the indication of their attire. A bell ringing intermittently (perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion?), Which increases the pain in their imprisonment. The novice to the group, a major, is determined to escape while the others have resigned to their destiny. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing but the room's experience in their consciousness, and no one to author their non-existent history, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters of Pirandello's piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this differs significantly from the author's story referred to in the title, the Sartre and Pirandello themes (and many other 20th-century authors) come with absolute clarity. This is clearly a piece that addresses the postmodern perspective of the Cold War era. There is also emphasis on issues of personal insignificance. <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen and still very relevant to the current experience (like Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing a classic.
