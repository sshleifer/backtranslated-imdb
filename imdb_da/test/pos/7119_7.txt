I'm so impressed, really. I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there are lots of beautiful geeky humor. But the film is so well finished. The action is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, while the gamer sometimes thinks I am meeting the gamer, is not bad at all. At times it is even dare I say good. <br /> <br /> When the female gamer who built this non-traditional fighter type character, the usual (min / max) type gets all those additional attacks (seems right, I didn't control the rules) it was cool. <br /> <br /> The sets are great for what should be a fairly low production film. <br /> <br /> The story just moves together. The transitions from the gaming world to the real world are well done. A man who plays a female character will sometimes be played by a woman and sometimes by herself. Pretty smart, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a woman but kept forgetting that he was a woman was good at very laughing. He even said at one point, and the woman went on to play the role (sorry, I didn't see her name up, though she did well.) The guy always tries to "get some", got a little boring, but I think it was more gamer humor. <br /> <br /> There was just so much to like about the movie. Munter. Fun! Very well done, and I say that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and I'm not a D&D player.) As I said, I expected so much less. <br /> <br /> Movies often do not keep my attention, I end up listening to them while working on my computer. This one kept my attention. I can't give a movie much higher praise.
