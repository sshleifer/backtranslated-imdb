Oh, that's an excellent job, to be sure. In fact, there are several of the best scenes in the cinema, or at least in Bergman's cinema, in this movie. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as one would expect. Are these two bad performances? Sven Nykvist delivers some masterful, but unconventionally masterful, cinematography. The script is quite good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film is layered and the pace is uneven, but probably deliberate. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Well, the movie is too bleak for its own good. Other Bergman movies are just as gloomy, but not near this tough one. Eventually, I just gave up and I started to get a little annoyed. I was often hit often during the film, but in the end I did not feel involved. It's a great movie, but I doubt I would ever see it again or suggest it to friends. Or if I suggested, I would be very sure to warn them of what's going on. 8.10.
