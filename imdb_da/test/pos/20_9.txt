The many other comments about the film say it all - just like adding that we showed it last week to about 30 in our Community Cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We would 100% recommend it to today's audience, especially if they can watch it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did. <br /> <br /> The sheer power of the imagined notions of the whole squad was incredible and straightforward spell binding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were really the stars. but all were thoroughly well thrown. For our afternoon group, most of which are "seniors", it was a great influence that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-technological use of camera and sound. <Br /> <br /> How nice many said to see a really good movie that is British: still not dated twenty years on: not filled with blood and gut: not confusing because of bob-over-all-over -the-place camera shots, and back and forth through time history lines: no seedy sex scenes. Such views were even pronounced by some who were younger.
