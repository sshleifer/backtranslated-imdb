I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Happy to see him in a bigger movie for once! <br /> <br /> The movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is amazing with its endless charm; Kevin James is fun, and Eva Mendes ... let's just say she's playing the bitch / sweet / annoying role to the best of her ability. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He was just !! The "doctor" had all the right features, said everything in the most perfect way, and never ever went over the top. The fun parts are fun and the sweet, romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. And no, it's not a chick flick.
