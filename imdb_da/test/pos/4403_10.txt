The Coen brothers have really left this wonderful saga of three escaped prisoners. Although based on the "Odyssey", Homer's old work, you don't have to read "Odyssey" to follow the story. The brothers Coen has woven a wallpaper of celluloid and responsive! The soundtrack is inherent to the film, it is actually as if the soundtrack is the product, and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is used wonderfully and lingers back to the old days when the films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as a fat-haired Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest con on the run, whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, where art you are easily the best Coen movie to date as well as Clooney's best bet. Clooney is good enough to justify a best actor nomination as it is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the movie itself deserves a Best Movie Need.
