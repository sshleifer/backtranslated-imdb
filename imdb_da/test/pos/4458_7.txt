If you like who-dun-its, you will like this movie, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo) Fulci has done. It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone. <br /> <br /> Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was funny, but she was still naked, and he would have jumped on the chance to jump over the bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are being missed and there are several interesting suspects. You need to look carefully to discover the killer. Can you? Don't jump on the first guy, it's too early, and he's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end. What a crazy reasoning he had.
