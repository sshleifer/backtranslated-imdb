When you read about this movie, you will cringe. I've seen it countless times, and yet I crush myself! So what is the attraction here? I think it is the fate of romance for me. I find it super refreshing to have an oddball link between this NYC Jimmy-Breslin-like columnist and a down-to-luck (health-wise) ballerina. You feel embarrassed by Paul Sorvino by his effortless approach to arouse this woman. Like the guy at the bar who can't take a tip. He is a little overweight (at least as a will to a ballerina. Hope it doesn't sound unsuitable) and possibly a little too old for her. Beautiful shift of pace from Greek god's wooing supermodel. Bill Conti score has stuck in my head all these years later, which is a beautiful good sign. But some of the actors are just terrible. A subplot that involves a young Puerto Rican boy who loves Sorvino's character is just hilarious. But the opening scene, where Ditchburn warms up to Carole King, draws you straight into this story. Good luck finding it. You'd think Lifetime would re-air this or even WE, but I haven't seen it for a few years.
