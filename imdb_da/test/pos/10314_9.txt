It may interest people to know that this movie was made without the use of Phoolan Devi himself, and when she finally saw parts of it, she was so furious that she announced that the movie should not appear in India or that she would Cover yourself in gasoline and set fire to yourself. I don't know if it was at all shown or not, but doubt it when she was at that time as a rising politician. Since then I have seen a report that she has been dismissed from the office and charged further crimes from her Dacoit days and has been hiding as a result. Aside from her own concerns, this is an excellent movie that was made more by its refreshingly brutal approach; none of the rose-toned melodramas one might expect from a typical Indian movie. It should be emphasized that concerns about how the messages of the feminist film really are and similar are essentially irrelevant: it is a true story. Her dissatisfaction does not seem to be with what is depicted, but with the way in which the film depicts her.
