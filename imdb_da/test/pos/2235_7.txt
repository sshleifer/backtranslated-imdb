Is it a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it is must-have. Her non-polished plays and semi-nudity scene will delight her fans in the years to come. Current rating (3.2) is too low. The film may lack a good story, and it is not a good sf movie at all, but the play is good enough (and as mentioned before, Jolie's play is nice and raw), the film is shot very directly, with a lot of dense - UPS. The landscape is bizarre. And last but not least, van Damme left was a very good choice. Probably the Jolie lovers would not see her having sex with him. This film has all the potential to become a cult movie.
