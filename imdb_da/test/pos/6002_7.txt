This was a truly epic production that had all the elements you wanted in a fantasy movie. Costuming, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and gave a great experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his TV roles in "Cheers" and "Becker", was excellent in the role of the Golden Giant. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) performed just as well in her limited role as her wife. Other ideas I really enjoyed were James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> This would make an enjoyable children's movie, but it would clearly appeal to adults for their deep social comment.
