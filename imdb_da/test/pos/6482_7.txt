The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in the 1980's New York. This involves battling with the other street band that they directly share a high school class, trying to stay in school, and going to local shows involving bands similar to Dead Kennedy's and called Skulls for their band name. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Plays an autistic child who begins to be tall with all these kinds of things and begins to show them that poetry is really beautiful and if used for what these children do in life can really get things done to work for the best! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although they roll with these crowds of thugs, these children are not the same type of people as this group. They usually rex, and they care about others and really show an enlightened side of themselves. While his sister is sleeping with the head of the gang, she also falls in love with Rex and tries to show him that she is not a dull one. But eventually the teachers at school finally come to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life while the Animals of Sound played without him. But they like to think he's not dead, he just lives his life full, rides sharks and loves to live in the sea. This movie was one of those movies where I was glad I saw it. While it was extremely entertaining, it also had a great message to it. For a long time, the lines that these children had no direction, no future, no numbers looking to look up to, but because an uneasy child came together, they all realized that there were many important things to life, then the locals fought black children or be devastating for everything. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them the beauty of rats, disease and murder. Rex showed them the beauty of almost everything, while some of these things have no beauty involved, they could still see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played an important role in this movement, which changed everyone's heart from depression to see that there was hope for them, and therefore he began to show them; The beat.
