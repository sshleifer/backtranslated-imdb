I consider myself a great horror movie fan. One night I just wanted to rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised at this movie. It scared hell out of me. I can't say that very often. Usually Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends saw it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling. A good feeling if you ask me to watch a horror movie. If you are not unaffected then what is the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was original. It did not follow the normal guidelines for a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine blew me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many are left with unanswered questions that most horror movies do. It is worth the rent though.
