An entertaining first draft of "North By Northwest" has "Saboteur" some amazing Hitchcockian moments (one of the best at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who has not yet seen him wear handcuffs, to give her a plate, he tries to do it, he also loses a knife on the floor and exposes himself even more!) but suffers from a badly selected lead (if he delivers patriotic speeches, Roman Priscilla Lane, makes jokes or trying to look worried, Robert Cummings is wood) and from the lack of really different villains (oh there are villains, many of them, but hardly have any enough screen time).
