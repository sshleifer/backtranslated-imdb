This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges that a disabled person should face in a country that expects perfection to be the head of all to see and hopefully understand. It must teach society's bigots that we are all human, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and healthy body, there are decent people who exist in the world who are not so lucky or maybe we are the unlucky ones . We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are wrapped in our "blind" ambitions and only see it in one light "what can this world do for me !!!". Maybe we all wish we were like Radio, a loving happy person ... who loves everyone.
