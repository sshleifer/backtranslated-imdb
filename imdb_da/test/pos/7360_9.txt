I switched this on (from cable) to a whim and was treated to quite a surprise ... even though it was very predictable, this movie proved to be quite fun ... no big stars but orderly and just fun. With all the overheated crap out there, it's very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then ... and this little movie fits well into the bill. 9.10
