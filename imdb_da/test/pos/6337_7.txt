Episode 13 of the imaginative (excuse the incredible gay) "Supernatural" television series moves Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri, where they have been invoked by an old flame of dean to investigate a series of mysterious murders in their small town. As it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an invisible driver runs down African Americans on a deserted highway ... While the dean is trying to revive his former love affair, more cities are becoming people like road driving. The cause seems to be due to an earlier racial event back in the 60s, causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in the ghost limbo seeking to kill black drivers. "Route 666" is another good pass (which is not uncommon, I have noticed), which contains a few notable aspects of the couple of protagonists who the dean is put on and Sam is admitted for having left college ... killer Truck does not come across as the most frightening thing in the world, but for an hour-long show, it does good job. Not a hands-down fantastic episode, but a solid concept with several horror movie references.
