One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation in crime known as the "mystery of the murder", as the addition of sound to film helped make a more faithful translation into movies of what the audience experienced in original player. And since the horror films were very popular these years, the murder mystery films saw a popularity that was almost the same as that enjoyed in the previous decade (where the first films of the genre were produced). The sought-after playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in killing mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after Warner Bros picked his three-act game "The Wax Works" to create the 1933 horror movie "Mystery of the Wax Museum ". Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his best. In "The Ghost Walks" John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new game. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country home for a reading of his game, but his car ends up in the mud during a terrible storm. The three men are asking for a refugee in an old manor house, which happens to belong to Ames old acquaintance. Inside the house, Wood and Homer testify to the strange relationship between Ames and homeowners, but all of this is a plan designed to impress Wood. Everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder has been done for right, and while Wood and Homer find it all false (after discovering Ames' original plan), the fact that a person inside the house is a real killer. <br /> <br /> As Expected, Charles Belden's manuscript for "The Ghost Walks" contains the classic elements of history's stories of the mysteries of the murderers, as we have the stormy night in an old dark house as a setting, the mandatory group of suspects and touching comedy. But this is interesting how Belden makes the movie a true spear on the genre with the many phrases he puts in his story to play with clich√©s about murder mystery plays. The dialogues are excellent, full of white and light-hearted charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam at the end (it follows the mystery routine of the murder yet), it never gets interesting and entertaining thanks to its clever twists and especially its neat figures. Interestingly, there is an obvious homosexuality that is stereotypical, it is never denigrating, and it is really fun at times. In 1934, Frank R. Strayer was the director of the poor side of the film industry, but his partnership with author Charles Belden would give him a few of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Of course, Strayer is ready to take advantage of his set and make an atmospheric movie that fits nicely with the mood and tone of the story. Pacing is a bit too slow at times, but Strayer knew the power of his movie was on Belden's scripts and making the most of it and letting his throws out the most of their characters with outstanding results. It is determined that the performance is a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer does an effective but retained work in this movie. As described above, the play is filled with beautiful lines that make the crooked characters shining and fortunately, most of the cast plays with this to their advantage. Veteran character actor Richard Carle is remarkably fun as cranky producer Herman Wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the swept but witty assistant. John Miljan is just as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing amazing, but nothing really bad, and the same can be said of June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the mandatory love interest), which is just fine. However, Donald Church is really fun as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it's a pity he didn't get more screen time. As usual with Frank R. Strayer movies, the low budget of the movie is bad, as when Strayer does the best he can, the movie still feels kind of ordinary at times. The biggest problem, however, is the very slow pace it has, because even when the movie is filled with glittering moments of witty dialogues, it moves at a pace so slowly that can become dull and boring at the moment. It must also be said that while they are effective in their roles, Miljan and Collyer are rather boring and average compared to Arthur and Carle, and one wants the movie to be more focused on the comic couple they make than on the main couple. Finally, the end as described above is a kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit must go to Belden to keep creative plot twists to the end. <br /> <br /> One can say that Charles Belden is an eerie hero in the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mysterious films that came out of the B movie studios called "Poverty Row", "The Ghost Walks" is easy among the best (alongside Strayer's former film, "The Vmapire Bat") despite his shortcomings. And while it is definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it is a great way to spend an evening enjoying the way it pokes fun in its own origin as a mystery game. A highly recommended movie if you like the genre. 10.7
