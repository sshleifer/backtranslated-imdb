Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Do you see this movie yourself? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at this time to play pill-hopping doctor on Friday. Thomerson has been fun in everything he does, from movie to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie out of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the most fun is the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the cocaine references in this movie, it would be panned as being politically incorrect today, like Cheech and Chong. Too bad because it's FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!
