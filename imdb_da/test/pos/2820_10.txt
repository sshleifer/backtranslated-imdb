I'm not usually in the dark / psychological thriller type of thing. But SEIZING ME is really a great job. The story, the recording, the film, the psychological themes, the erotic quality and the spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and convincing. Rose plays the exact complexity and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophistication of the power exchange issues. It was so intense for us to see that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through "getting tea" and I felt compelled to take a bath. The story was poignant, but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in a straight shot. (It lingers into the grim and ugly side of people, but doesn't leave you there). I was thinking of the signs and deeper meanings for a long time. I would highly recommend this one. Still be prepared for an experience you might not expect.
