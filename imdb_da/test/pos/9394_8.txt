Hmmmm. I'm a little lost here. I mean, I know I liked Death Bed, I know I will spread the gospel of death light to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you read this, I urge you to see Death Bed, but I can't really say Why. Maybe it's the secret of its charm. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, sort of. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and any other darn things approaching it) by sucking them inside its digestive-filled mattress. Among his almost limitless powers, have the ability to keep Aubrey Beardsley's spirit trapped behind an image to observe and tell the events of the movie. Different people then close up in the Beds abandoned manor (Bed's habit of eating everything that moves, gave the place a creepy reputation) and lie down to have sex or take a nap or because they are not well and are eaten, sometimes trippy dreams first. And in the end, we have the explosive last confrontation between Beardsley, Bed's mother (you may be there) and Bed. <br /> <br /> It seems pretty straightforward when I say that, don't do it - Well, except for the Aubrey Beardsley section. But something feels constantly off-kilter, and the story seems to slip sleepily from one scene to the next, even when linked to cheap laughs or strange gore effects. Imagine Bunel, crossed with Bergman, and then back to suck in a big vessel of Herschell Gordon Lewis. History's tone shifts from horror to adventure, to comedy, to existential meditation without breaking steps - an incredible achievement for a non-budget student film shoot in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all, an amazing little movie that certainly no review can do entirely justice. See it for yourself.
