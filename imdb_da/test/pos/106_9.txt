Besides being a depiction of a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of middle class (?) Indian culture. I think this is a quality that is a little appreciated about the movie. These two genres (ie, deeply meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) blend in as well as oil and water do, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance of almost perfection. Serving Jatin's behavior, family treatment of him, the stunned grandmother's constant inevitable presence, Ashok's obsession with a swami's doctrine: Getting from a culture like India is what I can immediately identify as typical. They have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed. While developing her primary subject, Mehta manages to accomplish this secondary theme skillfully. In fact, much of the humor in the movie, which provides significant relief from the heavy subjects of taboo-lesbian love and gender aspects, derives from this satire of the apparently commonplace. The movie flows from the comic to the serious with great subtlety. All in all, brilliant use of symbolic units (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of Fire undamaged and therefore pure, the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see the sea finally achieved when she gets freedom). Kudos to Shabana Azmi (Radha), the lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. One criticism: The first scenes seemed to be somewhat different for me because they didn't fly into each other very well. Judgment: 9 at 10. No less for a movie with scenes so burned in my mind.
