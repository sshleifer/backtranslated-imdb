My wife and kids were and still are the best comedy series on TV ever made. I really enjoyed it and everyone in u.k is still looking at recaps.The Wayans bros. everyone should somehow be in a comedy show.My wife and children were a comedy, the whole family could see and you don't get that often. Is there nothing we can do to make it happen again? We would do something to get that comedy show back! 1 Damon Wayans must make one back! I really want to like Damon Wayans to star or make another comedy like this of course with the help of the entire Wayans family. I was really sorry because it ended that way and I hope they will be more to come in the future. Brilliant comedy, good stuff! Your real, DezMo
