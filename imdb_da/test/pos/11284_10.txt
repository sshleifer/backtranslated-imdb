A warning to potential viewers of this experimental movie: the nature of the image and the effects is such that this is one of the types of movies that should really be viewed on film, projected. The pixelation created by digital transmissions sucks much depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy films. But since this movie is pretty much inaccessible in any format, I suppose you have to deal with what you can do. <br /> <br /> Whatever is this, the most outstanding artistic endeavor is commercial by the guy who would eventually give us the shadow of the vampire. It is a dark and dirty film of the elements' genesis (as far as I can get from the character name) through a process that is horrific and surreal. The begotten is a very good example of the so-called abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than thematically. And visceral describes it. Not so much thing happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it will put you through are countless. The very repetitiveness of some of the images creates a fascinating catch over the senses. Sound editing and score in particular is immaculate and serves the image incredibly well. Fans of this movie would do well to check out the collections of short films released via other cinema DVDs, experiments in terror I, II and III. Movies like these make me more and more confident that the realm of the spouse is in abstract, abject and non-narrative, rather than in ghostly tales of ghosts and ax murderers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
