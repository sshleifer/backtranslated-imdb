On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve, a nurse slowly ebbing in life, David Holm immediately needs to be presented to her. We do not yet know who David Holm is or why this nurse wants to see him, but her only dying desire is to talk to him again. On the other side of the city is comfortably situated among the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also ruled), and two of his drunk fellows await the new year pleasantly. "Here we can tell just when we are going to drink New Year in" exclaims Holm and supports a finger against the big clock tower that awakens through the dark. He knows a little, though, that he will not be alive to greet it. <br /> <br /> To pass by, Holm gladly recites a ghost story. He had once had a friend George, "a good guy" who was "smarter than the rest of us." On a New Year's Eve several years ago, George has broken up a potentially catastrophic fight to fear that the final man will pull his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom wagon for the next year, make Death's bid and gather souls of the deceased. "And Lord, George died last New Year's Eve!" Fortunately, Holm concludes, and does not bother his mocking skepticism about the man's beliefs. Of course, as a fate, it has an unexpected violent meeting that results in Holm's death, just at midnight. As man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he testifies, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom transport. The driver, a fragile cloaked figure - a shekel clamped in his hand - steps down from the cart and approaches. We are surprised to find that the driver is none other than an abandoned George who is preparing to pass on his horrible duty to this year's successor. Considering the era in which the "driver" is made, the special effects of this movie are absolutely stunning. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the wagon and its damned driver. Even today, the end result is very effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom wagon traveling to the seabed to retrieve a drowned man's soul. Another scene, honestly reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', implies that Holm breaks down the kitchen door with an ax to reach his fleeting wife and children. <br /> <br /> Really tireless Victor Sjöströms 'Körkarlen' is a fine film work that successfully shows Holm's permanent alcohol infusion, his inevitable doomsday and a final hopeful opportunity for redemption.
