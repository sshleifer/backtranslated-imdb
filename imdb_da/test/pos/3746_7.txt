Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle is reportedly ill and has requested that Gerald, the only heir, be present. Gerald goes out to Scotland and leaves his future break behind. A few weeks pass and he does not come back. Worried, Kitty is sending out telegrams, but does not belong to her fiance. Four weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a strange response from Gerald, renouncing the engagement and telling her to continue her life. Not ready to give up his relationship and look for answers, Kitty hopes on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. She follows Edith (Katherine Emery, known for her lead role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam property, they immediately lose something strange that is coming. For starters, Gerald seems to have aged twenty years within a few weeks. Secondly, this once beautiful and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk, repeatedly demanding that they leave the castle and never return. When Edith comes down with a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things. Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman that he was just getting married? Why is Gerald unlike having business? Why do the house rules say that guests must be locked in their rooms at night? Why are guests prohibited from entering certain areas of the property, eg. Gerald's bedroom and a large hedge laboratory from the outside? And what do they do strange strings every night? These are just some of the questions MAZE poses. The film actually does a fine job based on mystery and intrigue. You really get interested in what is going on and patiently awaiting the decision to explain the strange events taking place. And then it happens ... I will certainly not ruin the final of this movie because you are better at knowing, but it requires one of the most incredible and compelling turns I have seen in any movie. It is wonderfully ridiculous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b / w mystery and sends it directly into the Z-Grade schlock area. And yet, it seems that this end is out of place, you won't forget it when you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the end (or maybe even partially due to the end), I really enjoyed the odd bird. It is extremely talky and slowly moving over time, but I managed to keep my interest all the way through. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-hour Oscar-winning art director, and his set of designs is also very interesting here. There is sometimes almost a sound film, with modeling for some of the exterior, some painted backgrounds and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good slot set, there are also secret passages and long stairs. This is also thrown into a few rubber boats on strings. <br /> <br /> A few of the actors are a bit stiff and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of the unclear and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch in spite of being both beautiful and talented. Emery, who is also going to play telling in the framing of shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the exaggerated and cautious aunt. However, my favorite was Michael Pate as the silver-haired, outrageous servant who makes this hilarious upright zombie walk every time he climbs the stairs. Also onboard in smaller roles is Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale is THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course, Carlson has also played in IT FROM WITHOUT ROOM, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks, so you've got a pretty decent cast for genre fans in there. I say check it out!
