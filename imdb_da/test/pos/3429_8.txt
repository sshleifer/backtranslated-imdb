... and this movie simply exceeded my expectations. The fact that it is written and directed by Peter Dalle led me to believe that it was in the style of other movies I am used to (and bored with) seeing him in. No matter what, I went grudgingly to see this flick and that i'm happy about it. These things have humor and depth. 9 out of 10. See it!
