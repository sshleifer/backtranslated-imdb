Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was formerly a champion of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Do Not Torture A duckling. This movie has all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as giallo, but really draws viewers by having every key character with a skeleton in his own closet. This makes you do as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who kills the young boys in town? The young rich woman who is so sad that she sexually damages the final victims, the reporter, who likes to manipulate a crime scene to get a better shot, the city's woman with a mentally delayed daughter, the local witch. the city's idiot ... the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes as a true game to play and solve. The themes of this movie are very bold and finished with the perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have considered making a movie with such strong content, and that is precisely why it is such a satisfying movie (despite some unusual accent choices for duplication) and will certainly bring people to to discuss its meanings long after see it. As they say, they do not say them as such, so take a copy and appreciate an important movie like this!
