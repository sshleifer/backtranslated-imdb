This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You will probably jump on some points and for some of it you will scrape your head to find out. It unfolds its mystery through the protagonist Eve and her psychotic college project by an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to assert herself from murdering her mother, and when Eva agrees to help him, she opens up the pandora's box and releases some very strange things, including Malachi. I don't want to go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. I know filmmakers don't see this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Joly's brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just saw this movie could get some recognition), but I think how Malacha's ending works is something to talk about. I have recommended this to my friends, definitely worth buying or renting the price.
