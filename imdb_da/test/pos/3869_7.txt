Bart Genius While not the first Simpsons episode, Bart He Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There's no gimmickry or theme, it's just your typical Simpsons episode in set-up. It always seems to me that it is an episode that grows on you. There are some elements I don't care about, basically the fiery animation that can be forgiven. But gradually I like this story of the unique. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a live action sit-com on a standard budget to do this episode due to various different sets that show in this episode, the computer bugs in Ms. Melon's class, the opera and so on. My point is with it, The Simpsons realizes one of the greatest forces in animation. The sheer lack of visual limitations to live action. <br /> <br /> At a written standpoint, it is also very intelligent and fresh. The concept is quite unique, and especially the problems facing it. Instead of the ol being sure that the work was too hard, it was just Bart's social isolation from his classmates who failed him (though exploding science experiments might prove otherwise ... which I also think is one of those best visual gags of the series.) The end seems a little unoriginal, largely because Bart runs naked into his room to avoid Homer, was already finished in the shorts, but still fun for Marge and Lisa's short back and forth, if nothing else. /> <br /> Ultimately, it's a very good episode, with lots of interesting new feature in the series, but not exactly perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the now iconic name Kwijybo was naturally loosened on the world.
