I went for an advance screening of this movie thinking. I was about to embark on 120 minutes of fast-paced lines, mindless plot and the kind of nausea that made "The Postman" one of the most vicious screens of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a movie starring Costner, who appealed to the audience's soul. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a movie starring both was actually engaged and captured my own feelings. Not since 'Robin Hood' I have seen this Costner: full of depth and complex feelings. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious act he played with in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors came into this movie with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best movies I've seen this year. No, it's not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic or a deep social commentary movie. Rather, it is a story of a simple subject, illuminated in a way that brings the audience to a higher level of empathy than was possible. That's what I think good filmmaking is and I'm mostly impressed with this work. Bravo!
