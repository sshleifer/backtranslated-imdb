I watched this movie at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema last night and was saddened to hear that Mrs Troche tells us (in her Q&A after the screening) that she doesn't expect to see too much American distribution because of her insistence including all the so-called "homosexual content". It was a great entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that American audiences can enjoy it just as they've had "The Full Monty" so it's really unfortunate and a bit ridiculous that a couple of shots of two boys are kissing it away from mainstream theaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script, and of course, Rose Troche's direction makes this one of the funniest movies I've seen.
