WEEE this is still jolly good fun! As with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young, and then had searched the page for a copy of it. When they finally re-handed it a couple of years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie was good. Well, it's pure cheese, but it's still very fun. If you didn't see MM when you were young, you might not appreciate its value today.
