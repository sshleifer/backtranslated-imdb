I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it's scary and weird. Crispin Glover who always gave a good performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I do not like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and I really felt like his character. All in all, I think the whole cast gave good performances when they felt like the characters were real. I didn't like anything but felt really sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if it was the original ending that the movie should have since it did not finish how I expected it. I was disappointed in the end and I don't feel it did the rest of the film's justice. If you are into scary, strange and really good different movies, go to this one. If you like things that are normal, stay away.
