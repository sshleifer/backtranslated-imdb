This film is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> It is a movie similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hassons Waiting, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic movie Breaking Away, which deals with young adults who are stuck and know they are stuck, with little or no chance to break free. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) is about an intelligent, thoughtless, artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is stuck and waiting, bitter on the world's hypocrisy and bitter on his own shortage on the direction and desire. Will fulfill his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult who is so bitter he has chosen the path of crime. Both end up helping each other rid themselves of their bitterness, which allows them to become unstuck. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, they may be unstuck, or break free, meaning that they both throw into life and her life is filled with the marks of a young "solid" adult: a suicidal, sweaty, underpaid job, raw customers, a former boyfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college degree without a degree, a house filled with self-made art, and of course the new friend whose wicked choices help him save itself.
