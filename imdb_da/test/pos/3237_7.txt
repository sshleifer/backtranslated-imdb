I've just seen this again on BBC Channel 4. It's not Jane Austen's best novel in any way, but the movie is a reasonable interpretation. I suppose the assembly room at Bath would have been more crowded than shown; Maybe they couldn't afford the extras. Also why do everyone close together so that the dancing couple can have an acoustic conversation? I have never heard anything that anyone has ever told me when I have danced, and I suppose it would have been the same in the 18 / 19th century in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can't believe in US / Canada reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film all the way through. The "gothic" scenes are quite wise presented, but you have to read them properly. I'm sure Jane A would be mildly amused by these reviews. One suggestion of nothing, does anyone think that Peter Firth becomes more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa, the older they both get?
