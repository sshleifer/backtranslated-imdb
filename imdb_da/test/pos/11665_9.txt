"Dead Man Walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. All the play is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of death penalty from both sides and pays equal tribute to both. Above all, this is a profound story of redemption, death with dignity and loss of ego. Any movie that treats this courageously and mature with such an incredibly difficult subject deserves a rating of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
