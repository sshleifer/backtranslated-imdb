'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier tapped into a very dangerous and highly qualified mission in Cambodia to "finish the post" of fellow Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly-rated and highly-acclaimed army officer who seemingly gone crazy and defective from the army, set up his own small community and helped by a cult follower of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way they encounter several interesting people (especially Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrible situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The term of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderful and convincing that when the film's end arrived, I was actually surprised at the time that had elapsed. The beautiful movie is probably what was most important to me. After watching this movie, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all things with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible use of natural light, and the shadows, especially in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, become almost vivid in nature, they are so transparent and effective. Another beautiful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and encountered a tiger. The huge foliage of the surrounding lion (leaving as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted gray, the leaves were an incredibly vivid green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really small positive moment in the movie was the big scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the little village while they play Wagner. This could just have been an ultramatologically underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead the Coppola moves the song to an actual part of the scene, with Duvall saying he likes to play it while approaching to "scare the hell out of them". <br /> <br /> The performances of 'Apocalypse' are first class, much has been done by the amount of money Brando earned for the movie and the amount of problems he caused, regardless of which he showed a strong performance for a relatively short amount of screen time, Sheen is excellent - this is the first time I've seen him really get rid of a movie and the duvall is very fun to watch as the loony kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a movie that is currently is so transparent in the pop culture (most people know several election lines from the movie, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al), but I knew a little enough that there were lots of surprises left to experience. not seen the original snow t of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can't compare it to this newer cut, but it's a movie that must surely be experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> --Shelly
