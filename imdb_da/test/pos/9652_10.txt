This is the best French movie of the year! I saw it twice and I found it well both times. I didn't think it was boring even though it was a very long time (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so I obviously didn't have to live the events of May 1968, which marked an extremely important tour of French history, but it's not really something I still really enjoyed the movie. It's actually quite universal: People of my parents' age can identify the characters, and people too can of my age. Garrel seems to understand the young people completely, how they think and the complications of love, and the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe it's because the character Louis Garrel (his son) played is actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well anyway, great movie, no action (must be honest at that time), but such strong feelings that you may not care about it. If you're looking for a relaxing Sunday night movie, don't waste your time on this, you'll be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you like Les Amants RÃ©guliers, which is an enchanting movie close to those made in the 50s and 60s by Nouvelle Vague artists.
