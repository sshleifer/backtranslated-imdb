Based on the best-selling novel "The Dismissal", The Missing Star, the latest film by renowned Italian director Gianni Amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hires in Shanghai to be his guide through China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance manager at a steel factory in Italy, which is closed down and the stove sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the stove is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find the steelworks, where the part has been sold in the hope of preventing a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is not about the journey, but it is a provision to use a well-known clich√©, and on that journey we are excited about an engaging look at China with all its immense beauty and complexity via the excellent filmography by Luca Bigazzi. The film leads us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River, which shows us coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operational, a Chinese mega project that has resulted in the shift of 1.2 million people. The trip brings travelers face-to-face with poverty, crowded homes and children left to cope with themselves. <br /> <br /> The film is about the relationship between Vincenzo and the translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling), who first meets in Italy where his impatience with his translations at a dinner party causes her to lose her job. When he jumps her down in Shanghai, she works at a library and is resistant to Vincenzo's approach. Looking at his offer to help him with his travels in China as a little more than a good paying job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. However, their relationship grows as they move from city to city, her interpretative skills much to prove to help the confused Vincenzo who does not own a cell phone. As they slowly open up to each other, they expose each other's vulnerability, and the film kills in their past and present-day lives, and how they arrived at their present situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's home. In China's one-child policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" when the father of the boy left the family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is relaxed, their relationship becomes crucial for how the story plays out. Castellitto is an outstanding actor (although one yearns for a younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, and his expression rarely changes from a far-off hangout expression. Although Tai Ling brings much of the presence to the role, her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed to me, and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors and gets on the heels of the brilliant keys to the house, Missing Star is a disappointment.
