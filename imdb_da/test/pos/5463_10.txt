As a previous TV editor, I can say that this is just as authentic as it gets. It even led to Letterman's producer (thought to be a source) to renounce (eventually) in real life. Letterman was upset (OK, so it's a goofy thing, it has him throwing softballs on a tire swing on his property, total fabrication), but the most important information is hilariously true from the stupid bid war for Letterman when he decided to leave NBC to Leno problems with an agent who was not ready for great time, but who he let run the show (almost to a disastrous exit) out of his famous loyalty. If any of you kids do not understand the idea why Letterman is jealous of this day, then watch this bond.
