This is one of the peripheral stories told by Animatrix that is not directly relevant to the war that stops. A glorifying plot of the movies, but Trinity, spoken by Carrie, appears in it. It has a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker called Trinity. we see his search, which contains other PIs, only one he meets, which apparently has become angry with his own experience and tries to track down Trinity. In the end, he contacts Trinity, which he obviously assumes to be a man - told in the story and something that firmly puts us in his own perspective despite what we already know - in a hacker chat room and solves a riddle that forces he is busy catching a train. he forgets his hatred, but his faithful cats throw it to him in a moment of ridicule, so absurd is the fun. <br /> <br /> he meets her on the train, but ruse is thus revealed when agents attack; the agents used him to come to Trinity and Trinity tried to release the PIs that were sent after her, which he himself did not know of course and which is not explicitly stated in the animation itself, something common to movie titles, which often hints on lots of interesting back-story, subplots, developments, etc. but do not show you more than the core story and a limited viewpoint to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in this short is in black and white, reminds the music of film noir and the offbeat old-fashioned yet dedicated detective is the perfect lead role for a movie noir title. The trivia section of this title's post on IMDb also provides helpful some references that the title makes to hard-boiled literature, something it also heavily borrows from, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters, etc. that quickly and often engage in challenging conflicts. animated appropriately by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is an enjoyable variation on the usual matrix history.
