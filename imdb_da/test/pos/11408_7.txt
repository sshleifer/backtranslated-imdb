One hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in the small town American, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles for one night with childcare. With the kids asleep and a beautiful home to relax in, she locks the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of spooky phone calls from a stranger say she "checks the kids," Jill panic. Fear of terror when she called. And what the police find is doing the perfect babysitting job in a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. There are no other leading players in this movie. Camilla Belle is the star with a sweet face. The day she comes to babysitting, she really has no idea what the hell really is waiting for her. <br /> <br /> If I was in a house like that, Jill was in. I wanted to investigate everything around. The fridge would be the first person I wanted to look at, but I'm a man and I'm not babysitting. But what I found fun was the size of the house. I thought the movie would be the same if the house wasn't that big? Anyone could be lost in the big house, but this movie needed a massive size house. Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile, but it's like a movie like this, the leading actress needs someone with experience. I didn't find Camilla so good. I don't know maybe she thought this could be her breakthrough role. I like her, she is a sweet girl, but someone to play a role in this movie must be someone how it is different to take it. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't scary. I also found this movie more like a "chick flick". I think the only reason this was released during SuperBowl Weekend was that the boys stay at home watching the game and the girls go out to see this. It also works as a type of movie when girls will enjoy more than guys. But I liked this movie, but for how it is. Girls like like a scared or screaming. This was just a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone likes this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that never succeed. This was at its own level. So I liked this movie. I give it a 7/10.
