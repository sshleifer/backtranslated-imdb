Swinging bachelor Matthau, a successful dentist, stretches with her blonde mistress Hawn, telling her he is a married man with three children. After attempting suicide, Matthau decides to become responsible and marry the girl. Concerned that she should be a "homebreaker", bright eyes Hawn will meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau uses his faithful nurse Bergman to deal with his wife, and that is when things really get complicated. <br /> <br /> A farcical comedy with irresistible leaders often hits the mark, but is not credible for a second. The script asks us to believe that we men are such one-dimensional Turks that it is truly without faith. But perhaps this comedy will not be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny Matthau, the ever so charming Bergman and DÃ©butant Hawn, who basically created the dumblonde girl role.
