"STEP BY STEP", is my opinion, is a pure ABC hit! I can't remember any episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. But I think it was always fun when an accident occurred at school. I always laugh at it. In fact, I think almost every one of J.T. (Brandon Call) and Cody's (Sasha Mitchell) lines were fun. It would have been good if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had stayed on the show throughout her run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it never stops flying in syndication.
