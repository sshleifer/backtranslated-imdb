Words fail me when I want to describe my feelings about this movie (and the successors) ... Does it have errors? Sure it ... Starting with "Subspecies" itself, which wasn't done well enough for a particular effect. So why do I glorify these movies ??? For the crowd of film consumers out there who are more aware of quantity than quality, about cheap fun more than depth, shit as "leaf" (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter), "underworld", "Dracula 2000", "Dracula 3000 "and so on are great movies to munch popcorn and drink a few cokes ... What makes subspecies a superior bet for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic, on the other hand is obvious: The Vampire Self is Romanian, the story is set in Transylvania (the scenes filmed on the spot are more than compelling), and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chases or animal orchestral music. Radu Himself is the source of the atmosphere ... That's how a vampire should look, and so he must behave! Add a breathtaking, dark castle with dark passages in Romania, with some typical Vampiric elements (eg the shadow movement on the walls when the vampires flee) and you have a work of art! In short, if, like you, you are fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be creepy and dark, there is no better place to look than in a subtle movie ... or in the Vampire Journal, the brilliant spin off of the former ...
