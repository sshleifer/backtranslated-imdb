An intense, dark action drama with exceptionally rich support from Casey, Keith, et al. All of which many get the best roles in their career and run with it. The film is strangely shaped - often the activity is slow to let the characters be caught in strange but well-suited seemingly improved dialogues - during the action almost the entire "Machine" is caught in perfectly-delivered humorous monologues - and Reynolds director deserves much to have Reynolds The star goes back and gives them space. And unlike most action movies, you really get to look like the characters, making the 2nd half when their various fate of good and bad unfolds, exceptionally affecting. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - see this and then "Jackie Brown" and you will see what I'm talking about) make this occasional mishap (the evil ones are a bit melodramatic) one of The better modern copfilm, and in my mind many of the overstated modern noirs are superior to "Body Heat" & such.
