This is my favorite Indian movie all the time. There are comics. Salman Khan is fun. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell their own story - doubt whether the stylist has deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie more fun (at one point she looks as though she has a soft one). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the start to the end. There is not a dull moment, every scene is fun, even the songs and dance restrictions will get you in the nail of laughter. I especially loved the scene where Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so happy to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this amazing movie as far as I know A.A. it's not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> See it, you'll love it !!!!!
