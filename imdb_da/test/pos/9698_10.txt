Everything you could ever hope for if your Jackass fan.As always Knoxville & his crew risk life and limbs just for our entertainment. If you are a fan of the series and the first movie, you will not be knocked down as most successors often do. The jokes they draw on each other are twice as fun, cruel, raw as ever, and stunts & dares are twice as hard as any Jackass episode you've ever seen. If your fan doesn't waste time, take it out yourself because Jackaass standards are a 10-in-10 movie just for the opening credits alone, I can't go into details without spoilers, but you have to watch it to believe it.
