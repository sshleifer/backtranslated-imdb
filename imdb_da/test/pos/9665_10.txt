Now we know radu munteans movies, the excellent PAPER WILL BLUE AND BOOGIE, but it's worth seeing again (or finally) this first FURIA, which clearly shows his first qualities. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to see how his beginner talent evolved to confirm him as one of the best Romanian modern directors. Of course, the film itself is excellent - intelligent and professional script, safe-keeping, stylish photography. definitely one of the best - in the most serious and competent sense! Muntean's storytelling sensation is also compelling and poignant - and he actors ... well, they simply rock!
