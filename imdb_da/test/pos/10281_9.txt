Magnificent, original, beautiful film. The action is fantastic, the settings and decors are fantastic (Paris at best - but the real Paris, not the famous settings) and the music will also do. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I just love a lot. <br /> <br /> The best French movie I've seen (and French cinema is very good)!
