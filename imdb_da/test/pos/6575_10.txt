I was one of the lucky people who was invited to watch this movie in New York. It's a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends took care of the tragedy on September 11. This movie made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days. The filmmakers really caught the emotions of the people involved. It was great to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. I went out of the theater that day and wanted to call all my friends just to say hello. I would recommend anyone to see this documentary. I would rate this movie with an A ++++++++++. See it if you get a chance.
