What gives this movie its personality is the knowledge that ultimately it is absolutely true. While it's a compelling and humorous documentary that borders on mockumentary in some parts (are they staged or humorous?), It seems to be a bit long at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun in places it should be and flows relatively well. Reminiscent of Christopher Guests movie, if you liked them or customization, then I recommend you watch this one. <br /> <br /> B +
