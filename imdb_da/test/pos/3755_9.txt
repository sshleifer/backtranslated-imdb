Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member, I have just managed to watch this movie for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say that it has not lost any of its kicks. I cannot believe that Channel 4 has let this disappear without trace, as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic exploitation of the consequences of misplaced loyalty. <br /> <br /> It focuses on a client of friends over ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly plagues the other. As events from both past and present, the excitement unfolds thicker gradually, no different from Shane Meadows' outstanding revenge chiller Dead Man's Shoes. Play, writing and direction are very brave in 1983 and still pack a wallop today despite the central sharpness accents. Yes, it can be put in primary school, but it is worlds apart from everything that is stated by the seller before; I have a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can remember for a long time if you see it - unless you probably won't, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) has chosen to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of Channel 4" - overlooked by whom? This was one of the very first Channel 4 movies (which would later become FilmFour thanks to the success of movies like Trainspotting), so you still need the master print. In those days when you can expand the collector's DVD's of more or less something, it's a bit of a mood that they can't give a movie this great promotion it deserves. <br /> <br /> So if one of Channel 4's flunkies reads this, stop making programs showing people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal, chasing this up film and sort a nice special anniversary edition disk or something, thank you!
