This eloquent, simple movie makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Though a theatrical release has a "made-to-TV" quality. We can award this to director John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live TV in New York City. In fact, he directed the telephony, on which the film is based, "Deal a Blow" on the CBS drama series "Climax". "Young Stranger" represents his Hollywood debut. After four years of resting where he wanted to make more television, he returned to "The Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and a year after the "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> The molding is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (especially good), who play the parents of the title character performed by James MacArthur (his first theater film), who played the same role in his TV release, which was his first appearance on the small screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell to support roles.
