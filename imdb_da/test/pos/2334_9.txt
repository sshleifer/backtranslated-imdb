I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape many years ago and watched it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has a keen sense of humor that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it is very fun. I am very surprised that it did not receive higher ratings. <br /> <br /> It is one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes it's just a movie to be.
