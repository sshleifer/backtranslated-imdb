I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant filmography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was fortunate enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 when he was waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his depiction of the young captain. This is undoubtedly a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American film history. "Charlie Don't Surf". Robert Duval's famous line (the other) does not have to repeat, as it has become an often repeated hymn, and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It's a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
