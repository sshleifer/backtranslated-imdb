This movie is one of my coolest childhood memories. Watch Muppets (in the height of their popularity) on their way to Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing her best as everyone's manager and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a movie who turned Kermit's melancholy ukulele number "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was knocked out by Norma Raes "It Goes Like It Goes". I choose Kermits song every day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless imagination ... one day they find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreams and me!
