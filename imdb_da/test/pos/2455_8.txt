This movie has a very deep look at the relationship between a mother raised in a Christian environment and learning that appearance is everything. She and her son, who recently returned from Vietnam, collide with some very tense questions. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great precise depiction of how it is to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either ignorant of her cruelty, forgetful or just won't be confronted. Jeremy's anger is never feared, and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings that his fathers love him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leading to despair.
