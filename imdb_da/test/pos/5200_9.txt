Bloody amazing. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the narrative stream - how the characters moved from the hopes and ideals of valor through shock, fear, disintegration, desperation and complete extinction. A first-class anti-war film that must have created the very rose in Germany. Not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost. This film was excellent for conveying the removal of command from the ground troops and in pounding the countless carelessness of trying to control untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I didn't know I would have thought it was a Russian movie, it was so fatal. What an uncompromising conclusion. And pieta.
