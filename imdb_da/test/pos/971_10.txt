I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called "big fat lies". Although this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Moreover, he does not just make it fun or get away from anything he does to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was just a great ad for Universal Studios because I liked how it provided an inside view of how it is for kids who don't know how cool filmmaking is . <br /> <br /> It has great music and fun characters. This family / comedy is fun for both children and parents. It has humor, excitement and real difficulties like lying. <br /> <br /> Finally, Big Fat Liar sends a morale: Don't expect to lie to be easy.
