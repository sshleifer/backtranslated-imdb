Otto Premingser's "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been quite risky to film back in 1955 50 years ago (censors today still have a problem with substance content in movies!). <br /> <br /> The leading role was originally offered to Marlon Brando, so shaken by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond. Sinatra convincingly depicts a pro-card dealer and ex-heroin addict returning home to find himself fighting the demons of temptations. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder" Starring James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama). Preminger largely contributed to changing the cinema's face in the 1950s - "Anatomy of a Murder" was extremely controversial as it came out because of both its plot and content (references to rape, women's panties, seduction, etc.) and " The Man with the Golden Arm deals with a topic that is as unstable. <br /> <br /> But Preminger pulls it without being exploitable. This is a precursor to "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and carries more than a few similarities in the form of general motifs to the classic Billy Wilder movie "Lost Weekend" with Ray Milland. These three films are especially the best films on alcoholism that are going on in the 1980s and still remain relevant today.
