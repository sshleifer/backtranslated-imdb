The answer ..... No, unfortunately not. Although the mill and sweep should be greeted as a most whimsical cinematic treat. The drama, the excitement, the romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the film's complex history, which must have been too much for the public in 1898. An enlightening experience, one for the whole family!
