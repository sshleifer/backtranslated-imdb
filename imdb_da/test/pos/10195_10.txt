The combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy action makes Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi movies in recent years. For some reason, which was still unknown to me, this gem was found in a box of commerce, why some worthless people believed it was right to dirty a modern classic by relating to a trading box is beyond me. I have never been so horrific of a man in tin foil and random outbursts of fire. Forget about Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other movies flattened by this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
