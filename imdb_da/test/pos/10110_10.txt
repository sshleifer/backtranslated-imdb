"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological scare that left me speechless. The movie offers some wonderful moments of horrible horror and is extremely scary. The little cast of actors is really excellent, with lead Im Soo-jung being especially memorable in the lead role. Kim Ji-Woon's direction is well managed and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The reason is a little confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully annoying. The action is quite slow, but I was not the least sorry, I was extremely curious and fascinated. The house, where the film takes place, looks incredibly threatening and isolated. "A Tale of Two Sisters" along with "Ringu" and "Cairo" is one of the most original Asian horror movies I've ever seen. See this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
