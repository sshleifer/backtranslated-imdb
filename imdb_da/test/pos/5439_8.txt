Over the years, I have come to be a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson, and he did not let go of this very fun look at politics. The popular television comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has informed the nation with his mocking jokes about the state of the country and the elected politicians responsible. Night after night, he has his fans rolling in the islands; Then it is suggested that Dobbs runs for the president himself. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says go after it. Dobbs flippy truisms flame a grassroots movement that puts him on the ballot. Comedian to President-elect. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds an error in the computer system that counts the coastal coastal polls. My favorite sequence is Linney's meltdown in the coffee shop. Williams is completely hysterical with his quick quips. Others of note in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
