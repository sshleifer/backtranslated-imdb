It was sad that COMMITTED lasted only two weeks in the Dallas theaters. I thought this movie had a lot to do for it. The script was fun, full of subtle emotional shifts, and it had a good message. The action was great. Everyone did a fantastic job, especially with the script's features. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has * expressive * eyes. For that matter, all the actors were attractive! Why it didn't do well in his theatrical release, I don't know - other than the studio didn't seem to have much of a push behind it. But it deserved to do better and I hope it goes well with video. It is definitely one of my favorites in the first half of 2000.
