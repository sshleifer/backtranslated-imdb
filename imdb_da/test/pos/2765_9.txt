I'll be short: I usually hate movies like this poisonous ... but there's just something about this that just pulls me in and won't let me go. Permitted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the play is at best, and the dialogue is sometimes so bad, it's fun), but there are probably redeeming features so it can be seen at the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a cool little plot - it is by no means original, but it is better presented than other movies of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) put pretty decent performances that more than compensate for the apparent lack of quality from the supportive cast (the fat policeman and Coach Quinn really bugged me), and the scripting is licking and witty (though it is bad in places). The bottom line is, but this movie is so CUTE: I've been laughing through it and it has a place in my video collection just because it could encourage someone. You really have to be a kind of humorless drilling not to like this (I DARE someone to sit through without grinning !!!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you want a simple, fun, and, above all, comfortable watch. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
