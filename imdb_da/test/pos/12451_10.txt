How his charter developed as both man and monkey was excellent. Not to mention the scene of the movie. Christopher Lambert was amazing as Lord of Greystoke. Christopher is the soul of this masterpiece. I was so confused by his performance that I could feel my heart pounding. The whole movie still moves me to this day. His depiction of John was worthy of Oscar; as he should have been nominated for it.
