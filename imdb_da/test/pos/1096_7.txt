I enjoyed the movie camera very much. I think it is a bit affected by the Brazilian film "City of God", but perhaps this parallelism between the two tracks that can be followed (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the movies made by Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think it is unreal that he shoots such good films because there are many artists who have no education and can be genius genius. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the soundtrack very much. It is adapted to the pictures. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's good to show how it can be a life in a social neighborhood.
