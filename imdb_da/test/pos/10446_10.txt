"The Last American Virgin" along with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one of the last great teens ever made. It is a desolate tale of envy and untouched love in the early eighties. Very criticized by critics that it was a sophomoric, banal attempt to recreate the magic of the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", these same critics do not acknowledge that the two films were actually filmed at the same time in late 1981 and released with only small intervals apart. In any case, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising depiction of the problems faced by many male teenagers as they reach their sexual maturity. Especially considering the heartbreaking discovery of the protagonist, Gary is confronted with in the end. American Pie This is not. The story is about a trio of male teenagers, and their most failed sexual pursuits. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary succeeds Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility ahead of him. Gary slips into Karen's help, leading to the above-mentioned unexpected conclusion. All in all, as a movie, I find it very successful as a comedy as a commentary on the young men's sexual dilemmas and a remarkable upcoming age story dealing with issues such as envy, pristine love and abortion that are just as relevant today as they were twenty years ago. It also has one of the rocking soundtracks ever made !!!
