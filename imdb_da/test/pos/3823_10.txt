When the new external borders first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to turn down, most of the episodes became just as ugly and without any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best and worst of the series. As the external borders always preach a morality. I want to offer my own. Beginning with the most entertaining for the flop. <br /> <br /> 1. Afterlife: As an institution, the military industrial complex in the United States, both evil and paranoid, is not to mention plainly stupid. However, people of great integrity serve our country and they will obey their conscience even at a terrible price! Ultimately, foreigners need not say a word. Those without conscience are fools who must be held in complete contempt! <br /> <br /> A truly subversive episode! One to be shown on premium TV for everyone to see! This may be a revelation to some, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military! The properties also do not justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. The Theory of Relativity: A good person can be forced to make a split decision between good or evil to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings and at great price for oneself. What makes this decision even more difficult is the strong choice: To be marooned with exotic alien strangers that you cannot even communicate with except through movements or join a group of people you believe will keep you safe from inappropriate dangers even though they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is brilliant! What fuels this spoil is good old-fashioned greed. This episode is one of the most frightening accusations of capitalism, transnational corporations and the rape environment I've ever seen in my life! Unlike real life, justice is served here - and fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless business shock said something to the effect: "We did the same in the Amazon Rainforest War." Alluding to the killing of the Amazon Indians who tried to protect their rainforests from being strip mined, as the reason for killing again literally in the name of the "mastering" survival. Something Darwin never thought to be taken literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: A great stream can be used for good, even from an exotic stranger. This power can be used to heal rather than destroy. More mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he gets enough opportunity for it. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes strong medicine, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. Grell: A foreigner can be a Christlike figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified again, in terms of appropriateness! Basically, good people can be destroyed. Sometimes a person must be experienced, great shame to see the evil he / she commits. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have huge responsibilities! Another genius! As a species, "Do people learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop Number 1: Quality of Mercy: Loose Lips, Laundry Ships! When you are in war, please keep your mouth shut about important military plans. Gee, did I really need to see an hour of soap opera to find out? I wonder if the creators of the outer borders run out of ideas or have the companies pulled out the plug? Dark and ugly, serves no purpose, but despair! <br /> <br /> Flop number 2: Beyond the veil: So bad there is no morality, but this: When you are unlocked at a mental hospital, use some common sense, thank you! This episode is so bad it detours. What an X-Files rip-off! Don't waste your time on this! You will thank me later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that the outer borders went down the pipes towards the end of its run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle they were made at all! Hopefully, other brave souls will one day follow the subversive outer borders tradition of new territory! <br /> <br /> If you happen to be such a bold person, a great place to start is with a unique book: "Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction", edited by Neil Barron! As far as I'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
