"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the movie "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a film about a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar games with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-torn romulans who are distant relatives of the volcanoes. It's an incredibly exciting episode, closely designed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of importance to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode!
