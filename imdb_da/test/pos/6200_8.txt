Sleeper Cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (I see 24, but feel cheated with all the stupid episodes, all four or five seasons so far. Who can keep track as they are all the same. Jack gets into trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and gets back in trouble immediately and so ...) The Sleeper Cell is really well done and is much better. Unfortunately, they were blowing at the end of season two. I can think of half a dozen better endings from the top of my head that would have worked better for the author's obvious goals and not been so designed. Shame on the authors to destroy what was up to what ends a really good series.
