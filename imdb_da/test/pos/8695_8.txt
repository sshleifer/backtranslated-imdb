This movie has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be a Hollywood blockbuster. As I remember (and it's been a couple of years since I've seen the movie), the action starts with a London omnibus filled with people. There is a terrible crash and a passenger dies. The rest of the movie is then told in flashback, where 13 characters who were on the bus got their recent life explored in intricate details. At the end of the film, we return to the crash and find out which of these sharp, lively characters have met a cruel end. Big things, a bit like a good tabloid news story, in the exact, exact details. If only available on video ...
