A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian cinematographer producer director who died in 1999 with almost 200 features for his credit as director. A great deal is used on D'Amato's softcore sex film, including his infamous EMANUAL posts with Laura Gemser. They also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade or so. More interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and effort. D'Amato has lots of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film production, including a story of an assistant who accidentally collects real legs in the midst of the fake while shooting in a 2000-year-old catacomb. Other interviewees include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked a little more conversation about his Stateside Filmirage productions (not a single question about TROLL 2; given that was not the cult movie when it was now).
