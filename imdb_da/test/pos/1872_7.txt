I am firmly convinced that a movie, television series or any art should and would be fully appreciated when the timing factor - as it is written, produced or conceived - must be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is such a series. I remember watching it in the mid-80s on television and the recycle through the video cassette libraries in the early 90s. and laughing loudly and relying on it. It made me buy the complete series of DVD sets and surprise of surprises - the comedy and the moment in the good ol days simply fell flat for me. Even the very popular "30 year experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" did not claim that kind of joy I thought it would. The time factor: for the 80s, this was a show stopper. The main event. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked in age and time! Perhaps the same cannot be said right now, but nevertheless the DVD looks back pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah has been unbelievably good as the heart of the show, with equally effective support casts by Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi hams throughout. All in all, an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the primary times, may not appeal to the younger viewers or first-time viewers!
