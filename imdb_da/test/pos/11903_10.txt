Finally a gangster movie worth seeing! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily was nominated for her role as a tough murder of femme fatale! <br /> <br /> This movie flies like a bird, just a fast paced Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> This movie is just as beautiful and bad. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway still alive! Cast in this movie is then adapted to their roles. <br /> <br /> A really cool soundtrack rides along the side and you are swept into the Spanish soul in this movie. The story is original deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This flick has a lot of fabric and never rests. <br /> <br /> The Spanish brand tire just puts everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a movie Star. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy the ride.
