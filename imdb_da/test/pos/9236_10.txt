Having seen "A Texas Tale of Treason", you feel a renewed disgust for the character of the Hollywood animal. Inside interviews and conversations of all involved in the project, there is a common sense of companionship and rebellion that spans backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to the hard work of the entire production, immortal commitment to the project and the love of the story from the original film and the complete creation of vacuum as it is created. The scale of people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday" was great for me, with no budget, no glory production. There were no trailers or craft services, no facilities at all, and yet everyone involved involved with it. If nothing ever comes from this project, Antstuie Productions has laid the foundation for being a serious, honest company that will never lie down and take it or sell and make a movie just for the money. I want to see that a L.A. director goes through the guerilla process to get a shot. More realistic true life cinema is missing in this time by CG and green screens. The masses can enjoy their entertainment spoon, fed with them in fine, bittersweet censored quiet bits, but there is a large group of people in the world who share the views and insights of the filmmakers that still make films the love of the material or the love of storytelling, not DVD - sale or ticket office. I loved this documentary, and I hope the IFC has cahones to pick it up and fly it, so maybe maybe just one person will decide to download a camera and film some real life so we viewers can even have a temporary understanding of that everyone everywhere is the same, and everywhere else can be a true storyteller.
