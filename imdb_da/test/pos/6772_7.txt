Good Lord ... How it ended in our DVD player, I never know ... my wife thought it was a new release she had missed somehow ... Never it is a few years old and in Danish (I think) ... She kept looking for the English soundtrack ... All in all ... the movie wasn't bad ... Good production values, better performances and a smart story that doesn't go too far away by itself make a tidy, dark-haired ticket from all over the sea! The end will make you chuckle ... actually want the whole movie. Incredibly weird characters that we really grow interested in make a movie that can be worth while ... Without spoiling the plot, the movie's title and DVD jacket give you a good idea of ​​where this thing goes!
