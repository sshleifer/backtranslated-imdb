This was really an exciting and dark episode. Well done, wonderful plays and atmospheric control, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. Together with 'Pusher' 'Grotesque' 'Wetwired' and 'Home' (these are pretty good in dark atmosphere in my case) It seems quite realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever-growing anger were perfectly executed by the great actors. But "Ice" had a problem I got over after a couple of watches: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> Generally, "ice", what 98% of all X Files episodes have: Excellent plays, Intense history writing, gritty directing. All works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
