This is a novelty in Danish film. The mood is not unlike the flashing lights, also by Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new touch. One difference is fewer characters, which gives much more space to be built in. And what characters? The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant, counterfeit parody and Nikolaj Lie Kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unfortunate pairing of the two.
