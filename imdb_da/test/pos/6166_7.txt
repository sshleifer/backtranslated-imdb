It seems that no matter how many movies are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories coming from World War II. It stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of the filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material to base a story. In a direction other than most common films about the war, Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with the traditional big battles of war, does not tell the story of many of its great characters and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the great allies or axis powers. Dark Blue World instead of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations. <br /> <br /> The film does a wonderful job of portraying the challenges that Czech pilots fly under the British Royal Air Force, expressing the frustration that they felt both in the language barrier between them and the other airmen, but also to be prevented from gaining revenge on the Germans until they were trained. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works quite well outside the war movie's arena as a human relations story. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman who complicates the teacher-mentor relationship between the two cursed soldiers. This relationship is extremely well-acted throughout and evolves into almost a father and son relationship on many points. The air battle in the movie is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy and relay commands and answers in an unknown language. The excitement and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, as the excitement of the earth continues, which felt in the air. <br /> <br /> This may not be a movie for everyone. Hardcore War Film Buff may find its exploration of relationships a little off-putting, but it is, in general, an excellent movie regardless of the bellicose element or not.
