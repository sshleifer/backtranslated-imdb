So what is 'Batman Returns' anyway? It was marketed as an action movie, and many people who have seen it seem to think they've seen an action movie - but really there It's not that much, and Tim Burton hardly seems interested in it. People often adjust it to the "gritties" superhero of the late 80's, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns' that seem just a little absurd; Burton's exaggerated performances have more in common with the day-TV threesome television series (Penguin runs around in a huge plastic duck, for the sake of goodness). Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and it is a little closer to what we see on the screen; The penguin - deformed, malignant, with an interwoven history and an underground lair - is a gothic threat dressed in more respectable Dickensian clothing - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC cat cake is certainly the twentieth century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a romantic comedy from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Then click it. The wise but dull secretary romanticized by a lonely millionaire? The following complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is clearly a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through Burton's S&M dungeon. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. <br /> <br /> Like many a romantic comedy, it is centered on the heroine's make-over; not from ugly ducks to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the notions of her (often remarkable) career; She is iconically sexy as Catwoman (Bad Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and revengeful, memorable because she knows how to deal with her whole body. Gradually, however, it is his scenes like Selina that impresses; Almost every one of them is a small cartoon, especially the glimpse of her lonely home life. It is a delicately balanced tragicomic performance and it is in these scenes that the movie really sparks life. Nothing moves me just as Selina and Bruce Wayne dances during the mistletoe to Siouxsie and Banshees, a gun held between them, at the same time empowered and captured by their alter egos, convicted of conflict. Forget the simple sentimentality of the 'Big Fish' or the gossamer feelings of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most fervent scene in all Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-suffering and not a little joke, all in a few short lines and completely nailed by the actors - especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her and finds the wounded dignity buried beneath the truly repulsive long-john's. The villains of the comics of the comics are apparently no more than a shame; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature exposed to its own Eliza Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an "ugly ankling"). It's Burton's most radical - and most fun - reinvention. Christopher Walkens Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains who slip between casual charm and blind-eyed psychosis with unpleasant ease (and is it just me, or is it his company's logo that comes to mind Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask it former Disney animator Burton). <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins - a real action movie - has been highly acclaimed as the first movie to make Batman right; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a shame if it was allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.
