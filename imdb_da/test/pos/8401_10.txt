My God, this was a great movie. Every time we see it, we go to another place for "WOW". Rhett & Scarlett was played brilliantly by Joanne & Timothy. They did a fantastic job that changed the roles of our two favorite heroes. Everybody! It's a must see ..... Don't strip this movie. If you loved Gone With the Wind, you'll love this mini-series. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarlet !!!
