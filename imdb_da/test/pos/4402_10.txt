Not being a fan of Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, anyone in Hollywood dares to make something different. This time it was the zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens does "their thing" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would ever have thought Homer had that in mind? I don't know where this movie fits Hollywood's history books, but it will be in both mine and many other DVD or VHS libraries. It's one of the movies you can see over and over again. The story is excellently written. Clean and entertaining, with a pair of Gumpesque brides with fame, amazing performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and a short but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I want more people to throw some fun on us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack for the rural south. You do nothing better this weekend, go see this movie! <br /> <br />
