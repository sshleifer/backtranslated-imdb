I was never previously interested in this game, although I love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studying some at school. Something about this story and all the unbroken if it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet before I recently decided that I should at least try to see it, and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed too old, not only in his appearance but in his act of the part. The game was hugely cut to fit a more conventional movie length, and I think it must have missed too much when I found it hard to concentrate on it, soon became bored and annoyed by it. I still think Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've seen of the exciting game - to admit that I haven't rewatched the Beeb version yet and can't remember how it was when it first appeared. <br /> <br /> I heard about Branagh's full-length version of Hamlet. Although I enjoyed his very much Ado, I think the Beeb version is much better and I wasn't quite impressed by his Henry V. But I was away from Branagh a little after seeing his disappointing efforts on a musical by Love's Labor's Lost which is a game I like and was so well made by Beeb. <br /> Finally, I have gradually acquired the complete Beeb Shakespeare on DVD, and I soon resumed one of my most favorite Shakespeare plays, Richard II, and was simply thrilled by Jacobi in the section, so It was immediately persuaded to see the hamlet next. What a revelation this game is for me! Yes, it's great, but I feel it needs an actor that you can mimic playing Hamlet and this is for me Jacobi. Amazing. Encouraging to note that although he is older than I understand the character Hamlet was, it does not show while in Olivier it did. Now I notice that he is also in the Branagh version and had a lot to do with training Branagh, so I have to see it to see what Jocobi does to Claudius! I am interested in discovering that Jacobi has trained Branagh as yes, you can definitely see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I have to see it all over again.
