Text taken from the 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide. <br /> <br /> fuckland The title is a proverb based on the film starring Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's attitude and a somewhat less than subtle statement to the secret agenda of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine citizen, an amateur magician associating himself as a tourist visiting the Falklands country, immediately after being reopened to his people. His main plan is to win the ultimate battle by seducing and impregnating the local women who begin with the delicious Camilla, thus spurring a whole generation half argentines. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fishing perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy. (Argentina)
