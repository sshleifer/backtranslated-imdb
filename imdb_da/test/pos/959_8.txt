Well it can be a child's movie ... maybe, but I don't want to let my kids from 9 see it! So the one who says it's a kid movie hmm?! It's teen movie I agree .. so but back for the film it's about a boy who can lie very well .. so good that at the end no truth or lie settle. It's a good movie to watch good acting, I'm voting an 8 for acting and history ... I think the writers do a little lesson with it ... '' The truth is never exaggerated ''.
