We went to the cinema and expect a biggish budget release and got an art house film. The film was digitally projected at about two-thirds of the screen value with sloping edges classic of digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack wasted in the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the movie was the same old historical content we've all seen before, but greatly cleaned to prevent the audience from getting sick. Live action scenes where some of them were, were constantly reused in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised that only 4 people came up to see it, the rest knew something we didn't do. <br /> <br /> I suppose the producers made the movie to recognize the nineteenth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to question whether they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten to try and out of respect for ANZACs.
