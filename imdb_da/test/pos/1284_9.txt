Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspirational writer who hasn't been released yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. Bill picks some strangers on the street diner or on the subway, the subway and follows them as if they were their shadow. Maybe Bill does it to help him inspire himself to write the great novel that he has dreamed of, or get an article of his print in a big magazine? Perhaps it is because it fills Bill's lonely life with an intention and even makes his curiosity a face in the crowd of meaning and substance by being aware of him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to take care of and take care of and be responsible for beyond himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: When you follow him or her to their home or place of work, you stop. <br /> <br /> One day, Bill Cobb, Alex Haw, follows home and instead of following his rule of stopping, he still follows Cobb. Bill will soon realize how true he was with the rule he sat down to follow people and at the same time how wrong he was breaking it. <br /> <br /> Stunningly good low-budget movies made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before hitting it big in Hollywood with its groundbreaking and original movie-critical "Momento", some two years later, it's already become a great cult movie. <br /> <br /> "The following" is actually a much better movie than "Momento" because it is a conventional and easy-to-follow story. Compared to "Momento's", which first became confusing and so when you realize what the movie tells you in the backward story is very complicated. What makes "Sequel" so much better is just that it is simple, but at the same time it has a good influence on those who see it. The movie is far more direct and destructive and you don't have to watch it again and again to get just what it was to try to tell them like "Momento" did. "The following" is a story in a story in a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the tracks you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, it's less than most Hollywood movies budget for coffee breaks, with an unknown name in black and white and just over an hour, 71 minutes long. Hollywood and the film industry outside Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how a person with nothing more than talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases cannot; Make an intelligent yet transparent movie with almost nothing in money and no big names stars.
