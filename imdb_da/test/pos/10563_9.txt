The story was well planned and interesting by itself. But it's hard for me to write the review of this movie without spoiling you. To avoid this, I will not speak the story here. <br /> <br /> I consider this movie a good fit for Sarah Waters book compared to the previous "Tipping the velvet". I read the book first and looked at the DVD later. The film preserved most spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course, due to the time limit, the film seemed to be in a rush for the last 30 minutes to cover Part III of the book. Therefore, it could not well illustrate the scene as they all met in the kitchen of Mr Ibb's place and the subsequent (even the book seemed to me to be a hurry on the kitchen scene). In fact, the film did a great job of representing the story. It's really worth seeing. It's still unclear when BBC America can send this movie. It is a shame. PS: noted that Maud and Sue time were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more sensible, while the former is closer to the actors' age.
