Though not half as fun as "Chicken Run", the new Wallace and Gromit comedy "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (*** out of ****) gives more fun than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created Wallace and Gromit characters, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned stop-motion method of animation - best known as claymation - to create more visually cute characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes of a monstrous mutant hare to devour all vegetables in sight. Entertaining as its capricious story, the greeting's heart is in the imaginative way that Park and Company have carefully constructed signs and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called Plasticine. Essentially, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" required patients' souls to make minor changes to the clay characters of a series of individual shots that merged into a true fitting of joy. Hollywood pioneering claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry settled on the complicated process. Aardman Studio animators managed to turn more than three seconds of usable recordings a day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" was taken five years to make. The bulky-looking characters, with clear prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexes, look incredibly fun with their ping-pong ball eyes and biting mouth. Interestingly enough, Gromit appears as the funniest character, a gracious mouth without mouth, but an expressive inexpressive face that says more than most of the talking characters. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are champion and pooch respectively. As the human half of the duo, Wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue that somehow manages to construct machines that do some pretty incredible things. One of the more fun scenes shows the master and pooch awakened by a system of wrinkles, hatches and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal's half. The current joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his genius from a master. Almost his ideas and inventions are, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit giving him a hand. Our heroes run a pest control called 'Anti-Pesto.' Essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using a ungainly-looking device called a Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their soil and into a large glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit don't kill critters. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace is experimenting with an invention. Mind-O-Matic - designed to transform hairs into carrot hats. This "Frankenstein" meets the "The Fly" approach kills poor Wallace in deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with a rabbit. Not long after, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on the full moon night and creates chaos for everyone like the village's 517th annual vegetable competition. <br /> <br /> Originally, Wallace and Gromit were featured in Parks Oscar's nominated film school project "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, among them "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers "(1995), not just because it represents the duo's big screen debut but it also runs a huge 85 minutes.The first two-thirds of the "Were-Rabbit" contains better gags than the last third, but Park and Company never miss a chance to slip into an adult joke that the kids don't get, but Attentive adults will appreciate. "Wallace and Gromit: The front of Were-Rabbit" is hare-raising fun.
