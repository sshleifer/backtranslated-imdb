This is a truly amazing story, and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happens! If you haven't noticed: It's based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Imagine shock and horror to discover that your own father was once a World War II SS officer. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting story and I'm really surprised that the movie has been rated a miserable 5.3 here at imdb.com. My rate: 7
