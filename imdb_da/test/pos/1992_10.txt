David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" is a well-developed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It solves the problems of a culture linked to technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The film chokes the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolism. In this context, technology can be part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ ', the real world feels like a game, and as a result, human behavior changes to use violent game behavior even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machines to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's beliefs, which is a well-known media theorist that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like the phone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, telegram is an expansion of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an expansion of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biologically and thus more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, people become more mechanical and therefore less available, unable to withstand their game behavior. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of human existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a communicated society in his book Simulacra and Simulation, which all the power of action has been transformed to appear. The world has entered into a pure simulation of itself. In the eXist, it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self to others. While in eXistenZ, consciousness is slowly replacing with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection of each individual's real life subconscious. As you strengthen your hyperrealistic life step by step, the aura disappears in your real life. For Baudrillard, `simulations or simulacra have become hyperrealistic, more than real. "Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation," .now and for all purposes is more real than what we call the real world. '(Baudrillard) The purpose of the game, which can basically be called' experience ', is quite metaphorical. Because you can't even know what experience is, unless you experience it. As existentialists say that life without a precise explanation is absurd, eXistZ's play is also absurd. Cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. In the game, the other roles are eg. Just ask, unless you ask them for a pre-programmed question. And when you put their speechless fun appearance into being in our life's representation, the deferred absurdity is really shock. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anxiety about the people who play the eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the underlying cause of their existence. The essence. Existentialists have determined that humans do not have a solid nature or essence that other animals and plants do; Each person makes choices that create their own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher of the 20th century, Jean Paul Sartre is the existence of the essence. `Choice is therefore central to human existence and that is inevitable; Even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice involves commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have claimed they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment, wherever it goes. Perhaps I should mention that 'eXistenZ' also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You achieve your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you don't, then the game gets annoying and boring. So, you start interrogating the game, your existence instead of your essence. You suddenly become skzophrenic alian from the game and realize your position outside the game. As a final word, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse simulation of life, thus existentialism. <br /> <br />
