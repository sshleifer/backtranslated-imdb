I have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. At times, well, more than half the time, I can't see the movies there. I have systematically tried to see each of the movies I've missed. So far, plagues and pleasures on the Salton Sea and who killed the electric car? are the other movies I've had to see this way. The film covers an exciting subject and is well-theorized (emphasis on this later), but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far better than Electric Car. <br /> <br /> The film's thesis is the future of the American concept of suburban living. It questions the possibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. Then the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it is evolution until the early 2000s. One theme that the film discusses in the long run is the alienation that suburbs create among its inhabitants. While more people can live together, they do not know "each other" when we define the word. This to me represents the strength of the film: its appeal to the actual human feeling. We are able to understand the filmmakers' arguments so much easier because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their arguments. This is also one of the reasons why the Salton Sea is a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Suburbia loses its fire-fire statement in support of its key argument. As the interviewees speak, their arguments are gradually becoming more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will reach its peak in this decade, but does not receive scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) in support of this claim. We get some information on how this date was calculated. Fortunately, it was the only significant mistake I could see in the film's argument, but it is a brilliant one anyway. Another less important disagreement noted I was the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias has revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. The clips, especially those from the 1950s, seemed a little unnecessary to me. The movie was no better with their presence and would have been more accurate in their absence. <br /> <br /> As I was thinking more about this movie before composing this review, I thought why I found its argument more convincing than other documentaries I had recently seen. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis for the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized village system where people's pockets would live together. They believe that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. They define wasted space as the long stretches of parking space between shopping areas, for example. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is actually conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely indicate that some problem should be completed, but do not provide a method to do so. Think more about the movie, I decided that this analysis is what saved the movie to me and why I give it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Although not entirely convincing or fluid in the presentation, End of Suburbia is a valuable investment for your time. It not only deals with the modern problem of sprawl, but it also provides realistic insight into how to change it. The audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950s spliced ​​with the modern arguments. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will especially enjoy this documentary, as sprawl is the most established there.
