My family sees this movie over and over again. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like the "goodness" of the movie. Giving the stranger a chance ... shows goodwill for a natural need for unconditional acceptance. The film gives a feeling of good will and victory. Another aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is Velvet's siblings personalities. The bird loves. Bug Laws. The boy loves! Very cute and happy movie. There is one thing, but it is annoying about it. It is so that Mrs. Brown often does Mr. Brown to be foolish or unwise. She sometimes comes out as one knows it all and he is like a dim white, which he is not. Too bad to put it into such a good story. Nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie!
