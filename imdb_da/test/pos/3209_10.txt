Hands down, the best drama / comedy show on TV. A wise written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter explores life and finds out things not just about the world but also for them. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) is struggling to find a way to stay close to her daughter, but steer her on the right path, which gets harder and harder throughout the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in the world of books and learning has just begun to discover boys and their own sense of rebellion, which surprises both of them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge selection of other fun characters, this show is easily one of my favorites. What really puts the show over the top is the complex yet incredible, and twisted, writing that often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
