This is definitely a "must see" movie. The excellent director Alain Chabat (also acting as Ceasar) has managed to capture the essence of Astérix 'Adventures' (the French cartoon it builds on) and create a fantastic modern and intelligent comedy which is also a tribute to the world of Animated movies. This movie is so fun, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it can take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) may not get all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues that are impossible to translate, so many situations that are directly related to the comics or to the French lifestyle that the fog can become smaller. But it's still worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent play. All players are good, but the movie would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please compare this amazing movie to the horrible previous one based on the same cartoons: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and directed by Claude Zidi.
