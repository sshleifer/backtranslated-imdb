"Jaded" should not be considered an erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for sailing, as opposed to movies such as "complete behavior" or "family family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not easy to see, as history is hard to imagine, and it is not so common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more powerful scenes. <br /> <br /> The violent scene was not (in my opinion) a well-established scene. I think the director didn't use real camera techniques in the movie. Therefore, it sometimes looks boring and becomes boring almost at the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good from all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic abilities of the actors. <br /> <br /> The legal concepts helped much to understand the difficulties of the plot because the legal term for sodomy is different from a simple rape. From Meg's defense, the sodomy must be punished as a rape (a major crime rate B), even if it is another crime. Pat and Alex's defense claim that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. This is where the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing that is certain is that the sex scene fits a legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> See "Jaded" if you like legal issues that are not very common in your community. If not, try it because it is a very good and strong drama.
