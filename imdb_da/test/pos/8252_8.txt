I remember seeing this movie in the mid 80's thought it was a good paced and well-acting piece. I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and they had to get a copy of the DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed, even though my office is just 30 seconds away from the "bank". Even Jack Barclay's car dealership is still selling Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> The DVD seems to be due to a region 2 release soon. The region 1 copy I is very poor quality. Let's hope they've cleaned up. <br /> <br /> Only the slightly risky escape sequence from the court wastes what would otherwise be a good movie, but I think that is in line with the caper tag that the movie goes with.
