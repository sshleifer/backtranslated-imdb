action packed with my favorite type of creature. I will not give any of it away if you have not seen it because it is worth taking the time to sit and race in the mystery of things presented in this movie. It was slow at times, and it was the moments when my mind was wondering, which made it anyway, but humid of it kept me calmly excited about keeping it in the head instead of letting it out, probably the mood I was in time. Especially effects and action sequences you can feel ready for occasional lulls.For course there is a showerload of movies out there, as such, the film still has its own style and taste, which I respect from underground independent horror movies anyway.
