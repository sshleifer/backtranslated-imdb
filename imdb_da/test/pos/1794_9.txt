In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas watched his ability to perform them. He was always a good writer, but it took him time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first films to make big use of color from the bright green bulbs in the merchant's wagon to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder film? which had been thought). His camera work was there too, but it was still quite minimalist. The occasional zooms seem a little unpleasant at times and unnatural, but again Fassbinder still came out of its purely avant-garde phase. This may be due to Michael Ballhaus not behind the camera, but instead the slightly inferior Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> It's still Fassbinder and you get your solution here. Broken dreams proved so vivid and unthinkable to alienate the audience and drive them into a depressed stupidity. Just what the doctor ordered. An early classic showing remarkable progression compared to his first film released only 2 years earlier.
