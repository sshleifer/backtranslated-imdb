This is unfortunately a little known movie ..... I say "unfortunately" because it stands up to the "classics" of the American silent screen! <br /> <br /> It's about a legend about a "phantom wagon" that moves around the world and captures souls from those who are dead. Legend has it that the last person who dies on New Year's Eve is doomed to drive the car for the next year. It resembles the sequence of the "future of the future" Dickens famous "Christmas Carol". The double exposure effects of the ghosts (especially when interacting with the "living" people) are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you love quiet movies, watch this. it will "blow you away"! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Norms old movie sky http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
