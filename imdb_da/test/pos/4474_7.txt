The story begins with a soldier being transported to a desert town, and then goes back in time to tell the story of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army camp in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After almost hungry and / or dying of thirst he came across a leopard who somehow became his merciful. It brought him food and soon the soldier was almost wild, so his bond with the animal was acute. However, all things end and the man decided that he needed to leave the critic. A very strange film, well-written and portrayed. Beautiful landscape from Jordan and Utah, which did not always blend perfectly, but who cares.
