It's a spoof, it's an intelligent comedy, it has some pathetic actions and choreography (and remember it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances of the whole cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and over a script which is so rare in Indian cinema it also in comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story is of two wastes whose sole purpose is to become rich and famous in what ways. They come across such a way when they find out that a rich NRI is entering India to get married. The rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these game try to get along with each other. The entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. Songs are rightly located and are fun. Surprise package is Salman, who performs with perfect timing, and this particular act gave him his comedy. <br /> <br /> Everybody a fucking movie that you shouldn't ignore if you like and watch Indian cinema.
