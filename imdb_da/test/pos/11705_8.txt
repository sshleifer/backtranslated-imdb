This is the first feature film from Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also starring alongside several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al. The basic prerequisite for the movie is that the slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has joined a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free parking space near his work. The club is in dire financial lines and calls on Jack to help. John Clarke plays the club bow nemesis - he tries to take over the club and turn it into a "Poker Machine Slum" Jack and the other club members join together to try to save the club with many fun phrases and Jack's possible redemption. This is a pretty clever little movie. It's well over Mick Molly's usual boy humor. It's pretty well written and well-acted. The older Aussie actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson Monica Maughan and Ors). The film winds itself together rather than pausing in the neck, but it enhances the charm of the film. There is low level rough language.
