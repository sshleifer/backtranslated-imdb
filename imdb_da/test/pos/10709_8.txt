Favela Rising is a documentary about Rio's slum, favelas, especially the most violent, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children have been killed tremendously in Rio's favelas over the last decade or so than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - a fact amazing if that is true, demonstrating that this social is not recognized. problem is in the rest of the world. This is an important issue, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to march the most needy and most vulnerable through a living cultural program. This is a compelling documentary if it is occasionally destroyed by a slightly personalized version of events and by grainy digital video and movies that sometimes make you think you should have your eyes examined. <br /> <br /> Drugs rule in favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers, as in parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirelles' film City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of Rio's many favelas). But the early part of Favela Rising shows that favela boys celebrate facts and want to treat drugs where the money and the action are. It is cold to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug trafficking: it is 50 times more profitable than any other available earnings. <br /> <br /> Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to finish his work and come down to help Make a movie with its own promise to fund it. Sás eloquent and charisma and a sensational twist in his life make him the center of the film and its main narrator, but as the favors themselves hit the film with other people. No doubt Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: Shooting was very dangerous. Anderson's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in shooting allowed filmmakers to access and shoot detailed footage of their subjects, while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding serious confrontations with drug addicts or anti-narcotics. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home. This resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare shootings of violent incidents, including police assault. It is difficult for an outsider to keep track of the police massacres in Rio. There was one in the early 1990s who ventured over history and inspired Sá, who completed his own early engagement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. The police are all drug trafficking and if anyone does not like, the poorly trained police paramilitaries come in (often wearing black ski masks) and shoot up a quarter and kill many innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is basically the image we get in Meirelles' City of God, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other guys come in, starting in Vigário Geral, but eventually spreading to a row Other favelas for giving percussion classes that attract dozens of young girls as well as boys. Their AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR) program, created in 1993, is a new alternative lifestyle for young black men in Rio ghettos. It causes them to leave smoking, alcohol and drugs (it's the rule) to explode in rap, singing, percussion, and gymnastics in expressive galvanic beliefs. Ultimately, the best of the performing artists, such as Sá, are leading large local audiences with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups have been created by or through GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to seek improvement of youth by providing training and laying up of music, capoeira, theater, hip hop and dance GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> Performing art is not everything, just the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for wider social change. Gathering public awareness through such beliefs, the centers also provide education in information (newspaper, radio, internet, email links), hygiene and sex education to bridge the gap between rich and poor, black and white, and to offer workshops in audiovisual work, including production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising, and they look very much like the images of the City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are much, much more positive. Not that it's not an upward battle. And police corruption, inequalities in the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of these. But there is a scene where Sá speaks to some young children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade he himself did as a boy. It doesn't seem convincing to any of them, despite the fact that the traffickers do not do so at the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, came to the movement five months later. There is also a freak accident that is handicapped but with a positive result. It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer, and if the story was slightly edited, but it is vibrant and inspirational material and represents committed, risk-taking documentary production, and it is good that Favela Rising has been recorded in seven film festivals and won series of awards, including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently shown at the Institute of Modern Art (ICA) in London. But a broad art house audience in the US seems somewhat unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
