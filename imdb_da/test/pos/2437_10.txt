It was a sweet, intro for the most intelligent Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. He at the beginning wrote a love letter to Ami, who would be starling (of course) and now, Ami Thiks, he is a chibi-Einstien and he is attractive (he ended up looking like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (expesialy Minako is "There is no skin outside the neck" scene (HOT!)) Well, I like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, I personally think it's the best anime ever! But this movie was nice, fun, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R- It was more like the "S" movie. I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with Real Player, and it was pretty good. (Overall)
