I lay in bed, fluttering through the channels ... and boy do I have channels ... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably see a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... DVD has spolied me. At least I blink through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could it be? When I first saw the researchers at this movie in the theater, I remember making fun. I never thought I'd see it ... never anything like that. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book and you can tell. The movie is very episodic, and it's not like the movie has a big plot, it just sucks you in. Maybe it's the ideas that do it. I'm pretty sure it should have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason ... Peter's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
