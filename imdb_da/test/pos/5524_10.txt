The work title was: "Do not Spank Baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford continued to be a successful producer, films like Valley Girl, Comet Night and others, though he was not too amazing in this little gem. And little known Abe Zwick should have got lots of work from this movie, but it didn't. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood Florida, at the same party, the early Tarzan movies were filmed. This movie is destined for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes. For reasons known only to Tom Casey the director, the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of LSD, and nudity was removed. Although this version is worth looking for the so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have packed the shock that was needed to make this a full on the Slasher 70s Cult Classic.
