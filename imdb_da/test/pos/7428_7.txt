This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times I found the beginning so boringly sweet and "schmaltzy" that I just stopped seeing. But now that I'm a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie, and I was very surprised to see that I actually liked it quite a bit. So I watch the movie the same way I'd look at swimming in the sea when the water temperature is 70 degrees (it's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all the metric lovers out there). Sure the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you FORCE yourself to stay in the water, you get used to it - so resist the urge to jump out right away !! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by a lispy Patti Brady. Some may find conversations very sweet and endearing, although others may find them a little difficult to take, as those moments are so gosh-darn sweet! In a sense, it was some great actors of Flynn because it is hard to imagine that he really has children or acts domestically, especially that he wanted to be faithful to a woman in this movie - now it is !! NEVER GOODBYE concerns the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their common desire to marry. Since they both love each other as well as their lispy child, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will again tie the knot. However, there are some serious problems: Lucille Watson (who plays his usual indulgent and controlling mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is Errol Flynn, and he is divorced so you should expect him to have a girl where as preferably) and a sea (played by Forrest Tucker). Not unexpectedly, all this is done at the end and everyone lives happily ever. Despite being formal and predictable, the movie is a winner because it is so fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good at comedy romance and it's just fun to see him. Also the film has the ever-scenic chewing Cuddles Sakall - he is just so gosh-darn sweet and sweet that he is perfect in this type of movie. And despite the sweetness, the film is quite well-written. The bottom line is that the movie is FUN. So my recommendation is that you watch this movie and force you not to draw on the sickly sweet aspects of the movie. Once you have come across this, the rest of the movie is a picture worth your time.
