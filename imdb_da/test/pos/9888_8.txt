I watched this movie last night at Phila. Film festival. It was an interesting and fun movie that had some beautiful and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent as the rest of the cast. They were trustworthy and played their roles well. The movie may have been a bit long and the conclusion was okay. The audience laughed at the right places. The family dynamics were amazing, and although this was a Jewish family, they could have been Italian, Irish or any other, including Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a topic that is not often handled that way. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clear in your life.
