As a big fan of horror, I had given up on the vampire subgenre because of the fact that the vampire in most vampire flicks has become feminine and non-threatening, benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I led to a show of Soul's Midnight, and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this movie have at least hungry to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors from all the time, was born to play the charming vampire with wild intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel. It's cold because (and I went back to my high school copy to look it up) in Dracula, Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker has to pass to get to Dracula's Castle. Finally my hats off to the one who made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn CGI! That's the one thing that's good about many low-budget movies, they can't afford the computer-related waste effects that plague many Hollywood monstrosities. <br /> <br /> The bottom line ... this is better than Underworld safe, especially if you are a vampire cleanest. Cheers, YES
