Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We didn't have to prepare much for the cool part that came with us, and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first big movie role and we had a blast to do it. We were 21 at that time and lived about an hour and a half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up in front of the TV and probably some of the first generation of latch-key kids. Twenty years later we still have a lot of fun and are still "heavy" or whatever is politically correct these days. We do not pursue anything more, but have been aware of coming back when the right opportunity comes. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California and I am in the field of information technology in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I may have confusion, but I thought the movie was cute, clean, and fun. We knew it was not a masterpiece or an Oscar nominated, but it was and still a movie the whole family can see and have fun together. It's great that you don't have to worry if your toddlers see a video without having to speed up certain parts. And no one was more excited when it was released on video as Carol and I were. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! Now it is a cheap way to capture his memories and share it with others. Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson Twins
