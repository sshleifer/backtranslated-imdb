This gem captures the early 80's brilliantly. As a degree '83 boy <br /> <br /> I have to say that Valley Girl (along with the Fast Times at Ridgemont High) stands out as the class of teen sex movie <br /> <br /> genre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; <br /> <br /> vapid template chickens, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are all represented here. <br /> <br /> I've seen this over ten times now. The music in the movie was top <br /> <br /> notch. Unfortunately, these tunes could never be so popular in their era as those of the arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out records <br /> <br /> and tapes (that was the 80s!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls and Modern English. <Br /> <br /> This movie deserves respect. It's not just a good 80's teenage girl. It is <br /> <br /> a great movie. Period.
