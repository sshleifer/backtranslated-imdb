The film starts with a board meeting at a larger advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the table for no reason other than that he is black and the agency needs a "token" on the board. Swope ignores the meeting, reads the jet magazine at the big table, and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly, CEO is on site. No time is wasted. A vice tool is called to pull off the body, and the board immediately and uncertainly tackles the business of choosing a new CEO. And since the voices stem one by one, the excitement is built up and then finally struck in a hilarious ironic climax for the vote, giving the viewer a delicious right of logical consequences to enjoy the rest of the movie. If you've ever talked back to some stupid TV commercials, you like to watch this movie. Too bad there seems to be no real Putney Swopes in the world.
