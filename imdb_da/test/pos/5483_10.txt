"In Fire of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I have seen, it builds and builds on a great climax. This movie really pulls you in your heart beats and you are the breath of action. The support shifts into strong sensations, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is expertly directed by tension master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers don't get much better thn this, don't miss it.
