with two old friends. I have always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and of course, their team effort is always worth watching and often funny. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't do it personally, watching this movie as in the hilarious category, it's certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principal actors and 60s style romantic comedy plots. <br/> <br /> Brent Spiner can actually steal the show in the form of laughter as the arrogant and tyrannical cross director. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain hugely attractive.
