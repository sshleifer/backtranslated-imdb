I only went to watch this movie because I always wanted Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a good job in the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were capable of good, if not great actor moments, some of it lacked here. Some of the scenes were just not credible and did not have enough storyline. <br /> <br /> Although the film requirements affect Hurricane Katrina's immersion, there was very little (none) with that effect in the movie. On the whole, I liked the fact that the film portrayed some of what is about saving lives from a water perspective. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and more than a little scary. Not sure I will ever go deep sea fishing again ... <br /> <br /> I was expecting a little more emotion in the movie than what was presented. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a movie that could 'I've been seen on DVD.
