Okay, here's the deal with this movie. It's not the best, but for all of you 80's kids out there it will bring back good memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love rainbow bites and the nursing bear. So in my opinion, if you are not a child now or was a child who loved and / or loves rainbow troubles, you may not like this movie at all.
