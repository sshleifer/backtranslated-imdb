While I totally agree with the below below that Mary McCormack flops a milk bag on television, the rest of the show is amazing! Phil Hartman was great in a professorial way, teaching celebs ins and outs. Foley is a nut but in a good way. You never know what self-muting humor he's going to come up with next. In terms of playing, it is entertaining, full of witty banter, and great for any beginner who might even have an interest in the game. Too bad is it no longer :( I just checked the schedule all the way to August, and it seems to be scheduled at any time in the future. Bad Bravo! You deserve a blow!
