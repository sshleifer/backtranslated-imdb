I thoroughly enjoyed Gabrielle Burton's story of a mysterious gift and how it affects the recipients of the past and the present. The talented Burton family of five film-creating sisters, a writer mother and dance couple offer a charming plot, edited for clarity, memorably chosen songs, and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the character's vulnerability invited me into their predicamant. There was a father-like attitude to this work of touching undertones of innocent marvels. fanatastic
