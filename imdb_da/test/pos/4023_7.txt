Somehow, this movie has dug that way into the soft point of my heart. Don't ask me how it happened, but I suppose to have the movie feature Ed, "I want to sponsor something". McMahon as a hauling crackhustler had little to do with it. Frankly, I was disappointed with Slaughters first outing in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throw-together to follow Shaft mania. How does the successor get away from this? Big Jim Brown seems stronger than slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps it was because a year later he had something to work from, instead of his simple "Be like Shaft" motivation before. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding part of the movie is the audio track provided by the pimp dad number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is adorned with a touch of funk by the godfather. An excellent period film, for music, wardrobe, vehicles, lingo and hair. I should also point out that this movie is also an excellent period movie to represent a time in film history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually grow hair. Double chickens, double blown, triple body count and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You're going to be a hell of a 70's action girl, and one who stands out from the predecessor, no less. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation movie ever made. Even shaft. Chances are you disagree, but Slaughters Big Rip-Off has its own distinctive feeling. Something was originally lacking.
