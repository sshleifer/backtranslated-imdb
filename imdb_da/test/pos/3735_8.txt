Being a middle-aged mother herself appreciated me much to see a romance between adult people weaving in the many problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane depicts beautiful Adrienne and the victim and conflict that a mother goes through and wants to do what suits her children, but still has a good life herself. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who's kind of shaking, but learns about himself. Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with rides across Australia, with little conversation between them, it is considered a high romance. We get so much more here at Rodanthe. She redeems him. He sets her free. It is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans in a flame of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Perhaps the film was a bit too subtle at the point that it was the letters they shared during the following year that deepened their relationship - again another truly life-driven way of getting to know a person. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed the plot and the themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines rang so true, and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the relationships with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend who reminds us that there are many kinds of love, not just romantic love. This is not an easy romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace, which some might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a work of art. Look for the driftwood on the porch of the first pan-over house - very beautiful. I also enjoyed music and nature, which combined to create the effect of the location as the third protagonist. It was this place away from their regular lives that enabled them to see themselves and each other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry, come out Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
