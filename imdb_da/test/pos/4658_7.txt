Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells play a song in my head. I can't forget it, no matter how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and it comes to you! Wish I could find a copy of this on a 45rpm post. Five different teams run out one night at L.A. for a scavenger hunt for tracks instead of physical objects. An effortless game master with two beautiful assistants is the mastermind of all this insanity being released at LA All teams are stereotypes (this movie is from 1980 before political correctness turned everything up): the "good" "geeks" led by Eddie Deezen, the stupid beer-loving "jocks", "vi-don't-need-a-man-type ladies", especially red-haired. The giggling twins are also a scream. And finally, the "evil" with Stephen Furst as leader. Furst is fun as the overweight slob Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various tracks leads to a gooey mess. Movies like this are not made any more. These days, the movies must have an "edginess" to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Go back to the days when the "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. Then dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS. . .
