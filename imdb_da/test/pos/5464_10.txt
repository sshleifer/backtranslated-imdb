Captivating story of backstabbing behind the curtains. The movie follows the situation of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they fight for the unpleasant Tonight Show spot. Letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and Leno led by his agent and little devil on his shoulder, Helen Kushnick. Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienating himself from such top dogs as Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. At the end of the movie, you are so excited about how she handles any situation from guest books to delay taping, finding yourself more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his role in tee. At times, I wondered if he was any relation to the right Letterman. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or in the world of business negotiations.
