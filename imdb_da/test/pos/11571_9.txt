It is now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. In fact, I haven't seen it seriously or close to about 10 years. Now that I am an adult in my 30s, I can look back with a serious eye when I see the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In concept, the comic is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also its own original show. There are a few episodes structured like the old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster, and then he clarifies revenge on this singer's concert - just like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon. The subsequent cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, in another era. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a terrible lot of things that Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes made a lot of social comments and parody. There were celebrity impersonations. There were a lot of corny period jokes, slang and dialogue. The comedy was surreal and crazy. You can also say this exactly to Tiny Toons. Comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most definitely a throwback to the classics that had not been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades before this show. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons, and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. But the reason we don't think Looney Tunes is corny is because we didn't live back in the 40s. Also, Looney Tunes was original back these days, but today cartoons are being drawn again and again. So it is easy to perceive Tiny Toons in an unfair light because of our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general. There are certainly differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery and of course the duration of the show. They are two different styles from two different periods, done in two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes are made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons are made for children watching television. Yet they did a great job of making an original show with original gags and still paying tribute to and patterning of comedy stylings by the old Looney Tunes. When Tiny Toons had much more time to play with, they had some real moments with great animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, baby Plucky toilet episode .. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialogue exchanges is ever animated in Thirteen Something when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, each hoping to miss the other. Miscommunication is spectacular. In particular, character development in this episode and in several others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is pretty good. The female figures were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually the case for drawings of that period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture referential and self-referential humor. This was far ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened a door for writers to take comics that are so common in comics today, instead of making the boring old crap we endured as 80s children. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons ran away from it all. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a forerunner, but Tiny Toons made this surrealistic comedy cartoon a real success. <br /> <br /> As a child, I completely ignored some jokes. For example, an episode is a tribute to Marx Brothers, who I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a newborn respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I have never noticed that are truly brilliant. It's the kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I have never noticed that kind of comedy as a child. I have been thinking of this for most episodes I recently watched. <br /> <br /> You will notice these kinds of things if you have actually seen the show. Unlike some other reviewers here, who I know is unfair to judge what I've seen all the episodes and have thought of them thoroughly, exposed both as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can tell that there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice also working. I'm not just talking about the protagonists, but the side signs were made really good and creative too. But back to the protagonists, some of the protagonists were brilliant. Tress MacNeille, in my opinion, had her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some great things here. <br /> <br /> This is not all to say that the show did not have any bad episodes. It had plenty. It also had many mediocre. But by far, it certainly had many really fun episodes. Especially back when it was first aired, it was actually fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos to push the envelope and break down the doors leading to a new era of cartoon.
