This movie, much of their music, is either underestimated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is amazing and in many ways ahead of its time. The pictures are fun, disturbing and at least engaging. <br /> <br /> The music is amazing. <br /> <br /> This is not the "candy pop" sound they unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and rebellion. <br /> <br /> MAIN, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys aren't in there?
