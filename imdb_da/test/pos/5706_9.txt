When I voted for my local PBS station last night to see "The War That Made America". I expected a dull documentary, but instead I got a very good and credible resume of the most important events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution and the part the Indian wars played. Larry Nehring is George Washington and he is perfect for that. The story of the camera also works great. I look forward to next week to see the rest. It's good to see that PBS really uses the HD format to bring 1700 right into our living room. I hope Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future as he is such a talented actor.
