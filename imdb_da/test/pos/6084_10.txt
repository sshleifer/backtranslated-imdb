I will not go to a generalization and say that it is the best love story all the time that some have said. That's fine, people feel very deep about this movie, you either love what I think ... or you just hate it. I don't want to say the best of all, because it is simply too "wide" for me to make a statement on this. But I feel very passionate about the English patient, as well as millions of other people do. <br /> <br /> Prizes say it all. <br /> <br /> I don't agree with critics at many levels, but those who chose this one couldn't agree more. 9-Oscar. <br /> <br /> 41 wins. <br /> <br /> 37 other nominations make this love story at the top of the pile. <br /> <br /> From the director Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts on the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.'s Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off it!" In this case, I do not agree with Elaine's answer. But the story builds and takes the right time needed to make it matter beautifully. The kinematics, (John Seale) also won several awards, as it should. I do not really pay much attention to Juliette Binoche until now. Well, not quite true I loved her performance in "Sabrina" Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship next to Harrison Ford. But it was simply an incredibly different character to her, and as deeply talented as she was, she simply shone in her own subtle and graceful way she was just what this movie was looking for. I'm really glad it was her show and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability after seeing this! What can you say except see this image again. (*****)
