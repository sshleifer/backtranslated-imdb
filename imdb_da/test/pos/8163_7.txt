LATTER DAGES <br /> Image format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Error flares when an LA party player (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with one beautiful Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). A big hit on the festival circle and limited biographical release, this sympathetic movie - debut of screenwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) is an exercise in "opposites attracts", where Ramsey is low-lying, forever changing after being hit hard by vulnerable beauty Sandvoss, limited by the poems of his religious beliefs. Here, the true way of love is paved by hardships, not least where Sandvoss's fellow-mormons react to his newborn sexuality, resulting in his excommunication from the church and his anger for his devoted parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating cameo as a boy's furious mother). But Cox's script focuses primarily on Ramsey's path to redemption when his hedonistic lifestyle is destroyed by the influence of Sandvoss and by the responsibilities arising from his development maturity: he volunteers as an outreach, providing food to AIDS patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party player Erik Palladino (TV's "is") whose illness gives Ramsey a much needed wake-up call. <br /> <br /> Cox's script is twisted with juicy one-liners and various wisdom beads (about Mormonism: "Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I'm definitely not joining - I can't imagine heaven without both! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has the sharper and more sexual role (he is first seen doing something rude to a willing participant!), But it is Sandvoss who has become something of a gay icon with his sensitive depiction of a sweet-hearted innocent whose journey from the dark to light leads to a spectacular revelation of his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well-matched, and their inevitable sex scene (short but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence, where Ramsey describes a childhood trait that has defined his life to date. <br /> <br /> Filmed on hi-def video and transferred to 35mm to theatrical show, the movie's small budget puts limits on the magnitude and magnitude of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this lesser disadvantage. Jacqueline Bisset shines like a secular restaurateur at dinner, where Ramsey is waiting for tables, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("Third Rock from the Sun") steals everyone's thunder as Sandvoss' fellow-mormon, against his friend's relationship with Ramsey on religious basis ... but only in principle. Although there are little places in the place, the film wounds with romantic longing and deserves plaudits for its honesty and compassion. Best seen with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one by your side.
