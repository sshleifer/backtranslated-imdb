I originally watched this movie in a movie theater in Times Square at the end of the eighties. Who would have thought that this movie would spell two successors and have this cult following. Night of the Demons was like most other movies that came out at that time. A group of horned teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated rooms and are then killed by one at a time in various cruel ways. Come to think of it, the formula is still used and still seems to work as seen in Saw II, as I recently saw. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade on a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle in heart! I think it makes her a really good actress if she could make a career of playing this demon-possessed woman in all those horror flicks. Anyway, I'm just this movie again on the VHS cassette and this movie still keeps up. A bit slow in the beginning, which I remembered when I first saw it, but then it quickly picks up. One of the eighties in the horror war and worth seeing!
