This short was nominated for an Oscar that lost to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangelove's nuclear war has been so much fun! Condie takes a situation and turns it on the ear and gives it a spin for good measure. Visual gags abound in Condie's work, and I always see something I missed before every time I see this. On the world's largest animation, well worth seeing for this and many other shorts. Recommended.
