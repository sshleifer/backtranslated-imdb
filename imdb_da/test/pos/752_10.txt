It's such a fun and fun movie. Very entertaining at all angles. It has an outlandish range of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge, Sargent, the child, the creepy old lady, the slam, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a large house that has no locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment, we'll see them running around, playing games and being dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... Never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> This was before Cukkos Nest and surpassed it. At least on the fun level. It even has its sweet moments. "Love is pure. Love is grace. Love is strength. You love me, your love is pure, you will always love me." Now who could resist it? Nuts are also humans. Just a couple of loose wires. Be a little careful or you get an ax in the back! Children in games. Hehe. <br /> <br /> The phone repairman was really fun and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy bunch were really real. All the characters in this movie are incredibly well played. And I found them really fun. No, HILARIOUS! They can even give you dirty thoughts on how to take advantage of them. Or how they can benefit from you. <br /> <br /> This is actually a very smart movie. There is a brilliant twist ending. I have to say that I expected this to be a good one, but never expected it. It's terrible. "The court has made its decision. You are no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so, so perfect ... you want to throw a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so excited about watching a movie like this. I will never forget it now. It's not just a cool ... it's a cool CLASSIC. Whatever you do ... Don't look in the basement !!!
