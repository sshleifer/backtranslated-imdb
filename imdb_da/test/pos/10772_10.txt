When it comes to movies, I don't easily discriminate between crap, pure crap and masterpieces. I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. This movie ran SLOWER than the Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined, and I still managed to get riveted to my seat. For me, it was the passion Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to pull out such a stunt and manage to achieve a positive effect. Bogosian probably missed one of the toughest single-man shows in modern cinema. I didn't have any respect for Bogosian until the end of the movie. The whole monologue minutes before the relentless climax was the turning point, it was the key that struck me around. This man hit a point so low that he knew he could never get out of it. The company boys congratulated him on the performance. His blistering prose even made the most beautiful in the cavalcade, shaking his head in awe. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. Stone may have pushed an uber-liberal agenda, but it was the real film and production that got my attention. Oliver Stone is a smaller master of the moody. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and filmography I've seen in any movie. Stone makes the artistic DJ booth feel like five-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. Visually, Bogosien's only friend seems to be the black foam that absorbs its routine vitriol. He speaks and it doesn't speak back. It is a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who gave him his success. Sten and Bogosian carved out a fantastic movie of a man trapped in both a prison wall and an independent prison. This man is limited to his own will and he can never escape it. The scene that made me realize his event was when he was not willing to return to his former wife. He preferred his own prison instead of the outside world. Each story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping and artistic way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and the evolution of events should be expected of every smart viewer. I just leaned back and let my mind be understood by this movie and I loved it. It's unbearable, invisible, and it will never receive its guilty recognition. Let's hope it stays that way because the gemstone deserves to be found and then hidden again. It's a gem because I found it in discount dvd bin at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50 it was worth the half hour I spent digging trying to find it. I did, and I got more than my money's worth. This is one of the best movies ever made, and it's worth ten reasons alone. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> Here my rant ends!
