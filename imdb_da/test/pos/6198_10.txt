I'm not sure how this could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The action was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the chap that played Darwyn was an unhappy, inventive person who showed the inner turmoil he joints (truck driver's death is an example) excellent. The story was credible, and the length of the series was almost equal (ie I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Brit I tend to think of Yanks as Gung Ho. The LAPD was in their poorly recommended attempt to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively. My main idea about programs like this (and also the excellent 24) is - can it happen? Would that happen? Has this happened? Optionally. I hope they do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it does not seem. <br /> <br /> To sum up - If you haven't seen it, be sure.
