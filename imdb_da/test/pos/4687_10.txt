I watched this series at PBS back in the eighties and still see the old tapes every few years or so. Very atmospheric and spooky sometimes. This is a very good show as the characters are all well-defined and acted. You are drawn into the plot and will look after these people. The bad guys are almost ridiculously evil, especially the Nottingham sheriff. Man, I would love to knock out the snotty little bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and must have had a good time being the sheriff. His whipped boy, Mr Guy, is just as hilarious, but is also pathetic. Lots of murder and chaos in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of this kind. I noticed that it was a price for children's television, which is surprising. If I had children, I wouldn't let them see this. Excellent use of places in this show too. It's now on DVD, so go and buy it.
