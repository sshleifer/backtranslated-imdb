The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. All the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, action, control, pacing, etc.). The story is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> As well as death, our protagonist finds himself living in a world without beauty, passion, or something that is extremely pleasing to the human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationship is numb and uninspiring, and when it all gets too much, he tries to finish it in front of a train. But it doesn't end - he can't leave this strange world with suicide! He goes back to a man who seemed to feel the same isolation and solitude, our main character joining him in the excavation of a stone wall in the hope of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music. Just as they break through - and I won't reveal it so much, it all comes to an end, and the movie ends as weird as it began. <br /> <br /> Saying that you either love this movie or hate it. I feel it is like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all those valid as the next. If you enjoy new movie experiences and want to be taken away from Hollywood's crap party, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I'm not easily considering!) Because despite its darkness, this movie left me with a sense of something bigger ... somewhat mysterious and beyond ourselves. Well done!
