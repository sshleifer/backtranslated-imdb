This movie is really a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and several CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Lots of non-stop action! <br /> <br /> And with the classic 80's "bad guy vs good guy" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and everything about weapons and cribs! We see Bronson beat down gays and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean war heavy machine gun! A MADE MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for the Heavy Machine gun, he runs back to his crib and picks up his weapon with his long caliber gun! This gun can stop a freakin ELEPHANT, and Charlie puts holes in the size of hub caps to bad with it! And if that's not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank grenade launcher, which by the way is only good if he can get the CREEPS lumped together. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is "ha ha" big and a lot of off the wall actors (primarily playing CREEPS) appear throughout the movie! The movie is filled with memorable a liners and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / line is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in prison and quietly explains to him: "Tell me what to do ... I'll kill a little old lady ... just for you! ... catch it at six o'clock news ". <br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Heck yes! But you will laugh and crawl all the way through !!!!
