"Capt. Corelli's Mandolin" is an old-fashioned Hollywood war romance, but with sex and nudity, and apparently no Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during World War II. The Italians arrive to take over the island, but with German supervision. There is a romantic triangle consisting of a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Beautiful performances by all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
