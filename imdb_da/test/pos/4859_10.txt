This movie packs a blow. There are a few now and then that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot. I could see myself in the same situation - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing up for the right and decent things, just trying to avoid problems. How often do we avoid making waves or sticking out our necks? How often our inaction condemns the evil actions of others. We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they do is bad, but do we do something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a key, nerdy clerk who has paid his home in Brooklyn, NY for the declining days of World War II. He rarely goes into what is going on around him, has never married, rarely socializes, just goes to work and cares about his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his very "white" neighborhood draws him out of his complacency into a mill of events. It begins as he witnessed his bedroom window rape of a Portuguese girl by his neighbor's son. Shortly afterwards he gets glasses because of poor vision. As he can now see better, he is less able to handle the conditions in his life. One bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries and hopes to continue in his normality. Then the virulent anti-Semitism takes over on that street, despite his credentials as a presbyterian WASP. As things spiral further out of control, he discovers that he has to make an important decision - he takes a position or simply goes away. <br /> <br /> I don't know how anyone can watch this movie without being touched and have to think a lot about themselves and what they really stand for. The anti-Semitism of postwar is the setting here, but there is injustice all the time and in all places. It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands.
