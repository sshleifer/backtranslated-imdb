This is a charming little movie, which, like many of it, fetches its charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford (as always) shines through in a great comedic performance as a penniless air force officer, married after just one day to gold-engaging showgirl Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> After the first wedding anniversary of passion and a change of life to Spain, the two soon realize that apart from strong sexual attraction, they feel each other, they have nothing in common. <br /> <br /> But when she decides to give their marriage a go, it is assuming that only in a one-month trial period and sex is definitely not on the cards. Ford is also falling to his new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car (the future Batmobile), which he wins at a standstill that night, he meets his new wife. </ br /> <br /> The car brings him unwanted attention from the Air Force, which sees it as a vulgar di splay of American wealth and raises suspicions of corruption and disruption. It's also putting him in the 80-90% tax bracket, and as easy as he is, he now faces a tax bill of over $ 17,000. Not the kind of money you should be due to when your wife is the kind of person who spends over $ 1,000 on a shopping trip. Even when he tries to sell it, it brings him the misfortune of selling as much as a cigarette or a pair of socks until the natives can be punished by court, so you can imagine that a $ 17,500 transaction has virtually the firing range Polishing their rifles. His potential buyer is also causing him problems as he is a scary beautiful Bull-fighting Spanish nobleman whose interest in the car has led to a stronger interest in Ford's wife, worse off the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is offered and is what she has been looking for long. <br /> <br /> With Ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love-competing mount, coupled with Reynold's materialistic attitude and flirtatious behavior about the enamored Spaniard serving to drive the wedge deeper between the two, it seems that their Whirlwind conditions are destined to end. <br /> <br /> But what can love and attraction that threw these two love birds together at first shine through and hold them together? <br /> <br /> Not the best example of this genre of movies, but because of the clear performance of its principles and the comfortable plot line, it is definitely a good one.
