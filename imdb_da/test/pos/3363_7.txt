Overall, the father's army film is very fun, although humor is not quite as spectacular and glittering as in the television and radio series. So where do we leave, viewers? If you've never seen Dad's army, then the movie is a great way to get started and get hold of the crazy world of Walmington o / S. The downside is that you might not "get it" because I like That said, humor in the movie is a bit on the stool side. <br /> <br /> For father's army, the buffers movie is nothing new as the story is more or less a cut-up of the TV series, but it's a unique opportunity to watch your favorites in "high def" for the shitty quality of BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> The film also includes what should be the lame holdup sequence in the history of the universe. I can't imagine it being positive or negative.
