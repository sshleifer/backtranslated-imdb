I am an abuser of the TV show, live shows and everything they do. And that was the last piece of work they've done on television / movies like "The Gentlemen League". <br /> <br /> If you love the series, then you will absolutely love the movie. It's a nice ending to their TV series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and fun. While not focusing on some of the most popular characters, it is still good to see all the characters together and with the authors. One must look for any League of Gentlemen fan. <br /> <br /> See it!
