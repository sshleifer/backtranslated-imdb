I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. When people ask who you, if you could have 6 extraordinary 2000's over for dinner, well, for me a person would be her. I think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofessional personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make a big telephony (hello, Mr Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films from the 40s and 50s. I remember being sad to see her reduced to a terrible part in a horrible AIP movie that is late 70s. She was bitten by a large worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her so when she died not long after ... more from the part than the worm too. In High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller at Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the producer and leading actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, she produced many now-timeless noir dramas that are still very exciting today. One of them is JENNIFER, which I think is the last movie with a Monogram Pictures copyright. Monograms formally changed the company name to Allied Artists in 1953, and JENNIFER has both company names on the opening credits. This is an overall haunted house thriller as scary as both The Innocents and The Haunting made 8 years later. Really chilling and very scary, this little movie is just the kind of really good movie Ida Lupino made and was responsible for. Try and find it ... you'll always remember it, and as I feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
