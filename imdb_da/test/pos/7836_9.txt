Forget some white (and meaningless) comments left here by some. This series is well-acted, well-shot, and makes a refreshing change to most of the cardboard on TV. <br /> <br /> Any fool can nitpick anything. But in this show, the characters are credible, the story is exciting and compelling (but requires some intelligence from the viewer). Overall, it's fun and it's British !! (We occasionally come up with some gems, and this is one of them). The views are an hour long and I think there are four of them all (at least I have only seen four of them). The show impressed clearly on an American television station / director who made a longer series that was not as close as convincing despite the larger budget. <br /> <br /> If you like soap and reality, you won't like or understand eleventh hour.
