If as fun as the 50s British comedy can get, ST TRONIAN'S BELLER has almost a gag a minute ... and at 91 minutes makes a great time. Other films that I even recommend in the same period are TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, any movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a pleasure. In ST TRINIAN'S, we get a double dose of Sims playing two roles with the hideous contempt he constantly ripples over his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (Oh dear! That name!) Plays his "jolly hockey picks" constable incognito for hilarious perfection. Possibly the best laugh from George Cole as Flash Harry (coming out of a bush when he whistles) and various visits to the classrooms of Fritton (Sims) that react to explosions ("Oh poor Betty!") Or science lab gin production "just send a few bottles of it to my room"). Every part of the movie is fun from the characters, their costumes antics and the setting. There were successors, but the first three are the best: including this, BLUE MURDER AT ST TRINIAN'S and later in color THE GREAT ST TRINIAN'S TRAIN ROBBERY.
