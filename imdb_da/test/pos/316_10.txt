During the final drawing of the Vitnam war, Capt is dispatched. Willard (Martin Sheen) centrally located in Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) of an illegal one-man mission to murder a dismissed US naval commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'crazy' but who is successful in performing a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia a neutral and therefore without limits. <br /> <br /> The all-famous story of what Willard sees and does when he is on the way up the Da Nang River of an unspoilt and terrorized naval patrol boat member to murder Kurtz is a great metaphor for flooding decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: if we do not understand something and we cannot control it, eradicate it. Kurtz had finally come to know this. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay full attention to any emotional gesture, to every word in the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two are alone in Kurtz's darkened Lair, you will miss one of the key themes in this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his one-sided "surrender" in return for Willard agreed (he nodded?) To tell Kurtz 'son (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the movie) the truth about all those The horrors that they both saw in Vietnam are mind-expanding stuff.The bond between the two men, while Kurtz crosses Willard-interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, no, genius, movie. The final (intercut) scene of the ritual slaughter of an offering is the most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has deliberately or not made the ultimate anti-war declaration, one that must resonate through the ages.
