I didn't expect much from this movie, and I was hit in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the protagonists of this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out like who you really are, which is really what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express her ideas with words. He breaks slowly but surely out of his shell and becomes much less awkward. Each viewer feels the movie's ups and downs, and the theater is full of laughter 75% of the time. The movie satisfies everyone, and I hope it will soon be released in all American theaters, because many don't have the chance to watch the movie unless they live in big cities. It is a must see!
