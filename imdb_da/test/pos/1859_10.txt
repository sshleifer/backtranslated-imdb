I've read reviews of this movie that found it 'disappointing' and 'confused'. I'm at a loss to understand why it should be like that. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to see. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The opening titles overlay a beautiful view of the evolutionary process and it introduces the story to a calm and sweeping style. The film is not about the process itself, although it relates to Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his late daughter, and his quest for truth. The appearance of his daughter is the manifestations of a troubled mind that knows that it has "killed God". The daughter is an adult, makes adult comments about her work and tortures Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in any way responsible for her death? Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly provide truly amazing performances like Charles and Emma Darwin, like Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and awkward gait give Darwin's character a true sense of reality, while Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and sometimes some serious persona. It is easy to misunderstand the times when this movie is located. Seized as the religion had on society and the inner struggles, as a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth of what he experienced. Science and religion have always been unpleasant bedfellows, and although it did not cost him his life as it did with so many former men and women, science put a barrier between man and wife, facts and beliefs. This film portrays the barrier very well. <br /> <br /> I give Creation ten stars because I think it's beautiful, deep, amazingly well-done and a real, non-frank frills-demanding look at one of the world's true geniuses. What seems obvious to everyone today (yes, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "religious") was hidden for millennia. The truth, when discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines the pain and the realization that we are all we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie experience.
