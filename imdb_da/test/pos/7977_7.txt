I really enjoyed seeing hell pay. I've been a fan of Westerns as long as I can remember, and one reminded me of a lot of the Western 1960s (though I was too young to have seen them in their first race). The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was diverted occasionally. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many other fans of Gunsmoke noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor. It was a game of Doc Adams' name from Gunsmoke. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if it was his choice or Chris McIntyre's? Anyway, I would recommend this movie to fans of Western. Don't expect anything too "deep". Just plain old entertainment.
