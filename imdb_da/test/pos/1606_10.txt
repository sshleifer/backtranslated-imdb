It can be difficult to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Maybe because I had never imagined that a plot like this or a movie with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is being exploited as a perfect landscape: dark, descending and dull like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more like a simple background that accompanies human emotions. In my opinion, is a classic masterpiece of European film making.
