This is a FANTASTIC film. Hána is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his whole life every day by gathering with his friend who is fighting for almost everything, even his own death. Although his wife cannot handle her "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that it is precisely because she loves her husband for almost fifty centuries. I would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy life and never fear of death. He is happy, witty, vicious and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský played brilliantly Hána at the age of 79. Every glance from the eyes and every movement from his aging muscles delivers so much about the character to the audience. This is a movie that leaves a big smile on my face and it makes me look at my own life a little closer. Tomorrow I'll buy myself a mansion and have fun. If Hána can, I can too. But I think I will skip the smoking section.
