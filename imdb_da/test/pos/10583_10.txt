I just bought this movie last night and I love it. Everyone played a big part in it, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was amazing, and as Dunn said in the extras on the DVD, they made it seem like he was reliving it all over again. This movie has made my number one place in my favorite movies! I can't stop repeating scenes again and again just to see it again. I've never done it with any other movie. I would definitely recommend this to other people watching because it's such a great movie and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you !! The small montages that they show between each scene are just amazing. I think these should be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, with mostly music from the band 'HIM', which of course is my favorite band.
