The fall series is great and the director PS can't get enough credit to make these movies. I'm a bit surprised to see that not many people have seen this or the other two, but their worth cutting off if you want the picture of punk in the transformative years between the late 70's and the beginning of 80s. The movie starts with a blistering collection of clips that are played over music from the band X. Many interviews with bands and punk are giving an enlightening perspective on what survivors were like on the low rung of the ordinary ladder. No internet, crappy jobs and all out hostility collide in this genre. For new kids who haven't heard of these bands or just started one, this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. All band performances (and there are many) are awesome, especially FEAR, which never ceases to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules that offer those who care for a rare insight into the lives of these crazy people. It is true punk, as in the interview with Darby Crash's boyfriend, when they remember a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died outside their house, and it took a week or so for them to figure out what they are taking pictures off the guy and everyone including EMT has had a chuckle on this one, and in true form the interviewer asks the boyfriend if she was sorry that this guy was dead while painting their house, the answer "no i hate painters". What about black flag renting their apartment / rehearsal room for $ 16 a month! My jaw nearly fell at the moment when I rented a ten out of ten lockers to train for 400. Between seeing this and Deadwood I feel I was born in the wrong time, just missing the cowboy days and nights of it old road. The people and bands associated with the film paved the way for what harder music is today and they did it in their own unique way. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see also part 2, it's just as amazing, part 3 though I don't know what to say about.
