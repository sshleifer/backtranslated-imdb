I highly recommend this movie. It blurs the line between childhood imagination and daily reality in such a seamless way that it must be seen as being believed. The actors and director have such a perfect timing that a name that calls battle in a scene becomes a kind of dance. I loved the story line, the actors, everything. While I think there were one or two particular cheesy scenes, the whole movie was impeccably done.
