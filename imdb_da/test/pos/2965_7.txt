To sum up this story in a few sentences: A teenage girl (Amy) uses her warm body and "supposed" virginity to entice a young troubled guy (Matt) with a potential football scholarship to give her a "Full Ride" out of the city . Come to find out she's got the right reputation and has slept with many football players in the past and hoped they would offer her the same deal. Both of these children have come from restless and dysfunctional homes. Matt's mothers an alcoholic who repeatedly embarrassed him in front of his friends & Amy's mother had a bad reputation herself and became pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to put her life to her. Very predictable ending. Actor playing "Amy" is actually 33 years old and is trying to play a teenager!
