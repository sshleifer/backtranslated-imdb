I watched this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste reinforces the "Austrians = grim" thesis I am drafting. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Best Actress award in Cannes for her depiction of a woman who, in her efforts to achieve the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. In prison of her talent, she represses her feelings and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and frightening ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our aspirations rise, but soon the thought of being unaware that she cannot experience love as others can. It's too late for her, and the movie's last 30 harrowing minutes are confidential without the beautiful music that wore the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and discretion it describes.
