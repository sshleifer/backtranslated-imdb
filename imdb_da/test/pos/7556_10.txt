Film follows four friends from the 1950s (when in high school) until 1981. They are a Yugoslav immigrant Danilo (Craig Wasson) Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston) who has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) a great, strong, beautiful, robust guy. All three are in love with Georgia, but she only loves Danilo. The film focuses mostly on the two - it chronicles their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. It also enters Danilo and tries to win the father of his hard immigrant. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it's not without its bad points. Thelan's loud, shaking voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps around very quickly; Tom and David's life is never explained (Tom shows up with a Vietnamese wife and children and David has a wife we ​​never meet at the end); Some important scenes are poorly written, and there are some obvious prior releases (probably to keep the movie in 2 hours). But everything else is so good you can easily forget about the problems. The story is convincing - you really understand and understand the characters and always get caught in life. With a few exceptions, the script (by Steve Tesich) is good - in fact, Tesich was a Yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the manuscript on his own experience. All the play is amazing - especially Thelan and Wasson - also Reed Birney throws in a strong, sympathetic performance like Louie, Danilo's college roommate. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look quickly at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> It is truly a great story about immigrants, age, love for America and the 50-80s perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film was (unfairly) maligned by its release. The study did not know how to advertise it (it is a hard film to be marketed), and the critics stomped on it (Pauline Kaels' review in "The New Yorker" was particularly tough). It hardly played in theaters (I was fortunate enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theater performance) and has simply disappeared. It's a shame. This is a movie that is just ripe for re-publishing. I'm not betting on it - but you never know! One particular 10 all the way!
