The Youth In Us is a bold gem. I saw this amazing card at this year's 2005 Sundance Festival. History took me to a profound transformation. The director of Joshua Leonard, Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score - each element was true to the leg. One can only hope that this exquisite and outrageous movie is progressing to more good work from this gifted instructor. As a short film shown before a function at Sundance, commercial cinemas used a similar format in times past. It would be great if miniature masterpieces such as The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience in this way.
