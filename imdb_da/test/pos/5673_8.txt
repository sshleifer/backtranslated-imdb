The movie starts with three people at a game it at ear-holiday, who decides to first visit a crocodile farm and then move on to a slightly lighter activity, a "fishing trip". <br /> <br /> You get some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to boost the excitement later during the movie as you remember what was told earlier. The action in the movie is well timed and not over done. Suspense is built through "what ifs", the "unknown" and sometimes the gut decisions made by the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself wondering what I would do if I were in the same boat, no saying calculated. <br /> <br /> The movie quality was really good and the effects were realistic, credible and not over the top or the comic strip out and out, the way you sometimes get with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie buff, I see almost all horror movies, I can get my hands on in almost any genre, and this is one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best I have seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
