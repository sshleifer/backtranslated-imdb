Then the movie last night without knowing anything about it (nothing else seemed interesting, and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie - UB degree). It was a very enjoyable movie. Wanted the pace (it gets after a slow start) and history. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Recommended to anyone who likes watching movies that have interesting stories. Found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers - most discussions last no more than a few minutes.
