To answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the US official mentioned in "Lumumba", the name of the sign is "Mr. Carlucci." Frank Carlucci has been reported as the second secretary of the US Embassy in Congo. Subsequently, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Minister, and is now chairman of the Carlyle Group. It is hardly surprising that Carluci's biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com is unable to credit his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from the HBO version of "Lumumba", it could have been to avoid the possibility of HBOs being sued in US courts. However, Carlucci's name is clearly mentioned in the theater version of "Lumumba", which I saw recently. In that case, I expect he would refuse any involvement in Lumumba's murder. Others have commented on the straightforward act that the film "Lumumba" treats the interested parties: Lumumba supporters, other Congolese, even the Belgians. A slightly more sinister view is shown in the BBC documentary "Who killed Lumumba?", Based on the book "The Murder of Lumumba" by Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. When examined closely, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and Congo's history is not just a matter of black and white. Only Lumumba's murderers mean it.
