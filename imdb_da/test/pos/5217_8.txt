He is very good at this role as an unsettled and boring man, a decorated air force officer who is upset by his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One evening he meets Karen Sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have an affair, he is due his death to escape his family responsibilities. Lies is becoming a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy and to project the picture that he is a success. A fictitious error, apparently. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story that makes it even more exciting. Cole is trustworthy and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8.10.
