The second film about the Gaulois couple's adventure Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. The humor is great (and irreverant) and the manuscript is well done from the original 1965 cartoon by Goscinny & Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first movie (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and was reluctant to see this sequel, but I'm glad this movie was wrong. Excellent comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
