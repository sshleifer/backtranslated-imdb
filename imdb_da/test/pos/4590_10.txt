We just watched this movie in Austin Texas at Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. It made me laugh loudly many times! The scene of Albert Einstein's thoughts on humanity struck me over and over again, and I couldn't stop laughing. It's too bad, it's not in several theaters, I know many friends who die to watch this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... good work for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, be sure to get to the end of the credits too! I will take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD then you should watch this movie. It's a classic, and no one knows it's out! So, if you are in the mood to see something fun at the weekend, you should definitely check it out.
