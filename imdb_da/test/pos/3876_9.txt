The A-team still repeats every day on Dutch television (RTL7, about 1800hrs), and I still see it! I don't like A-Team ... I absolutely love them !! It's just great to see Justin chasing the former A-Team members. Bringing memories back from the old days when I was young a sweet. I would have given you a 10 to excellent, but Justin looks like he's chasing former A-Team members all alone. That is, of course, the only bad thing in this documentary. Sin Justin doesn't look for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's great to see Mr. T. back to action. Too bad for him, he does not discover at the party at the end. But the party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
