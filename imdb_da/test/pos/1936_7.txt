This pre-production code and Hays Office days are good fun, not great but entertaining. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart, a huge hit at the time, the story was about the dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck, romanticized by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently beautiful ), but whose heart belongs to her book neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley got married but keep it secret while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds hope. She helps her hubby with a job at Cortez's company, but married blissfully gets sick when Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college girlfriend and gambler in high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know that's right fun .. ..). Finally, he dimmed $ 5,000 from Cortez and is about to go on his pocket when his devoted wife goes to Cortez .... and I won't reveal anything else, even though the end was definitely a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; In one of her earliest roles, she's done right. Owsley is the weak point; he is incoherent and snorty, while Cortez is incredibly suave and sexy, while his performance is serious but unremarkable. Although it seems like a drama, it is filled with laughs, many unintentional, as some elements of this movie have been very old bad. But there are many good witty lines; at some point Stanwyck says to Cortez: "My brains are in my feet while yours is in ...." That's pretty darn suggesting 1931! There are many bawdy and suggestive things in this flick, in the last few days before the codec stretched and whitewashed everything. An entertaining antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years .... This story could very easily be changed to fit in 2003, but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place.
