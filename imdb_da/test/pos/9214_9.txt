I must admit that I am a fan of cheesy '80s cartoons, but this is among the best. Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are one of the most attentive and entertaining of Rainbow Brite comics, and are much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and find it very fun. However, my favorite character is Starlite, who is the absolute "magnificent horse in the universe"! I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland came to be. Have a rainbow day!
