This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you do not know anything about how anime studios were run. Besides episode 3, this was probably the smallest risqu√©, but it had a lovely girl interest, as well as a surprise association from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed a little too short, but it could only have been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well and left us the lovely feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25 years old and is studying further. Certainly, the rest of the series looks all the way through, you can buy the whole series for as $ 17, you can see it all the way in about 2 1/2 hours or watch your favorite department if you have 20 minutes of free time (which I do if I have a lunch break in school.) good series, check it out.
