I've always loved old movies, but it's one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, 1940's painting and good old-fashioned romance, and it's fun to start! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking home life articles to a famous magazine ... provided she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this error. Enter a beautiful GI (the game of the talented Dennis Morgan) just rescued by a fleet with his friend. His simple desire is to stay at the cozy inn, she writes so tasty about and relaxes with her famous homemade dishes. She now has to find a way to save her job and reputation. In addition, her fianc√© is busy tying the knot not helping. The humor is amazing, and the chain between the leading characters is very fun. Throw in the character actor with the name "Cuddles" (which fits perfectly to this name) becomes even more sweet. This has become my must-see movie, which I smuggle in with a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A wonderful, fun movie to enjoy in Christian time or anytime!
