I absolutely loved the movie. I've just seen it and can't wait to get out on DVD. It is a beautiful, well-designed masterpiece. I am always amazed at the intricate drawings of the Ghibli studio. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on Sosuke calling Risa at her first name. He never calls his father by his first name unless he speaks of him to another. I didn't get the impression that Risa was his mother. It was never mentioned or implied by anyone. It is quite clear that she is his mother-in-law. That's why he makes his promise to come home and why he gets so sad when he finds his empty car. His mother must be dead when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by Risa. This, together with his father, is very much out on the sea, so he has a task case. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
