A movie that deserved theatrical releases. This movie for television is a cinematic gem that exemplifies Michael Mannes technique of stirring modern music closely integrated with the visual images. Nevertheless, with Mr Mann, reinforcing the music's impact is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast, writer, director and film photographer. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my favorites all the time. Although nothing is perfect, this movie comes very close. Along with an excellent script, great direction and masterful plays by Richard Strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of character actors on their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You cannot recognize the names, but you will recognize all faces. <br /> <br /> If this comes on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn up the sound for a great soundtrack and score, and prepare to be ridden for the 97 minutes of the movie. I strongly recommend recording it as it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland, and the DVD is coded region 2.
