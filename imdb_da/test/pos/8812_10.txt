I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it. It almost felt like watching me and my friends on the screen. The way this film was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I related to these signs and even had the same thoughts as some. I'm really glad I ran over this movie. If there was only more genius' like Justin out there!
