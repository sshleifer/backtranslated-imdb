I know this movie is not for everyone, and I don't want to push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie ... It was the best I have ever seen! !! It was soooooooooooooo fun, and even though it wasn't the craziest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat because I didn't know what to do next time. If you like funny scary movies, you have to watch this one!
