One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with "Only for big fans of the main actors or fans of exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies ..." as if they were not reason enough to love it! Anyone who, after watching this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of political motivation or other extra-film concerns, simply doesn't love movies. Watch it and be confused by the star's power between the two leaders, the exotic, romantic, photography and music and the bold adventure of a real escapist movie. This is proof that Hollywood can "make them as they used to" when it really wants to. A fixed 8/10.
