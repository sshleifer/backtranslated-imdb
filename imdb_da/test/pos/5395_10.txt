This movie was amazing! I love the way it mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think there is no way you can laugh at the presented situation, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. It is wonderfully acted upon by amazing performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with a stylish and surprising ending. I am not one to say that everyone will like it as much as I did, but give it a try and rent it. The DVD has great special features, including full length commentary by director, Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch, and one by Sigourney Weaver that gives you interesting information about the movie. I hope my comment is useful and that you enjoy the movie!
