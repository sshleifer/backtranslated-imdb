Jack Frost 2 is probably the most cheesiest movie I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the movie is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of Mutant Killer Snowman. Horror movie fans who have a taste for campy story lines will be happy to see this. This movie was just for video and for good reason. Here's why: The action was so horrible and so horrible that it could make one cry. The protagonist had no personality, and the actor's bad play made it worse. The play was, too, was horrible. Each character always says a cheesy line and adds the cheesy lines to the bad choreography, so you have something bad. Second, the story is not so impressive, but since this movie was just for video, it is forgiven. The director and author could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something cool, but they didn't. Their story has lots of plot holes in it. In the beginning, a cup of coffee is wrapped in the aquarium, with the melted Jack Frost. Scientists are trying to restore their lives, but they couldn't. When the coffee cup fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to antifreeze. In Jack Frost Part 1, the protagonist's DNA was mixed with the anti-freeze that was used to kill Jack Frost. Since the protagonist is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also. So here's my point. They say Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. But one of the researchers had some saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the researchers DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects were not very good either. Here are the good points: Jack Frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic. Although this movie is flawless for hell, it is still entertaining. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. The first one was better though. 7 out of 10
