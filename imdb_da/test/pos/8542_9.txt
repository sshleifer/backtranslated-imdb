It's been almost 25 years since I saw this movie. I would consider this movie as an all-time classic in a drama category. Anthony Queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever. In a few minutes, he'll take you from grin to tears. This film represents an excellent picture of how humanity changed after World War II. How much of that generation and the future lost its innocence. It has taken me a long time to find this movie called "the 25th hour". This type of movie is not a moneymakers, but they are certainly a treasure for some. I am very surprised why this movie is not used to the media in an extended way so more people can enjoy this image.
