Why this movie was only released in 4 states is beyond me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: See other people. This movie has more logic than laughs, which I suppose is why it works so well. Common sense also seems to be another pueril sex comedy. Alice gets her feet frozen in the cold when she feels irrational about how she can perform for her fianc√©, not only sexually but as a partner and friend, etc. This begins what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for both of them. them. A fling after the other leads to problems as if it wasn't a bad idea from the start. Witty dialogue and comic books make this fun as hell! Nicholson and Mohr set the film's tone early and keep the promise they expect. Other highlights include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in his first theater film in 10 years!). Climax starts to take a crazy trip, but a simple ending makes this much more comfortable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in his Ed character, and fans of Helen Slater enjoy her shiny moments with a quick but excellent return. Every Richter takes home the prize for most moralistic character. Romantic and fun, or just fun. Seeing other people is a gem to be noted.
