Edward Dmytryk instructed this shady film about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young tells us about hatred, Robert Mitchum goes through most of this image, and Gloria Grahame regains the flaw she exhibited in "It's A Wonderful Life." It is Robert Ryan who is at the heart of the matter: anti-Semiticism. He goes so deep into his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine the parents, Lawrence, who calls their son Larry!) That the drama is right on the shoulders and he is more than up to the challenge. Without him, the film would be plain. Ryan has played a series of memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock;" "Billy Budd"), but this achievement put him on the map. With Sam Levene as murder victims.
