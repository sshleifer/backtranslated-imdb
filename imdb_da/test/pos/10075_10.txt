Watching this little movie is a pure joy from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the excitement never disappears. The whole cast is wonderful. The attitude of Walken and Bracco seems to be perfect, it's almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. Bracco is very sexy and really fun as a scam artist who fights for her independence. For some reason they gave Walken a very strange makeup and the weirdest haircut I can imagine? It's kind of a parody of the one Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. For me, it added to the pleasure. It's the first movie I saw Miguel Ferrer in, probably one of the most under-appreciated film actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even the Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. I highly recommend this movie.
