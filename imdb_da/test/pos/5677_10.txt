BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian movies I've seen for many years. My boyfriend and I sat and grabbed each other's hands and jumped in all the right spots. This is just as much a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark film. In other words, creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through the circumstances. How director Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich twist so much excitement and terror from such a modest situation is great to see unfold. And when I say terror, it is not overblown, artificially engineered crooked moments, but a little touches that when you ask yourself "how would I feel in that situation" lead you to conclude "scared harmless". Performances were great, pacing and beautiful cutaways for the second life of the mangroves were excellent, and the film's final moment felt very right. This is an appropriate debut for two directors, who should rightly be very proud. Go see this very beautiful shot and acted exciting movies.
