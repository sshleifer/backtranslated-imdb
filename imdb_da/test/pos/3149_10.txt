The reader is an exceptionally well done and very cute card. Each element of the piece helps to elicit a purely emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no exercise before admission, not even a review. The performances stand as a testament to some fine instinctual actions in response to a well-written script. The actors' work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low budget contracts enjoy actors as well as filmmakers.
