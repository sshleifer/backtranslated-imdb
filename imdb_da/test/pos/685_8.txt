I swear if I ever tried cocaine, I would be able to relate to this movie perfectly. The speed and dialogue turn out at speeds that some viewers may have to stop and relax on their heads. <br /> <br /> There are great little items that pop up through the movie like how Rob Lowe's characters always seem to lose a shoe or how some characters continue to run spirals around their zigzagged path. The story was composed extremely well and the direction seems flawless. <br /> <br /> The movie series of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most people could enjoy. A few laugh-out-loud-self-if-you-alone moments ensure that I will definitely see this again.
