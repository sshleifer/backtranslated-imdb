Scary in places, though the effects left something to be desired, unless you have poor eyesight or are afraid of the dark. But most of the action was convincing and most of the effects were well done. I thought the creature was a little too much like a man in a gorilla dress to my liking. It reminded me of the original pink panther movie.
