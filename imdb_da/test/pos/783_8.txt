A British twist on Harold and Maude, Driving Lessons has a purified Rupert Grint and an over-top Julie Walters. It's true that Grint is stent like a red-haired Benjamin Braddock in the first half of the movie. It does not detract from the crooked family movie - there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, although Laura Linysy's hard work to make her written stereotypical human is also remarkable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon.
