This is a very dark movie, something better than the average asylum movie. It was much better than I thought it would be, a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice of the phone is really scary - this voice without face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the movie, as we never see the killer face the spectators imagination. <br /> <br /> The action and excitement never fall due and after the first half of the movie it becomes vertiginous; There is not much going on in this movie, just enough to serve the story, and also the director does a good job of keeping your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8/10 because some clich√©s.
