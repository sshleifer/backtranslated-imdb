One of the best "guy" movies I've ever seen must be the wind and the lion. Gad, the scenes ... Raisoulis bandits swarm over the wall ... A stiff British gentleman stands up from tea with Candice Bergen and kills three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of the empire ... Let's forget! Let's forget! <br /> <br /> U.S. Marines come ashore from the long, long way _Brooklyn_. They were with Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow. And Winchester 97 blows big gaps in unconcerned natives and even more obscure and defiant Europeans ... Raisouli - Sean Connery, o, Wow! - Wondering "What kind of gun does Roosevelt use?" <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, o, Wow! - wondering "What kind of gun does Raisouli use?" and writes another angry letter to Winchester about the store at his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with a sword ... A Prussian cavalry, HOLSTERING his gun and drawing his sword ... Honor. It's something far from dead, from a world that has gone a long way, but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children in a building ... Milious at Milious's grand best and now out on DVD.
