For my money, probably the best movie - or at least the most purely movie movie director Ford ever made. The dialog is quick, cut to the point. The story starts at the beginning and ends only with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small casting, but manages them and shoots them with a crap and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, very entertaining, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after that), with the best photography and editing in any American black and white movie. Is much for Sergei Eisenstein's editing method, but never as coolly detached or "scientifically" as Eisenstein often could get. And a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history. A little blur: it is not clear why the film involves the Mormons, who, as far as I know, were never the pacifists Quakers and Amish were. This confusion leaves a little bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the movie is such a feast, it's easy to ignore. In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and seen again (and again and again).
