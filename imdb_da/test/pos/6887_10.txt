This program is a favorite of our family and we feel it MUST be released on DVD after the seasons !!! The title of "Promised Land" is very suitable as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in it! It is a "Good Bless America" ​​type program of inspirational stories, old-fashioned values, earthly characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenes and well-written humor and drama. It's a show where the whole family can enjoy and take advantage of - without worrying about bad language, "adult" themes, cruelty, violence, etc. We've always felt blessed when we finished seeing an episode and not can wait to see every single time when they are finally released on DVD!
