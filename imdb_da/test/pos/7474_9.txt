I saw this movie by accident in Paris. I accidentally went into the wrong theater, and when I realized that it was not an example or a short film, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job of keeping your attention on her plays. I can't say enough how impressed I was with her portrayal of this true femme fatale. The rest of the molding also works very well. Don't make me wrong, this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but since I didn't know anything about it, I was back with a lasting and very positive impression. Finally, no French French in France paid for once! I didn't stop talking about this movie for 3 weeks after seeing it.
