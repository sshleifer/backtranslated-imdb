The strong, cold landscape of the Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-covered mountains beside the barren plains, is poetically used here in this Lynchian fable / slideshow of death and melancholy of the young and talented Polish brothers (as before treated Indian movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating "Twin Falls Idaho" - a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be Siamese twins. A small orphan is dying, and a city is flooding in the name of progress (in the form of a wrong and hydro power plant). With its frighteningly pleasant music score, minimalist dialogue and character development and spooky fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good movie artist knows that a movie should be about, the moving pictures ... the pictures , the scenes ... paintings of deep beauty trapped on celluloid. This is best to be seen late at night, so that haunting images can dwell in your mind and wash over you while you go to sleep. The fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with their inflated film costs and hollow films to shame and indicates something coming from the Polish brothers in the future.
