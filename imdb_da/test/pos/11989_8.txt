Great, one of my favorite movies on the bottom. Guess I can be proud not to like what "the general population" tends to go to. Jackie Mason is fun in this movie and it's Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong arm" tactics, like in Moving. He was also remarkable in National Lampoon's Christmas holiday. Love that guy.
