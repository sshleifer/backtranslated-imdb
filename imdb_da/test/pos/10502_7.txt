Descendants are about a husband and wife who experience loss in time while they love. Totally ignorant of what this bizarre experience means they are trying to continue with their lives. Her hubby begins to question the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He is going to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn child he once thought was that his and his wife actually belong to foreigners. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this is a great scifi / creepy story. Taking a very dubious real-life scenario with alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definitely thumbs up from this guy. I love all things related to foreigners, and this story certainly provided some good ideas. So if you are also interested in things outside, you should be quite happy with offspring. At least history-wise anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie overall is pretty average. With average plays by all actors. Yep, even by the consistently awesome Mr. Dourif, still providing the best performance. Even though the black chief doctor delivers his lines really well. There are a few points in the girl, where some of the supplies are worthy of ringing or laughing, which is fine in my book. I like them cheesy, and it had a little bit of good smelly cheese, and I mean that in a good way. <br /> <br /> Anyways, with a less than star script, you can't really blame all the actors. I didn't care about the mother hysteria, the movie went to. She wanted a baby so bad that she would neglect and dismiss everything she loved husband (who is a doctor !!) told her. It almost reached a point where you didn't really care about what happened to her. <br /> <br /> Descendants are another flick of Brian Yuzna from the icky-sticky film, Society. Again he delivers some slimy effects, and again he delivers a rather unique story of horror. If you are into scifi / horror or are a fan of Dourif and Yuzna movies, there is no real reason not to check this flick if you get the chance. A generous 7 out of 10.
