This movie moved me more than I expected, and I was fully prepared to cry. The actor mainly performed this film, with outstanding performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they killed the rest of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. Costumes and movies also became magical, but were not carried away with themselves. They did not focus, but added the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never be my favorite movie, as the title always belongs to the English patient, but it is in the top five. The story itself was well-developed and remained rather unpredictable. I didn't find out which line came next time. A heartbreaking story of mankind and war. In fact, this film was so real that it hardly appreciated in the 19th century. It seemed to apply at all times.
