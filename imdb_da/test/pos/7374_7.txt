Absolutely not just for urban legend aficionados, Campfire Tales is an often scary and always fun trip through several popular stories. It's also a movie that exceeded the (low) expectations I had. A horror movie I had never heard or read about, a straight-to-video release (given, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror movies today it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknown. Well, I want to leave the math for you. <br /> <br /> The film turns out to be an entertaining, exciting and totally enjoyable experience. The four stories are well-maintained and satisfying. The only one I felt was a little weaker, was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it almost does not give any explanation for its plot or character's actions; However, I still loved the story, its atmosphere and the ending. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too" - the excitement of it is not only tangible but also educational. I found Campfire Tales to be one of those horrors you discover at chance and then continue to recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
