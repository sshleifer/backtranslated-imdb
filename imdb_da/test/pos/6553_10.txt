Uzumaki has a very unique story and I will never look at spirals the same way again. Not really the spine sneaking horror, this movie has a dark morose, acid tour it feels. Under certain parts was it just me or did you see vortex pictures? The camera's shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild. The bizarre supernatural feeling of this movie draws you in, as the title suggests. It's about doing well, and the city is setting itself wrong to begin with. <br /> <br /> This can take a few views to sink in. A fantastic trippy movie.
