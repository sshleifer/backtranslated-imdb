Why take a very good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and replay it as a quasi-musical? And cast it with actors who are missing out on singing or dancing talent? Something related to "Showgirls" or the two latest "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is filled with unintentional grin. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud smiling in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpreting dance to the Republican Party ("Family")? Or Sally Kellerman lovingly tells George Kennedy, makes her best Cher impression as she jumps from one stone to another ("any little thing you do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van admits the strength of America's education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can't wait for the DVD release as it will hopefully include comments from Liv Ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she went in to make this movie!
