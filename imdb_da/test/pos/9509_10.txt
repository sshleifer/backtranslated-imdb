I've seen movies come and go in my years, and when I see a disaster movie, I hope I won't be disappointed. And with one, I was not least. The story of an entire country descending into the sea was a great concept written by sakyo komatsu, a novelist with intense theories on where this land goes. The characters were top notch, and although I am not Japanese, I didn't need a translator to give the idea of ​​how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good. The special effects blew me away, I was literally on the edge of my seat and looked at the tide waves of lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect.As for the acting I thought yes, it is in best case, emotions run violently throughout the movie, and I cried in the most severe scenes. For both movie guests, you don't have to speak or understand Japanese to watch this movie, you can get the idea and feel of each person and character to understand it well and to follow it together as if you are there. I hate to Shinji Higuchi to steer it, I hope he can overcome his work with another mind blowing experience. As I said, .... Great movie.
