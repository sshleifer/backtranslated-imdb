This movie was a pleasant surprise to me. In the eyes of honesty, the researchers looked so horrible at the point where Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with reservation, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had great plays, a few good plot twists, and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It is definitely worth checking out.
