I'm not really showing so much, but this one is extraordinary because ultimately the viewer gets something useful out of it besides entertainment. I don't have kids, but SuperNanny's lessons will be a great help when (and if) I ever do! My only complaint is that the show has been watered since it has been in the US. I prefer the British version, with sterner nanny approach. Is it just me or does anyone else find the American version to be a little soft ... now is the "cheek, milder" nanny? I think we need Yanks for a spoonful of sugar to help put the drug down? Still, nothing wrong with a juicy happy ending, is there?
