Running Out of Time is as close to a perfect movie as you will ever see in Hong Kong. All the elements click: A fantastic script (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) who even manage to undermine Johnnie To's weird clich√©, reliable imaginative direction, and excellent key performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter showing his great comic timing to wonderful effect without crossing the line to parody (especially in his enchanted reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiation skills). The support molding is also fine, with Yo Yo Mung with a strong impression in a small role, and even the often histrionic Waise Lee (looks remarkable and very appropriate as a bald Andy Lau) reining it for a good effect. It is best not to know too much about the plot going beyond the basic set-up ?? With only a few weeks to live, Lau goes into a criminal game with Wan's chief of police with no apparent appearance ?? and just sit back and enjoy the trip: it's definitely worth the price. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent films and is played in just three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments in filmmaking I've seen in ages). There is also a nice score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun to play cat and mouse on film this year.
