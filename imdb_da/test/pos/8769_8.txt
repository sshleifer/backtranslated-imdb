Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (not confused with another Hitchcock movie, "Sabotage" made in 1936, which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense's greatest movie. The dose does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) or the exciting atmosphere of "Rebbeca" (1940), and it certainly does not have the emotional influence and actor talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but What that dose has is excitement, adventure and a nail-biting climax. The two drivers are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for Robert Cumming's role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role taken by Priscilla Lane. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (written by Dorothy Parker) are dated badly, and the meeting with the circus troupe is poorly done (the beard of the bearded lady is clearly false). The last half hour, however, is the edge of your place, the climax of the Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd, are very good, and the beginning of the fire on the Aircraft Factory is a fantastic order. This is not the best movie Hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining.
