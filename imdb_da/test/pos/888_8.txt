Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the most negative responses I've heard about it and the suspiciously foggy DVD release, I couldn't help getting it - a wu xia movie is better than most non-wu xia movies in my eyes: D Maybe low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite enjoyable. A murderer kills a number of ministers involved in a revolution that unsurpassed the throne, and the government's supreme swordman is tasked with identifying the culprit. It doesn't take long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through long-term feedback we learn why and the history of the swordman and the assassin and the revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie is typically melodramatic for a Korean movie and is highly serious in tone - no HK-style comedy moments found here. The story can be a little difficult to follow first, but everyone makes sense in the end. The movie goes a little wobbly at the end, but no worse than a Chang Cheh movie can do, and for the most part I found it fun. The production values ​​are high, with some good movie images to capture it. The battle scenes are not up to the caliber of the better HK wu xia movies, but perhaps they are not meant to be - the games are more "realistic", recalling choreographed dance routines, but there are some wirework and occasional cgi that puts the movie in "wu xia" fashion. The movie does not have the best cast, unfortunately with the wires being a bit lacking in charm and occasionally hard to distinguish. There is a young lady in the movie that I do not think I have seen before, but gives the best impression of some of the principle thrown - not just because you see her necklace ... or maybe it is: p The film lacks the charm and the grace of the better HK wu xia movies and perhaps also the beauty, but I only want HK to do them half as well more - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that * it will happen soon, even if Tsui Hark probably still has it in him if he can get the funding and throw it. SWEDEN IN THE MOON does not come on my list of favorite wu xia in any way, but it is a whole lot better than romantic warriors or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe better than BICHUNMOO too, although I liked the movie quite a bit more on another view. Of course, it is nowhere near the wonderful MUSA, but it is another affair entirely. SITM will probably get another view within three years, which may be the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10
