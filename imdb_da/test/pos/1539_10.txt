This movie hits the heart with a reality like no other I've seen. It shows us what we are taking for granted in a democratic society and just what we are fortunate not to experience. The action in the movie is amazing, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life. Mr. Rickman wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) that makes the questioner full dimension and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round' theater that does not add or take away from the emotions of action. This film seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and I want to say that they have achieved success with that goal.
