I've watched this movie almost every night that was on HBO. It is, in my opinion, that it could have been successful in the theater when the advertisement led to it being on a high scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actor who played Nanny. She is an excellent actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very discreet actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony Magazine made a good article about him and gave him some of his guilty prop. Lakawanna Blue, gave me an understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They were from a similar town "Philadelphia, PA" where they had to have fun in the junior joints and such. I can also say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his call. I've seen him in several movies, where he has played a number of roles, from thug to doctor, and he has things! Overall, put the Lakawanna Blues on video for rental.
