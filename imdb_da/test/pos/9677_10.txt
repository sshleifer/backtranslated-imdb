When I first saw this show, I was 9 and it immediately became my attention when Stewie tried to call Lois on the phone at the hotel. I laughed and continued to look. When the episode was finished, I wrote the name of the comic book and saw it regularly. This differs from Simpsons and other shows on say Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV 14 for a reason. The fast movie is cut after each stroke line, and sweet, funny moves and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene are the creator and voice of quite a few characters in the show. A good theme song and a crazy family, always fun, make this my favorite comic book along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out, it's funny stuff.
