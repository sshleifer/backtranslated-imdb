Others' biggest criticism of this movie - namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish to donate his glasses - is misplaced. The glasses are just the little bit of change needed for CONVINCE others he is a Jew. The scene in which he tells his boss (paraphrase) "but you know what my background is" along with another discussion with his mother suggests that he has to fight the same assumption in the past. The glasses make him look just Jewish enough to "confirm" his neighbors and colleagues' existing suspicions. Then there is his new wife's big nose and taste for high clothes, which of course means she is Jewish. The whole point of the film is how the small stereotypical nothings become the basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes dope. If he is Spanish, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and he is easy to build, he must be Jewish. These statements all sound like (im) plausible to me. If the conclusion people jumped to in Focus was reasonable, the whole point of history would be lost.
