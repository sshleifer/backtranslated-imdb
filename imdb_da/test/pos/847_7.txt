Okay, everyone agreed what was the best season. The first. And killing Boone was a bad wish. Also killing others was bad. Infuse the directors and the authors for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys, I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series fell after the first season. However, it is easy to accept Liam as the new protagonist if you are over Boone. He's really ... mysterious. What shocked me the most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how. It was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee, with absolutely no character! But these taons remain mysterious, and you keep wondering about the right plans for the end. Real suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. I understand that when you jump into an episode from the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. But when you look from the beginning, you can just go loose! <br /> <br /> The action is amazing, the special FX is great, the music is beautiful and plotted exciting. Must see this, guys!
