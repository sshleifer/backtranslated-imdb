A letter to the guys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I would leave the room when it was on or jump on the computer as wife looked at it. This is her second favorite movie, the Godfather is the first one (I love). I ended up catching small pieces of this movie and finally after maybe a year I actually sat and watched it with her. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a big Rhett and has his cockiness down pat Whalley plays a lovely Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur, and nothing will stop her. My favorite scene is when she is abroad in Ireland and the government will tear down a farmhouse because they are behind in the rent. Scarlett gets all this crazy and pays the whole debt, making a big name for himself around this small town. All I say, guys, maybe you're gonna try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a little getting used to the new actors, but I think you will find them refreshing.
