The beautifully engaging song with the same name as the movie won the best song Oscar in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a lot of exciting things. <br /> <br /> It is the April rose that grows only in the early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is the way of nature to give a reason to live. <br /> <br /> The golden crown that makes a man a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning, two lovers kissed and the world stood still. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my quiet heart and learned how to sing. <br /> <br /> True, many love things. <br /> <br /> How can we forget a beautiful song. Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this movie and the very underrated movie "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but she could also have been nominated for Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is just as great as the war correspondent sent to report on the Communist Revolution in 1949 China. His love for Jones, an Oriental doctor, was endearing and so memorable to see. <br /> <br /> While the end is not satisfactory, this is still one of the greatest romances ever put on display.
