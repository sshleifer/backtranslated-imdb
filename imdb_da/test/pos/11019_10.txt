I have seen this movie time and time again - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does a great job of portraying Marcy (and I'm glad Kate Winslet and the other lady broke down her part). It's just one of the rolls you know no one else could have compared. <Br /> <br /> It's a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in gall situations that go together. They stand side by side no matter what, even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to tell you all - out of all I've shown it to me 'D says the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!
