Like another poster called Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed this several times over the years on Saturday afternoon. They paired it with the first successor "Ginat Majin Return". <br /> <br /> Now I haven't seen it since then ... but it never left me. Apart from the terrible dubbing and faded color, this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, it's not horror ... until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village that is dominated by an evil man. There is a huge stone statue there that the villagers continue to ask to help them ... to no avail. But things go too far, the law comes to life and destroys the evil guys ... but then it starts to go after the good guys too! Well done with some great special effects at the end (LOVED how to relax the biggest bad guy). There was also an enchanted forest, which was also interesting. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece, but an unusual combination fantasy / horror movie. Worth catching - but not if it's the copied print.
