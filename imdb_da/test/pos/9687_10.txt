If you are a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY videos, you already know what you are in. But this is one of the rare events when a sequel is better than the original! And man packs this movie a very low blow. But I mean that in a good way. It's the same type of death-killing, gut-wrenching insanity that we've all come to know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with even more grin than ever before! With Johnny Knoxville's crazy tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love of harassing his friends / family and Steve-O's gross-out factor has a hell of a fun movie. The bar of the Jackass crew's stunts, sketches and general chaos has been raised. Jackass 3? Doubtful because it is almost impossible to improve on perfection.
