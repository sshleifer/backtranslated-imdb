<br /> <br /> There is something about watching a movie in a good old-fashioned movie house that adds immense appeal to each picture. Fortunately, I could watch the New York City Film Forum a couple of Ernst Lubitsch comedies during their three-week tribute to the legendary director. The double feature I participated in was a screening of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Pre-Code Classic Design for Living, which I had not seen before. Everything I read from Design for Living praised the movie, but I couldn't find a good review anywhere for Bluebeard's eighth woman. Leonard Maltin disliked it. Videohound also gave the comedy a low rating.its IMDB score was not free. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) blasted the movie in his scathing review. So when I walked into town that day, I was just waiting to enjoy Bluebeard's eighth wife and love Design for Living completely. Bluebeard's eighth wife (who first appeared) began when the eccentric people filling the cinema took their seats and their thirties music. "Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Ernst Lubitsch's Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," the title briefly reads. Then opened the picture with a fun scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajamas but he doesn't want any part of the bottom! He comes into the gap with the clerk who seeks help from his higher bosses, and theirs seems to be no end to the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the thirtieth cinema's most beautiful, charming and talented personalities. "I'll take the bottom," she kindly brings. And maybe you have screwball comedies finest `meet sweet 'ever. The movie kept my interest wonderful. I found myself laughing almost constantly. When Colbert discovers just before a family portrait is taken, her bridegroom has been married seven times, the entire theater has entered into hysterics. When she deserves money immediately after she comes across her shock, the laughs (which still have not ceased) intensify. And Edward Everett Horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the manuscript as well. When Cooper takes inspiration from Shakespeare's Shaming Taming in the Disciplining of his wife by relaxing her face, I couldn't control my laughter when she hit him back. And the drunk scene with scallions is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comics. The biggest comic moment in the movie came when Colbert claimed a boxer to "teach his husband a lesson." In pure screw-basketball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, but puts his friend David Niven in a cold sleep. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. To cover the situation, Colbert puts in a moment of strong sexiness, his hands up to Niven and asks, "Where has that man hit you? Here? Right here? Right here?" and then BAM! knocks him out again! The movie was wonderful, from the beginning to the end it was a perfect joy. I loved Design for Living too, although I dare say I'm thinking of pure laughter and entertainment. Bluebeard's eighth woman was the better and more enjoyable movies There is some charm to watch a vintage movie on the big screen, and in others who laugh, you feel more comfortable doing themselves, which is why I felt the way I did at Bluebeard's eighth woman .
