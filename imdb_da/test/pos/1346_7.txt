I saw this night in Fort Lauderdale. Overall, it was fun, and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The plot is good and the story was OK, except for the end, which gave way to many strict dangling, and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done much better. <br /> <br /> The movie played out ruled life really well and we laughed all the way through. It's wrong, it's safe, but for a first time movie to Ash Christian I thought it was good. You may be able to wait for the DVD on this one. But if you get a chance to see it, give it a shot
