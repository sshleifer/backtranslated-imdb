Gene Roddenberry never let his fans come down. His death ended Sci-Fi heritage, which is never matched. Earth: The final conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well-written and carefully produced, but somewhere along the way, Roddenberry's touch was touched. The loose lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) has certainly damaged the series as he was an important part of what made it work. The story involves mankind being visited by Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race that doubles as 'The Companions'. After 3 years, they have given the earth new technologies, useful information about the universe and much more. Many ask their intentions here on Earth. The main link on the ground between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is to many, the most credible Taelon. Questions arise: just why are they here? What are their goals, is Da'an aware of any suspected plot against humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industry Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who exploits his millions to investigate Taelon's. At the end of the first season, it goes well, Da'an seems credible, Boone helps Doors in his investigation while working with Da'an and Taelon as a connection. In the middle of 2. season starts things up and the once stunning and fascinating series of spirals downwards, mostly because Roddenberry was dead and was not around to guide the producers, of which his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was a co-producer. Still, the first season remains fascinating and fun to watch.
