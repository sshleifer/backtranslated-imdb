The BBC surpassed itself with the limits they crossed with Tipping the Velvet. Previously, they have been "bold" with Dennis Potter's works, but this mini-series (as it was screened in Britain) is amazing. Andrew Davie's work is top notch - I haven't read Sarah Waters novel, but I can imagine he did it right. I comment on the weakness - most men have seen it - turned out to be a key speaker and selling point when they were originally announced. The fact is that it derives the lesbian side of society in the 19th century - a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys - that was it - lesbianism was mainly behind closed and often respectable doors. <br /> <br /> You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story' - it's actually - as well as 'self-discovery' that many gay / bee and just people go through and comment on this happening and repeat all over the time. /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet - either repeated on TV or on DVD - get it - you'll be a treat - and even the production and the movie is perfect. Just try to hide your roots in parts - as I said - 'bawdy' is the order of the day - and beware of a 'phallus' or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
