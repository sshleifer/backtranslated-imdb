I saw this movie knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a comic classic. It is so stupid at times that it can only be fun. Farley is brilliant as a bumbling idiot who goes to the road with her father's right hand (the equally good spade) to find the means to save the family's auto party business. Relax, put your brain on auto-pilot and enjoy the fun. A great supporting cast has movie favorites such as Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
