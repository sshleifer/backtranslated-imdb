Definitely one of the most hilarious movies all the time. Excellent original music, clever, cheerful ... it's hard to be articulated about something, it's good. There is not a sign that you do not immediately love to see - Myronex "Putney, there are problems in the black room!" "My name is Rufus." The lines, wasted left and right, are classics themselves, reminiscent of Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not of the formal set-up punchline variety. "Putney, Myronex called you tasteful!" "My organization is prointegration ..." "Where's Lopez?" He's in my head "" They don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I've read reviews that call this movie racist, which couldn't be further from the truth. Every scene is gold, from the Etherial Cereal commercial to the brothers in the Black Room meeting to the joking trumpet in the closing scene. A word - genius.
