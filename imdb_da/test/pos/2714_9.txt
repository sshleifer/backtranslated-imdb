I watched this movie in a theater in Singapore yesterday (February 4, 2006) and got away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones are going through. <br /> <br /> Ms Aparna Sen must congratulate for not only taking on a difficult subject but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their difficulties needed to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the troubles that rage in their minds. <br /> <br /> We've had Hollywood movies on this subject as "A Wing Over The Cuckoo's Nest", where Jack Nicholson bore the honors. Since then, research has helped to provide more insight into the problem and clear some misconceptions about treatment. For example, in "ghost nests," shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." it has been made that it is not as bad as it has been stated to be. <Br /> <br /> The second misconception is that childhood abuse is the cause of schizophrenia. But researchers like Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has emphasized that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is believed to have some genetic roots. It has now been established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical disorder and its advance can be controlled if it is detected early. Even in very advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding that has been shown by Ms. Then, is evident in the way the actors play their parts. In line with the theme's weight, the play is controlled everywhere with Mrs Konkana Sen-Sharma's evocative poses and eyes, reflecting the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind that is higher than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the films. who have included mentally challenged characters. <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the audience in the theater seemed confused at the sudden end. It leaves many questions related to the plot. Did Meethis search end? Why is she not found in No. 15? Were children actually playing, as Meethi stretched past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition? Can anyone sort out this puzzle?
