Oh God. Of course, when you rent or buy this, you do not expect to see a documentary about mating small rodents in their natural habitats. You expect a visual feast of blood and do and and maybe even a scare or two. Well, for those who are as sick and twisted as myself, you won't find many scary things, but you get very close to urinating yourself in laughter. The catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but we still laugh at our asses and use the catch phrases. It's as addictive and fun as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. From the opening scene, the absolutely ridiculous dialogue, to the Splatter and the Gore Department's finest works, to the wonderful film of Eden, is that you will laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast of blood and do, oh yes, they have it. And they are pretty damn at it ... "The neck bone is connected to the head bone ..." This movie may also have made the best nightmare / hallucination / widespread nuts scene I've ever seen. and it is not supposed to be fun, but you are well done (and scary.) Overall, to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a marvelous time, if you ever see this movie get it !!!! It's on Netflix, I know for sure.
