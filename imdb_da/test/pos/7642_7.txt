As a twisted road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer a walk. There is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as credibility does not fly out the window. Unfortunately, the film ultimately challenges an audience's faith tolerance. Nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this error due to the superior action, character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere. Don't expect to suffer any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play shady artists, not exactly the kind of person who is easily admired. The double crosses come fast and furious, and the last cross is a bit of a stretch. Recommended. - NOTE
