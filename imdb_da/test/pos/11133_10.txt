'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. It has all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great. It is proud of its directness and is not ashamed to be over the top. <br /> <br /> What really matters here is the journey, not the destination. Unauthorized idiots with the soap opera mentality will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggle, anxiety and triumph of these young people, not about their careers. Ironically, none of the very talented actors of 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. The end to artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It is the last sentence of a generation that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
