After seeing most of Coen Brothers' earlier films, I expected something different and weak in the center. OBWAT is definitely these things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well .. as big as the Mississippi. It is one of the most commonly entertaining films that have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, smart and well-recorded. The characters come in their countless nuances of a group of wonderful actors. George Clooney totally wins me with his Clark Gable-ish look and character. Having ever seen him in the Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo, I'm now a fan. More comedy, please George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson help a lot, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" is made for a movie, then he must be natural to play Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. I do not think there is a performance that lacks excellent from the whole role. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man. Great old-fashioned music, a jiggy type of dance by Clooney, which I am trying to learn, and a sense of depression era Southern United States enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie I've seen so far in this century. The only drawback to the movie is that it almost sent me that I broke, bought the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it .... it's so good! <br /> <br />
