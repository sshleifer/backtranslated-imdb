After reading all the comments on this movie, I am still amazed by Fox's reluctance to release a full-screen DVD version. Yes, the story may be a little inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the second movie of Fox made in Real Cinemascope, and the production values ​​alone deserve a restoration and distribution. I watched this movie in second class and it sparked my lifelong interest in all Egyptian culminating in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! Fantastic movie's power on the child's imagination, eh? In high school I read the book and made a promise to myself for a day to take the dream trip. Now this film is made in the "old school" style, which means that the Egyptians were portrayed by pink shiny and blue-eyed Britons. But has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROMA"? Everything old is olde again. One cannot imagine why today and age we still cast actors around as Mayfair aristocrats on Roman traits. Not an actor in Rome could pass for an old Italian. That said, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This movie is incredibly appealing (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BRAIN Surgery! Iron!) And its beautiful films and scores. I have a horrible Taiwan DVD version that I see over and over and ask that a true restored widescreen version be available. For anyone interested in this subject, I strongly recommend the historical novel "A God Against the Gods" by the Author of Counseling and Consent. If any of you movie buffs out there, I can contact Fox to encourage them to let me know!
