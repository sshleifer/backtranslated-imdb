Strangeland seems to have a love relationship with many of his viewers. I personally loved the movie and everything about it. <br /> <br /> The action in some places could be improved, but the film adds to the atmosphere where the play cannot. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 90s? Over all, Dee did a great job writing what I believe to be one of the most scary thrillers I've ever seen. It plays on fear of many age groups - adults, parents and children. Every parent fears that their children will be too involved in chat rooms and will meet strangers from the Internet. And it * s done in the real world. And every child and adult fear is kidnapped and tortured against their will; It also happens in the real world. That's what makes this movie a sensitive topic for many. My only warning is that if you * know * you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture, and doing, you * will * not see this movie. If you are unsure whether this movie will entertain you, read as many reviews as possible, ask people you know who watched this movie, and be prepared to turn off the movie at any time if you are disturbed.
