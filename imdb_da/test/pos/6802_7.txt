This was one of the first color films I've seen at the cinema when I was a kid. It's good to remember that. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred with the little and outstanding actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is good for all ages, good will and behavior. Good ethics for velor parents, especially her mother, is something to take into account. Our generations must be well-educated, and this film can be part of this purpose. Velvet loves the horses and drives them, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) brought her to an international horse racing competition in England, where at the end the young Velvet won, but was disqualified due to being female.
