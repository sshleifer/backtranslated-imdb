I don't understand how people didn't like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the child who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin, and many other amazing actors. Lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore. It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie that is among other great movies that Let's Get Harry. The 80s and early 90s created such great films that are never again topped by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Somehow they tried to recreate this movie in Masterminds, but came up short with some really bad actors. The only thing the movie had was Patrick Stewart, but of course that wasn't enough.
