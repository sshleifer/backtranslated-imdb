Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife, who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to enter America's heartland and start again. Along the way she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls herself 'Killer'. Soon she discovers that the good-natured 'Killer' is actually brain damage, and by fetching him she has unconsciously taken a big responsibility. The two drive all the way to Nebraska, where Sara gets Killer a job that helps out in a jungle yard. This is where Sara meets Gordon, a local policeman, and soon it goes wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or at the borders imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very freewheeling setting, the movie can capture everything that has to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, divergent role, and there are moments with some awe-inspiring actions from her. One of my favorites is when she is on the phone and calls her home to her worried husband the first time. It is such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and bend of a word so much about her talk with so little. Then comes the character "Killer" played by James Caan. This character is unlike what I have ever seen him play, and he does wonderful work. It is one of his best performances since he is very well maintained and moving. The way Coppola develops the characters by using short, dreamlike flashbacks is very clever and adds a fragmented view of it all. The fast flashbacks that are graphic and independent contrast are good with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. Also, because this film was shot in place throughout the eastern United States, it gives an interesting authentic look to America in the late 1960s. I have not seen many other films starring Ms. Knight, I'm only familiar with her recent work on television, usually playing a sneaky mother-in-law or a dotty old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It's also a shame that James Caan continued to be typecast as the 'hard guy' for the rest of his career, because this movie turned out to be capable of much more than that.
