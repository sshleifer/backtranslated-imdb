In the filthy streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends, but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercings and just party all the time. He falls for a beautiful rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson) who is also uneasy as her father is a fierce son of one you know what, but as our title people meet and fall apart, things start to become quite magical for them. Unfortunately, their fathers are at each other when Julie's father will take over Tromeo's father's film studio, but could love really conquer them and stop this feud? <br /> <br /> Hilarious and rough horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and obnoxious people at Troma is a wonderful modern day take on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. This was released in theaters in 1997 and received some good reviews, for this is a dark humorous satire of the legendary story that started everything, it has got some good laugh, piercing, graphic violence, and doing as a head gets smashed on a fire . For me, this is the third best Troma movie next to the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War", which is second, yes that play may be a bit bad as some Troma flicks, but the above thing makes it up to it and it's a must see movie, if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW also looks for a few fun looks of The Toxic Avenger and SGT.
