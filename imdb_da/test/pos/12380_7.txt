The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they see in it. People are looking for a B-Grade horror movie or a "So bad it's good" movie. Jack Frost 2 is none of these. <br /> <br /> It is, to put it simply, a very good movie that is wisely hidden inside a very bad one. To see it as something other than a screw basketball comedy (slightly more fun than all three absolutely valuable "Scary Movies" combined) is to misinterpret the movie at a basic level. It would be like seeing Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions. The principle is simple; The characters from the first film, haunted by memories of Jack Frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. A new, improved Jack comes after them, now with mainly Hydro-Man's power from Spider-Man; In essence, he can quickly turn from water to snow, divide himself, multiply himself, and worst of all, he has managed to become an immunity to his only past weakness. Antifreeze. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this movie is that brain-dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) cannot appreciate the tone change for the sequel. Like Alien was a horror movie and Aliens was about action, Jack Frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror, and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment comes live action actors who earn admirably. Particularly fun among them is Ray Tooney (plays a caricature of a retired British colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (who offers a crazy, fun spin on his first performance film performance) and David Allen Brooks (takes then the serious men's role in new, completely bizarre heights). The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me. As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, betting a zero. But you have to understand, it's not a HORROR movie.
