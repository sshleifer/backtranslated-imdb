I'm probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and a guy, the story is a little for the girl, but I really thought it was a cool movie overall. All the girls in this movie are so hot and really good actresses, from Alana, to Adrianne, to Deena, to Kimberly, right down to the sweet girl playing Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big pop star fan with the lovesick songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a great job in this and seems like he's really in this movie and made it a reality. My mother liked all the older farts she grew up with, so it's fun too. I continued to think that I liked many people and wonder if I would see them again? A sequel would be cool. I rented this, but I could also buy it as I have lots of DVDs and would like to go back to see something I missed. However, I couldn't buy it at Blockbuster, so I don't know where to buy it right now, but I want to look at it. Anyway, I'm a 16 year old guy, I've already said what I know, but I'd totally take a date to see this. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my little half sister, who is 6, could see this. That's what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see. I'm sure it was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream of all the hot chicks in this movie. There's something for everyone.
