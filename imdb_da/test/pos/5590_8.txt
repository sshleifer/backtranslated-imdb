Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. She is really one of the great actresses all the time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her best-remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in "Gone With the Wind". Irene Dunne was the "official" star in the movie, but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne), can continue her studies at Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates each scene is an under-statement. From her first entrance - in a huge outbreak of effort to greet her "big boy" - everyone is aware of her. Even sitting around the tea table when she forgets Hester's existence, even forgets how she takes her tea, you know something that is not quite right. (Hester has been living there for a while.) Frances Dee is quite sweet and so in her role as the sweetest horse. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysteria and the aftermath, shows how undervalued she is as an actress. <br /> <br /> All the young casts are excellent. Eric Linden is great as Robert, the youngest son who realizes that his mother is horrible, but can't do anything about escaping from her mother's magic. Joel McCrea says at some point "paint roses on bathtubs - it's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in Robert's sexuality. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is great in any movie or genre she tried.
