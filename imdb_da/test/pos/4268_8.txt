I especially liked the end of this movie - I really felt what the characters have felt, which I think is a good sign. I was tickled on how the new lease on the record appeared - great character development there, although his "role" would probably be considered smaller. I was also impressed that the entire movie, while dark in its subject, was free of free nudity, profanity and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all be communicated (often better) to what is left, but it seems that this is often unique to truly "classic" movies and actors. Kudos to the movie maker for that.
