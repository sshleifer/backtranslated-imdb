Come back from Morocco, where my father was attached to the German Embassy when the film came out in Europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the country's beauty where Jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before they came to Goa. Sean Combs recently celebrated at a friends restaurant in Marrakech recently, Djema el Fna was much wilder these days than it is now; The stone went there earlier, Brian recorded in Tangier; So it's memories and family entertainment, and I'm glad my son will learn about North Africa watching this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is really fun; and Teddy Roosevelt as played by Brian Keith quite impressive.
