This can be my favorite so bad, it's great movies all the time. Like many pre-teen children from the 80s, repeated display of revenge by the ninja exclaimed a ninja phase of my childhood. Man, I thought Sho k. Was badass then. Jet Li could wup him with both legs in a throw! This movie features crazy crossovers that include flashdance, exorcist and Lee Van Cleef Ninja TV show. Ugh. but as one of my friends says everyone can get a good movie that makes it a real genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun blasts that are long enough to take over the body Arobics instructor to get revenge. wow. While previous commentators have met the sword flying out of the closet on the string, no one has yet metioned the powerful love scene. Where the sexy senior man corpses off his shirt to reveal a man of high hair. The fun never ends. Rent this !!!!!!
