The 1930's comedy mystery of "The Crooked Circle" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of someone who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but truly unremarkable little movie, the movie simply works because the cast under the leadership of Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both will later appear together in a pair of Hildegarde Withers movies after Edna Mae Oliver fell out of that series) and backed by a great cast by actors and actresses you know but may not know the name (therefore I do not make the missing naming). A breezy hour long trunk, doesn't give the movie a lot of meaning with wrong identity, secret passages, ghost music and people who aren't as they think. It's the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a sennat view when you're nostalgic for late-night shows.
