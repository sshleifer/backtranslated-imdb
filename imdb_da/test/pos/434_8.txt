Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Ã‰dith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dance in the movie is not at all like what normally passes for cancan. <br /> Some may oppose Technicolor costumes and bright lighting, but it gives you a clear picture of some great costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Consider Jean Renoir's love letter to Paris, where he grew up. Completely Jean Renoir movie for people who don't like his serious movies or who just like his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
