I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan ?? a cool and fast-paced story that wasn't broken down into detail. These two guys are lovely to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality of the image and the clip support the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood concepts with local `satire 'in our cinemas.
