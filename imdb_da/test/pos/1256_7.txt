Kid - At age 39, Russell Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a good job, respected (and fears), has a beautiful house and bucks money. But everything comes at a price, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I wondered why Disney did not transfer this movie to Miramax - not because it is particularly bold or edgy, but because it is clearly an adult movie. This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign, which is clearly aimed at children - it is clumped with trailers for "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (do they not go on?). But I argue. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject - rather than the typical male midlife crisis involving a pathetic jewel buying a Porsche convertible and acting like a moron, Willi's character commits some serious introspection and tackling his life. His guidance on this voyage of discovery is even at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and honestly, I didn't break). Young Rusty's innocence and sinister optimism gives him a clear advantage of splitting the truth - he summarizes Russell's job as a picture consultant: "You teach people how to lie and do as something they are not". In order for a good script to succeed, you need actors to bring it to life. Not a problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis has three times ignored W.C. Fields' role-playing warnings with kids or animals, he has luck once again, as comedic with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous. Breslin meanwhile gives a death on the portrayal of a child from everyone's childhood - who always stuck out for some reason and was picked up. We also get two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's levelheaded assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as an obvious charming anchor friend (I loved her in "Guinevere"). Kid is charming, heavy, and genuine. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
