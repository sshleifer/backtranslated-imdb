I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she is pretty good at this. She plays it dowdy, conservative, reporter to a 'T'. It's a great little thriller that keeps you guessing for quite a while. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think a decent break Traci could be a top actress. She is certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies.
