I found this flick enjoyable and involves watching and I am surprised that it is rated so poor. In fact, I can see why it is; I imagine it's fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milan who have given most of the 1's and 2's because if you put the tape into the machine and expect to enjoy watching something that either stares or both These two, so you can be pretty disappointed. Eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in them she says a little and carries less (although it is never naked if that's what you're looking for, keep it you with the embrace of the vampire). Although they are always a pleasure, it is a shame that she or Eric doesn't get much screen, but I still give this a 8. <br /> <br />
