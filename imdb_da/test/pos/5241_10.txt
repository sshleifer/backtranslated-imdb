What a mistake in stylish dialogue and / or dismissal as archetypal characterizations represents exactly how people spoke, lived and were before World War II, let alone in what years "The Big Trail" represents film. <br /> <br /> The movie took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago. Reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed out on the office and why movie dealers benefited from Wayne in B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was, in my opinion, better in "The Big Trail" and the years of Bs than most of his star become after 1939 with Ford's incredible cavalry rigology, "True Grit" and "The Shootist" who are Big Time exceptions. <br /> What a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930. Had this movie we might have had several movies with more realism and smaller lofts. It is, in my view, not just one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialogue and accurate character realization, but among the finest renderings of a passage of any kind ever put on film. It still takes my breath away. In particular, the dialogue and exact characterization of types that simply do not exist anymore. Some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture, which actually hides the greatest cultural degradation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and political division (corporatists vs main streetists) in American history, but for me "The Big Trail "represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious, but beneath them, most people wanted to make the country's mistakes and most people wanted to build a great culture and a great nation." The Big Trail "is an epic of the melting pot in motion against the American dream. Certainly the finest movie on the road I've ever seen. The subject ever filmed.
