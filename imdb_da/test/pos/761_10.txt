I thought this movie was well written and performed very well. It is a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment. Rapper Grint played the game wonderfully and has a general character for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot, and it was a sign you could almost solve. This reminded me of the divine secrets of Ya-Ya Sisters. Not using the film's actual content, but the rooms and the general tone of the film itself. "Driving Lessons" is an upcoming age story that many may find very easy to relate to because of the overwhelming mother, the lack of freedom and the discovery of herself.
