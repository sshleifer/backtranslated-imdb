The net is a great movie! It's about Angela Bennett (in a great performance by Sandra Bullock), a computer expert working for the Cathedral Company, cleaning viruses and testing games for customers. Angela is a typical nerd who does not have friends outside of cyberspace, barely takes holidays and goes out and remains almost always connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him and send Angela a disc with a strange program that has many confidential information. That evening, when Dale was to meet her, he was suddenly killed in a plane crash. On her way to Mexico in her vacation, Angela meets a beautiful guy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who turns out to be a cold blooddrop and one of the guys behind the entire disc's secret. <br /> <br /> Her life then becomes a nightmare: All her archives are deleted and she gets the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious police problems. This movie is great because it shows how we humans depend on many computers and machines (sometimes more we should) and how vulnerable we are if someone chooses to control and change our personal records without allowing us to prove error.
