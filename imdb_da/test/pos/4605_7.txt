When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I expected to find a typical "schlocky" 1950s style horror movie. The opening scene (a cemetery with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. When I first saw it, it was a nifty little mystery about an Englishman (Richard Green) trying to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, to avenge it evil count (Stephen McNally), who ruled the territory. Chaney, like the voiceless Gargon, had a rather limited role (one that reminded me of Hackback of Notre Dame, in fact), while Karloff had a somewhat larger role as Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie, and it was hard to know until the end, whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy! The castle set was magnificent, and even the limited depiction of the Black Forest was really enough. It certainly wasn't across a low budget, compared to other movies I've seen anyway. The only disappointment I thought was Rita Corday's Countess's performance. She seemed somewhat dry and did not seem to put much passion into the role. <br/> <br /> Aside from that, I found that this film kept my attention all the way through and there was enough excitement about how it all turned out to make it well worth seeing. Definitely recommended, with a 7/10 rating.
