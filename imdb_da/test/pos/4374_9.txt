This is unfortunately Carlin's last recorded HBO concert, from a series that lasted for over 30 years. While this may not be his "best" job, it is excellent, fun and thought-provoking. This recording is also slightly different from most of his other concerts that it is slightly longer than most of his other concerts. Throughout his long, productive and influential career, Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and speed jokes, towards a more humanitarian view of society and culture. His focus on the English language and euphemism increased over the years and culminated in this performance. Although I would argue that his audiobook "When Will Jesus Bring Pork Chops?" best shows his great wit in terms of language, euphemism and degradation of our values. It's bad, because Ya is totally indicative of his long conversion from a comedian to an author. If you are offended by spooky language or the church's dispute, you will probably not like any of Carlin's stand up material. But if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy this concert very much.
