Milos Foreman's original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life changed over these years, not only in the United States, but especially in this country. One of the plots in the movie was to be used in other films to come after hair, for example in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it. The characters in the movie were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that changed all the time. Overall, a very good movie, perhaps a little undervalued, though. Annie Golden's role was smaller, but she did very well. It was the movie that practically launched John Savage as an actor. One of the Chicago members played its role well, though it was a minor role.
