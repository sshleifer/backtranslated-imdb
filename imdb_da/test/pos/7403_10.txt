Okay, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is no more than a waste of film. But the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was meant to be bad and cheezy. I mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was meant as a masterpiece? Just look at the "scary" hologram on the jacket in the movie and you will find your answer. Instead, the movie that the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as fun) seemed to be a leap into the depth of corny dialogue, bad lines, and terrible special effects. And it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. It has certainly worked for me. For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled man): What makes you so much treasure? <br /> <br /> If the lump of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would utter these words in real life? Of course, no one because it was supposed to sound ridiculous! Just take a look at this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so funny about Jack Frost 2.
