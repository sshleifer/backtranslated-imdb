I've seen many many movies, and it's just been blown in my mind. The trauma, the excitement is just amazing. So I ended up loosely in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and related it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but it does not bring the core of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is brilliant and the end just leaves you completely shocked and with the question that you have to seek the answer. I just loved it! So many tracks and moves and puzzles. One of the best movies ever, hands down.
