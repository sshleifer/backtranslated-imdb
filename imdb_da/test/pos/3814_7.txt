I saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at fantasia film festival in montreal. all about it is either to tip the hat to (or completely tear off) tim burton. I enjoyed it anyway, even though it is extremely derivative. The most impressed was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe-string budget. the set design and props were inventive and original, although the script was definitely not.
