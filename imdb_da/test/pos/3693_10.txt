I found this movie to be extremely nice. I'm biased. I happen to love Kathy Bates. I found her singing an extra pleasure. She has a very good voice. <br /> <br /> Ms Bates plays Grace Beasley. The movie takes you from her doledrum's married life to Chicago to England, the home of her newly murdered song idol victor fox. There are three surviving opis sisters. She also discovers that Victor leaves a male girlfriend dirk simpson <The story takes you to some surprisingly comical and cordial situations, as Grace and Dirk develop a true love for each other, following an initial rather rude rejection on his part. They return to Chicago, joining forces with Grace's pint-big, funny sister-in-law, Maudie, to find the serial killer who killed Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the picture did a good job. Enjoy especially Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. It makes you cry. The music is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Other posters here that encountered issues with parts of this movie just have no clue. <br /> <br />
