I just discovered this unclear 70's horror movie while browsing YouTube. For a low budget effort, it has lots of compelling moments in gradual pacing, leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is a woman constantly taking off her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac is important to the story, and there is a scene with the curly-haired young man trying to seduce her who hit me, before he pulled back, she was screaming. The young nurse coming in and being hired lures herself and I'm not surprised that she made up Playboy's cover. Some characters are very annoying and some scenes seem ridiculous. For the most part, though, you don't see in the basement (that's the title I saw on YouTube) giving enough drama and chills to an entertaining B movie.
