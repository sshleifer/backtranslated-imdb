This was an excellent show. It came to PBS home in Chicago, and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) playing the teenage animal. The show dealt with topics like sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was about a middle class black family who had a teenage daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I can remember several episodes, but the one I remember most was when their cousin got his period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first looked at it and I could keep up with the program. This was a fantastic show. I can't remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show, but I always got him confused with Kevin Hooks.
