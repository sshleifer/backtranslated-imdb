"Footprints (on the moon) are almost certainly the strangest, most horrible and most atypical Giallo ever made. It may come as a restraint for some of the subgenre fans, but this film does not contain many of the common Giallo trademarks as bloody knife killings (preferably committed by a masked murderer wearing black gloves), incredible shiny dressed beauties and unpredictable red herring. But to compensate for all this ?? and much more ?? "Footprints" benefit from the most indescribable mysterious and non-stop atmosphere I've ever experienced in this type of movie. The level of mystery in this movie is so high and tireless it makes you literally uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why, and this feeling of complete powerlessness is undoubtedly the main strong point of the movie. As a viewer, you want to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply cannot. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her calm and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize that she has absolutely no memory of the previous three days. She finds a worn picture of a hotel located on the Gama holiday island and decides to go there to investigate what happened. On the island, more people, including a lonely little girl, seem to recognize Alice, only she used the false name Nicole, wore a red-haired wig and acted as if she were coming to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has reviving dreams of astronauts jumping on the moon's surface and a rude researcher called Dr. Blackman. Plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slow brooding, and especially the cosmic subplot is really hard to link with the rest. Alice assumes they are just pictures from a Sci-Fi movie, so long ago, which sounds like a reasonable explanation, but you feel that there is a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events. Fans of excitement and stylish Italian cinema can't afford to miss this movie, really. This is the director's Luigi Bazzoni's psychological tour-de-force, with staggeringly beautiful photography and mind-changing music. Despite the lack of violence (or perhaps just because of it), the movie is genuinely disruptive, and the mental pain Alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well. As is unfortunately often the case in the Gialli cinema, the climax suddenly comes quite abruptly and hardly gives a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you've just seen for the last one and a half hours. The content of "Footprints" will still keep you predominantly long after the movie is finished and its strong impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. The prominent euro-cult star Klaus Kinski also receives top-billing, but his role is just an extended cameo. This movie is actually much better than Director Bazzoni's more acclaimed (and much more easily available) Giallo "The Five Cord", so here's hoping "Footprints" will soon receive a fancy DVD release as well.
