I must admit, I do not expect this to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play the slide and sing too. <br /> <br /> Cinemark of Beaver County PA often does. They advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited to see it, and then disappoint you by not showing it ... <br /> <br /> I expect it with such a big cast of Jackson and Ricci and even one formerly N'Syncer (Timberlake) that this movie would at least have appeared for a week. But no, at that point, if I remember correctly, MI3 showed up on 3 screens (that or another kind of supposed blockbuster). Like the Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this movie incorporates the mystery and legend of what blues music is all about. Passion and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell dogs from the past. Save. I think so many elements go into the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> This was just a good whole story. Of course, not many people will see it because it does not have pirates or swinging spiders. But it has Samuel L. Jackson ... Think about what happens to Jackson's character from Pulp Fiction after he walks the earth and sits down, and it essentially describes him to a "T". <Br /> <br /> Big and undervalued, but aren't all the good ones anyway?
