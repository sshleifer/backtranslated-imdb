This is a good movie, I will not go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of it. However, I disagree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. It's just not a very prudent position based on the amount of strong movies he's directed and starred into. I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never again appeared in another movie or TV show, despite giving good performances. My curiosity has wondered what happened to these two actresses?
