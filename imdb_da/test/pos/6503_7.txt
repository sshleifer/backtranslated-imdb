This movie is mainly for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, especially turntableism, as was the case with the director before starting this movie. It was cold to focus on the bay more than expected, because NY always gets the whole credit, but coming from the bay, the Q-Bert worship is a little out of control. This movie did not introduce anything new to me, but it changed my mind by going into it. I was outlined about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. This movie should convince someone that it's just up there with viola and clavichord.
