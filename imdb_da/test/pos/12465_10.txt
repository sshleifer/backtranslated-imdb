.. especially of lambert This is the main Burroughs Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a kid. I've read a few negative reviews on this movie and couldn't fail to wonder what their problem was. They obviously didn't see the movie I did or they expected something that was more akin to the Saturday afternoon series. <br /> <br /> This was Tarzan, who was of the novel, and the filmmakers were applauded to tackle the source material and take it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. This was a movie that he shines in. <br /> <br /> The photography and the monkeys made by Rick Baker both were amazing. You have certainly felt the side of the jungle. The second half, Tarzan's attempt to become civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had had to resolve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
