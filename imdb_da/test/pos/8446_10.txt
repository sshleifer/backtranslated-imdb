>>>> Author: msgreen-1 from Canada >>>> The big problem was the "China Syndrome" requirement - that if the reactor malfunction occurred and radioactive waste leaked, it could burn its way straight through the land to China. Many people have made fun of this and if the filmmakers meant it seriously then yes, it should be fun. The spill would not make it anywhere near the center of the ground or even the molten stone. Although it made it the center of Earth, how would it go out in China? It would have to go against gravity the rest of the way! Also China is not the opposite of the world, the Indian Ocean is. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br /> This point is brought up by the film's characters and says that it could not, of course, happen as the core would hit groundwater and release a radioactive cloud raining down on the population. <br /> <br /> Before trying to find a weak spot in the movie, you should see it first !!!! Don't judge a book titled ...
