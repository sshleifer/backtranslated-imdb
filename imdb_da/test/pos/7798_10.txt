I find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating. It is undoubtedly one of the best comedies ever made, and certainly the best Bollywood comedy from the 90s. The movie didn't do too well at the cashier's office, and people had diametrically opposed reactions after seeing it. My guess is that most people didn't expect to be an all-out comedy and expected a regular movie. If you love comedies, this is a must-see. And Aamir Khan is excellent.
