First of all, I want to say that Ang Lee did a very good job on this! I saw it yesterday, and I was currently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say "This sucks people can't fly!" to them I say it is fiction and that it is. This should not be seen as a film about reality, one can say that this is an "adventure". And a very pleasant to see Asian adventure. The picture can actually blow your mind. Because there is so artistic filmed, Ang Lee has a lot (unapreciated you might say) great talent. The fighting scene is very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer. But it is sad, but this film did not get the recognition it should have received. Fortunately, however, Ang Lee got the attention he deserved with his fractured rock. So even for viewers who are not interested in history, the pictures are entertaining enough!
