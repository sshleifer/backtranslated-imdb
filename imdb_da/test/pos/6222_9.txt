A wonderful film in the best Scandinavian Eldritch magic tradition, with very long-term perception of many of the big problems we have just started to meet. <br /> <br /> Must be mandatory display for all politicians. <br /> <Choose from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. Reminiscent of Thoreaus' Walden, but with modern twist and great humor. <br /> <br /> I'm not Finnish, even though I've traveled there and have good Finnish friends, but I found it completely accessible and also culturally informative.
