This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking movie. Yes, there was some sound and speech introduced in his previous film, MODERNE TIMES, but it was still a quiet movie. So it was not until 1940 that the public heard Chaplin talk about movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredibly famous and has a spelled reputation. As I enjoyed the movie, I was not so impressed with this as full-length Chaplin's full-length movie from the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I really felt annoyed by some of Chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he gave his speeches. The stupid pseudo-dialogue just seemed like something less comedian would have used (like the three stooges). In addition, it is difficult for me to play a fun Hitler. <br /> <br /> But when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he was not very funny (he wasn't really supposed to be a fun character) but he was a huge voice for reason and decency. This movie should not be remembered as a comedy (especially as it does not really stand out there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The shave's final speech (imitating Hynkel) is brilliant and has almost tears in his eyes. Watch the movie for this reason alone.
