I like the shepherd! Sure the play was not good, but fighting scenes were good. Van Damme throws some good kicks and it does adkins too. The story was average. A Texas police officer smuggles. This movie did everything a van pond movie had to do, which is martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van Dammme's last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you can't get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is a great martial artist and unfortunately, the public is tired of martial arts stars, but his film in this movie is amazing. Van Damme delivers strong kicks and it is good to see him perform martial arts again as he has not been in his last 4 or 5 films. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you are a van pond fan.
