When I watch this movie, I can't help drawing the comparison between it and Wild Reeds, another thought-provoking movie about teens aged. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this movie is slow and the director wouldn't hurry. So if you want a quick fix on things, don't see it. This movie is like a piece of life, begins incompletely and ends incompletely. There is no solution to anything, not happily ever for anyone, like real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it gets. The action is surprisingly good. The director is fond of long, really long shots and the actors and actresses excel in showing subtlety and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I hardly saw it, but now I'm very glad I did. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
