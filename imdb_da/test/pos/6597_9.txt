This movie was amazing. It is a documentary on how surfing affected skateboarding in the early days. It has interviews with skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) =), and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a so-called "ghetto" part of California, where it used to be an amusement park that was demolished. People started driving along with the park's dangerous ruins. Soon the Zepher Surf team was formed. It led to Skateboarding's first real start in Dogtown. Z-boys were a team of ragtag teens who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as host skating. They started it by skating in drained pools. It's just part of the story behind it. It even contains rare footage from Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta, who makes a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. It will teach you that skateboarding was not always popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
