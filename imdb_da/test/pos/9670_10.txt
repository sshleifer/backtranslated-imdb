This is the biggest show ever made next to south park. I love this show! It's so much fun, and Peter's laugh is fun. You should see this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows all the time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to see some of the later episodes I dream about Jesus, or Tales of a third grade nothing. But there has never been an episode I did not like. All the episodes are absolutely fun. It also has a good satire. You can find many clips on your tube. If you are somewhere near a computer or TV, watch it right away, but you can.
