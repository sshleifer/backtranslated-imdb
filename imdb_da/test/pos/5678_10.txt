Went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London. We didn't know what to expect, the poster gave some of it away, and I don't want to say more to not spoil the plot, but we found it to be a great movie with great acting, compelling plot and scary hell! After doing some research on the film's production, I must leave them to the guys, the filmmakers, the actors, the authors, etc. To have collected such a film with such limited resources. After-production very well done too. For all that, I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they will continue their fine work. Keep it up, guys. You rock!
