The reason I think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. From the script and the amazing play you can tell that there is a story behind all the emotions that are. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why they are not doing others. You can feel sympathy and joy and love and grief for them all at once. You see humanity at best and in the worst case. You can relate to the characters, because even if you have never been in their exact situations before you see the qualities and the fallout in them that you see in yourself. To some extent, this film kind of tells you, but ultimately it explains itself, and you feel some peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I would say that I have never ever cried so much in my life or got so much out of anything. I ask you to watch this movie and take it for granted. That there is only one true thing and that is ... love.
