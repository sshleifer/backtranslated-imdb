I just finished watching this movie for the first time and I have to say I am very impressed. How grim. How full of despair. How nightmare. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, more scenes are embedded in my mind ... The first appearance of fantasy ... David's soul as it rises from his body ... his spirit on his knees plagues. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a simple story - the ghost-driven ghost driver, convicted of collecting the souls of the dead for a year - brings it into the current movie setting and then uses flashbacks as a means of explaining how David Holm ends up in his difficulties. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this released on DVD so more people could see it. Everyone must.
