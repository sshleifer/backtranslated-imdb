"Zen and Art of Lanscaping", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends he calls Zen) and what arises on a strange day in his life. Zen acts as a lancecaper for a middle class family. The house lady is trying to get Zen to help her cheat on her husband. Unfortunately, her son goes into them instead of her husband. From this point, the film begins to accelerate through many revelations between the characters along with the possible involvement of the house man. "Zen and Landscaping Art" is witty, smart and generally very well written. The actors' comic timing is also very strong. It's a fun, light movie that I would highly recommend.
