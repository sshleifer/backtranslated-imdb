Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever mourned, reads Philip K. Dick, believed that Matrix's premise was better than the specialty, has an interest in philosophy, or likes to have their sense of reality boasted. I laughed aloud at this movie just because it was so scandalous and so spot-on. This movie is amazing. This movie is cool. It's better than the matrix of a long shot (I didn't fall asleep in Existenz for a kick off: the action / special effects movie drills me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical sheen, that's exactly what the matrix is). Existenz is rough, it's disturbing, and it's fun. David Cronenberg has made some shonky things (Rabid) and also some geniuses (Videodrome is another worth checking out, like Stephen King's adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favorites. I can't remember the end - which is a good thing because it means I can see it again. Or maybe I have never seen this movie at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it really happened to me. I do not know. At least it's now seamlessly sewn into my overall illusion of reality, and I'm happy.
