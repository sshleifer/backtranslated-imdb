At the front, every teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are a few who have surpassed the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join the depressing rare crowd of teenage comedies that are actually funny and not just one excuse to blink some starlet's boobs or be a vehicle for some never-was like Tom Green. Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack pal Steve Pink and led by it looked like Justin Long (the smart nerd kid in Galaxy Quest and more recently highlighted in Apple computer ads), about a bunch of children who are not accepted to college and decide as described in the trailer, fake a fake one to get their parents off their back. When they go a little too far with the website and other children end up signing up, the kids have a few problems solving. <br /> <br /> Okay, the setup is obviously confusing, but most comedies live or die in performance, and Accepted accepts quite well. Long's Bartleby Gaines (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by some well-meaning, comically acceptable friends to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting sign 'Dean' Lewis (undoubtedly named as a tribute to Rodney) Dangerfield's Dean Martin), also Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, is wisely limited to short spurts, where he can quickly burn off his unique brand of sharp observational humor. Black is great here, frankly telling the kids how life really is (his explosive-laden endline is hysterical) and gives the adult face to the false university of parents. <br /> <br /> But Long must wear most of the movie, and he does in spades Bartleby is easily identified and we go to him almost immediately. A good twist was provided by Columbus Shorts character Hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship because of an injury and ends up being the de facto art faculty of the fake college. Also notable as Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is Hannah Marks. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie feels familiar in some places; There is a debt that is due, in all places, to the revenge of the nerds. Those rejected by everyone else find a home with Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course, the bad guys are steroid-reinforced conformist Master Race types who run a fraternity (okay, phrase is evil) and try to humiliate and bury the odds balls for ?? gasp ?? Crime to be different. But aside, Accepted has fun with the material, and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations of school children and higher education. Not that it is a brain teaser in any way, but Accepted is not just another mindless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson vehicle). It's a fun and smart 90 minutes that is not a good departure from its genre, is intelligent and creative enough to be very fun. There is at least a moment of unparalleled brilliance in the movie when Bartleby checks out a nearby college in an effort to reap ideas for her own school curriculum. When he sees that the kids are stressed out at the other school (more people refuse to talk to himself during the class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head and thinks there must be a better way. As he moves to leave, he is greeted by a stream of children moving toward the other, while a person is moving towards a human tide, while in the background, Eleanor plays Rigby's opening lines. Perhaps an unplanned moment of shine, but shine anyway.
