"Tourist Trap" is among my favorite late 70's / early 80's horror flicks. A group of young people are heading somewhere, a couple in the car in front, and the car is flat, and our movie opens with the young man Woody pushing the deck along to look for a gas station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and still hears voices and examines, and ends with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. At the same time, the rest of the young people (in a VW Thing) and they pick up Woody's girlfriend and find the same place, Slausen's Oasis or something like that. And then, Mr. Slausen happens together while the girls enjoy a dip in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that time, so odd Mr. The Slause (Chuck Connors) offers its help. Mr. The Slausen has a museum with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum, but behind is a large house where he says that Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, they would probably be safer. The girls are alone while Slausen helps fasten the car, but of course the curiosity is the best and she goes to investigate and finds the house full of scary mannequins and a pretty animated one called ... Davey. What follows is a rather frightening night of terror as one by one, they are captured by Davey, who says he is Slausen's brother. A girl (previously kidnapped) is treated on a plaster facial, resulting in her death when covering up her air supply. In any case, there is something of a twist to this and friendly (but weird) Mr. The Slaus is not exactly what he seems to be. A good, scary late 70's scarecrow, and many mannequins make for a very eerie atmosphere. 7 out of 10
