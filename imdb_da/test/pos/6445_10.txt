I watched this movie as a child and fell in love with it. It has a sweet sensitive story. Some children can appreciate. I loved as much as a child I had to find for my daughter. It's definitely a movie I wanted to see with kids. It reminds me of a great story of a Disney nature like Petes Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both because of live action and cartoon features, but on its premise. It is also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth, they can trust it and adults will listen to them. I think every child should see it and would enjoy it. It's such a break from the fierce movies with bad taste so many kids are watching these days. It has all the charming qualities, so many of today's movies do not have.
