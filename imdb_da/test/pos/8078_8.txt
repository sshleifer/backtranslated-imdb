Being Bill's fan, I initially found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and lost four superbowls. But when I started to see, I really felt connected. In fact, it was nice to see "Bill's" winning the superbowl and I have to say that for a television movie it was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as QB, and Jon Voight as an older school coach did a very good job. 8 out of 10
