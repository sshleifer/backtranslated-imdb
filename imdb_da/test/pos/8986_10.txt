I caught this a couple of times on television in the late 1970s. It only played late at night (past midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a friendly, happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and stands alone and full of despair. He turns to a crime scene and eventually becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his horrible moves and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He tries to go straight to her ... but he can't escape his life in crime or his hatred in his own honor. <br /> <br /> No budget B movie. Very short (runs just over an hour) but well made and excellently traded by Lorre. This has much more depth than you would expect from a quickie B image. Anchors especially takes the ungrateful "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. Unfortunately, this has disappeared from television and was never put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM recently showed it and it was great to watch the movie still stop. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
