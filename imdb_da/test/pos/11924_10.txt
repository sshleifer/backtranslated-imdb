I have loved this movie since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 when and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actress and youth murder. I am now 23 and still love this movie. The best thing about it is that the one I'm dating loves it too, because it's a total macho-guy movie! It is done with sufficient action and chaos to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen. I only wish it was available on DVD!
