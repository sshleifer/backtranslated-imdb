Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was filled with plot twists, good acting, great story and a surprising ending. To be honest this movie wasn't too gory, it contains some gore, but was more on the psychological side. I read it on the internet: The movie cost $ 3,000 and was shot for 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone who wants to think and love good filmmaking. What begins as a terrorist thriller is slowly transformed into something a little more twisted, even a little more grim. Not much I can say without giving away plot pointer only that this movie went beyond my expectations
