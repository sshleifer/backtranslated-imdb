After an approximately 7 year old stone road on NBC, it was decided to make a last super payment. The series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a blockbuster of a television hour. It had always had a significant, hard core of hardcorps of followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the full title series "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" in the series. It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of 'Rabid Ratings Ravings' over. <br /> <br /> During the uncertain mandate on Friday nights, they had presented some of the best and most bold artistic of Hourly Dramas. There I have said it artistic, artistic !! But remember that we mean artistic, but not just Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically correct sermon. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a sure thing that it was the end of the "HOMICIDE" line; This super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Look at all the recent seasons and events with solid characters, went out the production team and gave us what turned out to be a super bracing. <br /> <br /> Our story? ?????. When we join the story, we find that command officer for overall actions in the Baltimore Homicide Unit, Lt. Al Giardello, has "pulled pin", retired from work, that is. But 'G' is not ready for real retirement retirement yet. So instead of a rocking chair as a fishing rod, we find that Al drives to the mayor of 'Charm City'. <br /> <br /> While out in town, make some campaign stops and talk, the former detective Lieutenant takes an assassin Alive, but in a comatose state, he's taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> News spreads quickly, and as we officially called, we find all the detectives of the Baltimore Unit we have seen on the show and show their offers and services. There is a good meeting with all these former and current gumshoes that they run in and follow all the leaders and the opportunity to lead. The producer found a way to deal with those who had died earlier in bringing their memory into history. They managed to answer some long-lasting questions and even introduced some here to uncreated. The whole story wins the series in a most satisfying and original way. But at least for now we will leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> By catching everything in a nice little package, this TV movie definitely gets our endorsement. As for the classification "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE", we must give it an A or A +, itself. But regardless of the degree, it did not score as high as a typical weekly episode.
