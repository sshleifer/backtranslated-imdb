This is a good enough movie, and you probably won't be disappointed, but again Roy Scheider, just after he did "French Connection," played a policeman named "Buddy". They also use the same too memorable wheelman from "Bullitt". First, you think you've seen the car before, if you still have your face in your memory. The car rental is a great one, but as in many movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. Check out the "Puppet on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for some other good, long, intense chases.
