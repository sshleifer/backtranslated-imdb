I am a history teacher and generally I was happy with the film. My teenage actors enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little bad in places? Yes .. but it took my kids away from the computer and playing station to spend four nights watching it all. <br /> <br /> The battle scene was impressive and we met many historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We will enjoy the movie again!
