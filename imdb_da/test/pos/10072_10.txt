If you like Madonna or not, this movie is fun !! I am a Madonna fan and saw this in the theater at the time of the release. But over time it has not lost its misery and pure fun. Sure there are some bad lines and cheesy plays, but the whole movie is just a screw basketball comedy with Madonna that actually carries the whole movie with big bombast. She is sweet, funny and is the only comic role in her movie career. Madonna usually just plays 'herself' in roles, but looks at her as Nikki Finn in this movie, she really seems like someone else for once. Of course, the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin Dunn ('After Hours') who also brilliantly cast and have fun with material. The story is no genius and don't expect any climatic end, but if you're ever in the mood to see a fun, clean, 80-thumb or if you're a Madonna fan than this is a MUST SEE. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 Madonna songs: # 1 hit "Who's That Girl", number 2 hit "Causes a commission" and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads "The Look of Love" 10 Hit in the UK ) and "Can not Stop" a back pop pop from "True BLUE" sessions the year before. It is only on VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
