Atkinson's Rowan Mr. Bean ranks right there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh so loudly and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean through my videos and now DVDs. I never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was past a visit and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I got out of my video and showed him where Mr. Bean is in the church and begins to nod. My brother laughed hard, he fell out of his chair and kept his stomach from laughing so hard. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how funny these episodes are, but the fun is to share them with others. I've seen so many people laughing 'until it hurts! Favorite examples are: The Queen's visit, the Hotel room stay, late for the dentist agreement, the Christmas episode (a classic ... plus children love it!) And the New Year's party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
