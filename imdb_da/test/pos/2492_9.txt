My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial movie, now released on DVD for the first time in Britain, has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has distinguished himself in his arrogance and technical skills. This pseudo documentary is certainly ahead of time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the United States, where the government has increased its legitimate use of violence and oppression while the anti-war movement is increasingly violent and radical. In order to handle both this, the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to the police for cleanup, the government has introduced the so-called penal parks. Convinced "criminals", mostly activists, get "the election" either locked in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks, where they either get their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence. However, the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations. It reminded me of some kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and resembles parallels with the cannibal holocaust, which is made almost 10 years later. Both films are designed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged to think and feel that he actually sees a true documentary and therefore shocked, even though it is aware that: this is a movie. Both confront us with the inherent violent nature of mankind, but where the cannibal holocaust lacks a deeper meaning (it is primarily an exploitation film in every sense) and raises no critical questions about the state of the world Punishment Park does just that. <br /> <br /> I have been deeply impressed by the Punishment Park and have difficulty believing how such a strong and important movie could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Perhaps it says enough about the truth about its content, the way in which power structures in this world work. I do not agree with the criticism Watkins polarizes and stereotypes because the film portrays activists and users of the legitimate power structures that are actually polarized as they are here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and therefore no change in our society. In reality, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you place them between activists and establishment in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups were not to be polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities who implied tacit complaints, but at the same time residing in the world's injustices. As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on the DVD, the players in Punishment Park are mostly amateurs. Most children were real activists from LA, most policemen had been part of national forces, and even some of the members of the Tribunal are part of the social and political establishment of time. Not introducing both groups prior to the recording of scenes taking place in the improvised courtroom, adds spontaneous and impromptu feeling. Parallels are drawn with questions of time, such as the suppression of the Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic BPleader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the Chicago Seven. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere commitment to injustice and his concern over human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (today in the name of war) to silence those who do not agree and refuse to become brainwashed. The Penalty Park remains an extremely important movie to appear in schools and is seen by anyone who shares these concerns. Perhaps its marginalization can finally be made up for.
