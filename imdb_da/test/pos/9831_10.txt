I have to get old because I was riveted to this movie from the first time I saw it. I see it again right now on HBO. It's a very simple movie about 2 people falling in love after they found out that spouses had an affair. The plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas, who runs to Congress, and Harrison Ford is a policeman for internal affairs, these two adversely encounter and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $ 68 million. Where was it used? The plane crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
