If it was possible to award a 10+ .... it would be the only movie I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember catching this movie on television many years ago - and fortunately was prepared enough for video it. Now my video copy is old, video technology is outdated, and I am starting to worry that I may not enjoy the joy of this movie for much longer. <br /> <br /> As a wildlife movie it is excellent. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it surpasses something that is screened sooner or later. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is such a lobby / press group to push the re-release of this movie, count me and send me the details pronto. My guess is that there is a mint to be made by someone that could redissolve it in today's market.
