This is one of the best of the early "Star Trek" episodes, where Kirk and his crew venture into the unknown to battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racemes of Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikely characters in the "Star Trek" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr Spock is honestly resembling that of 9/11 hatred and suspicion that many Americans have of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is far too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the ultimate Federation nemesis. The klingons are unpleasant but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean that they are the ancient Romans born again in space age; Despite their Vulcanoid properties, they are clearly meant to remind us of Imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles such as "centurion" and "praetor". Chain mail armor is really cool. The acclaimed guest star Mark Lenard, who continued to play Spock's father Sorek and the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", is a suitable grizzled warrior commander, a character who has a striking resemblance to Laurence Oliviers Crassus in "Spartacus". Also, his question about the indelible thirst for the empire of conquest reminds me of similar concerns, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who was expressed at the beginning of "Gladiator". A must have for both Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.
