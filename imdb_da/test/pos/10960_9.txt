"Shadows" are often acknowledged as the film that was broken through for American Independent Cinema. Whether it's true or not, it's an unimaginably important movie whose influence can be traced entirely to today's Sundance feed. Here is a film that deals with controversial issues of the day (namely, racism) and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative manner. It is also about sex in an honest way that Hollywood would not even discuss until "The Graduate". But the question is still as powerful as today when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many important movies are hard to see and dated today, "Shadows" retains every ounce of emotional resonance when seen now. It deals with racism as a personal problem and not politically, so it is still relevant. In addition, it acts as a great time capsule that takes the 1950s beat generation and New York art scene in a way that may have no other movie. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, it is uneven. Cassavetes did not yet have full confidence as a director, and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget. Still, the film's history is still strong. Moreover, in view of the lack of experience with the cast and improvisational character, the play is phenomenal. All around, the actors create realistic characters, those who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. "Shadows" is absolutely mandatory display for movie buffs. (9/10)
