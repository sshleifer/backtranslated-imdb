You don't have to be a Tamil to appreciate this gem of a movie. I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me. Understanding a movie without knowing the language is pretty tough but I could tell the story because the leading actors (and the actresses) felt really good. And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't annoying as kids actors in most hindi movies). The story really touches and hats Mr. Ratnam to try something else. The relationship between the parents and their children appears quite realistic. (I could identify with the characters in the movie). It was entirely a movie that will stay in my heart forever and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Also the songs are just out of this world! They were beautifully and meaningfully pictured. If I could only understand the correct meaning of the texts :(
