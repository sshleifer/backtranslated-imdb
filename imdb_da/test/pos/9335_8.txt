It can be a little squeaky now, and it can certainly never have the influence it once had, but it's still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could do. Looking back on it for the first time since its first appearance, I was not hit by horror - quaint but fun, and Vincent Price never sounded so real, un-camply (sic?) Threatening - than its inclusion of the horror movie, that allows Jackson, behind genre and make-up, to give us a courageously revealing portrait of male sexuality. Because THRILLER is not really about horror, in that way, horror is not really about horror: It is about the age-old theme, a young woman's sexual awakening. The movie opens in a movie theater, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the picture and the aggressive gender response. Of course, she is on a date, and she is less afraid of the movie than what she knows will be expected of her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The general images of the movie they see, the group's atmosphere suggests the socially conditional expectations. This not only causes her to think of the body in disgust - hence all the overdue ghouls; The loss of her virginity is considered a kind of death - but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend, but for her peers, her community and hence her visualization as a bandwidth. <br /> <br /> These are brilliant, disturbing things, the best ever that Director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the firm image of a star contained volumes, not all of them soothing. The song itself has been remarkably good, the creepy, insistent bass rhythms, the exceptionally sweet lyrics, the beautiful 70's disco ecstasy that speaks the chorus, crushing timelessness, and revealing the milky desire behind the fear.
