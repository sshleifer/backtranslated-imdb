Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and sad so many predictable films, I was very pleased with the script, showing so many small stories and signals scattered here and there. Directed with black humor and taste, I loved the excitement between Boggart Rickman itself and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows at his best. Gugino is remarkable.
