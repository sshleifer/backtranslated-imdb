I had been waiting to watch this movie for so long and finally came to yesterday. In conclusion, I finally welcome. The humor is away from the hilarious wall. The reason is so incredibly credible that it must have at least one truth to it. If something was in this movie, it is definitely the coffee shop. I've been there every guy has. You get dumped. You find out that your ex has fooled around with a guy that you are sure is an asshole. Now every time you see something for the next few days, you just get horrible thoughts about this placed in all the wrong areas. She screws everyone and everyone knows. I could probably see the man licking and fingering his wallet all day long and looking back at myself and laughing for being there too.
