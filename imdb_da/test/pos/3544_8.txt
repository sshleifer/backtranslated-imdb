Guess a couple of upscale movie directors sat around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice one night in the 80s during Cannes or other film festival, and one said "Hey, guys, let's make a movie where we each create one segment around a world-class aria. "Welllll ... that kind of work. It was clear that someone was smart enough to choose some of the best recordings of the chosen arias, such as Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor, just listening to the DVD, you got more than yours worth the money. Not all directors succeeded, but more did not, and the girl seems to be improving with every view over the years. My favorite is the scary beautiful love duet from Die Todt Statd; okay a young nude elisabeth hurley is the eye like that, but her husband sings to her, his wife's ghost, is incredibly beautiful with love music only to Otello and desdemona's "gia nella notte densa" in all the operative repertoire. Could the girl be better, surely what could not have been, but it is worth seeing especially if you are in a hyper-romantic mood.
