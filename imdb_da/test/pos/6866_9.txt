This movie will send chills down the back even if you don't understand German. I saw the first in my German class in high school and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 times since * this was just a few years ago * and it's great to watch a movie night. The softened bodies are mostly genuine, used from Body Worlds. This movie was a rage to it. A German Dr. * the nickname Dr. Death * began to soften human bodies for display, and now Body Worlds is a tournament right now in Chicago IL. Many people were against this and then a great German horror movie was made. I personally love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes thriller slasher movies.
