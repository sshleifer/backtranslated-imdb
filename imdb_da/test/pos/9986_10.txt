I'm not the golfer in any way. On May 26 at 22:30, the film started with a scene in the late 1800s. Old movies I like, but not golf, but in the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) of men's voices awakens. He goes outside to ask what they are doing and is told to build a golf something ... Then I turned off the television, but something touched me and it was again. The movie is excellent. We see this young boy now a man; professional golfer who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the film Francis True Focus and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet with his mother and father who will protect him from class things that are so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushing that contributes to Francis wins. Don't want to give away too much. I was until 2 A.M. This is super, watch the movie.
