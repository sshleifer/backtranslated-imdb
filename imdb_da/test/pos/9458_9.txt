When I went to watch this movie, I thought this would just be another pretty girl I had to endure with my sister. And also for Amanda Bayne's last movie, it wasn't so hot so I doubt the movie because she's the leading actress. But within 5 minutes I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "out there" that it took more then a second to understand it, but much fun. The scripture was not too complicated that I could not understand the love triangle, but was very true to Shakespeare's original play. I loved every minute of it so much that I kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol !!! very embarrassing! I would definitely advise people to watch this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot !! (lol) so much that I might just get it on DVD.
