this is about a violent detective who is fighting for a couple of young rich children who have nothing better to do than to plan a complicated murder and cover what they seem to overcome police force apparently at will. They speak detectively by planting tracks and directing them to a wild goose hunt. this one has a decent plot with a few good phrases at the end of the movie, Sandra Bullock does a fine job in this as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and struggling with her inner demons, she can't seem to hold a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to hold her for some reason. All in all, it's not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing all the way to the very shocking end.
