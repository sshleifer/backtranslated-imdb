It's hard for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a lot of Shasta Daisy's in the backyard, which I lovingly call my "Chuckle Patch." My friends laugh at me and look at me as I have 2 heads. It would be great to see this series on DVD for us people who remember it with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch! Where children TV today is composed of violent cartoons, characters that make magic or a talking sponge living in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was right in that it taught us good values. <br /> <br /> I want to keep good memories of Carole and Paula and Chuckle Patch.
