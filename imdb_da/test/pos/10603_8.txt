I didn't know what to expect from this. I have always considered Bam Margera and the CKY crew a team of crackheads dedicated to doing stupid things for entertainment. I didn't know they could act. But everyone who appeared in this movie took good ideas. Greetings of 'aaaaagh!' scene blends in with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. At times, the movie looks some scenes meaningless, but at the same time they are funny. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh, but this movie can't appeal to those who prefer detailed stories and a number of winds.
