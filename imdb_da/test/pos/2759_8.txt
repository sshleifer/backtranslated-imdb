This game is very good for n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe some more skaters. The game does not have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Now, however, the gameplay is fantastic. The level of School II is a good level with so much to skate. In career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other different things in 2 minutes. A skater is created that is pretty cool. I made a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black guy with an afro and a girl board. There is a park editor, some cool prized parks, free skate, and there is a single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can see replays that are always cool. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not that good. Well, they're good at a n64 game. I wish I had a controller package so I could store my data. Overall, this game is great. I give it an 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's just as fun as the n64 version, but a little hard to control. I give it a 7/10 for GBA. Then go out to a place that still sells n64 games and downloads a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
