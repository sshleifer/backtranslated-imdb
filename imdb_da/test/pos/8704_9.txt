I was ten years old when I saw subspecies, I instantly had the heads of Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really have a great screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. I ordered a copy back in 1993 from Full Moon, and I learned this: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much larger roles in the manuscript along with the king. What most people do not know is that there was an alternative sequence that would happen at the end of the scene: Michelle and Stefan turn into a room and Michelle has the idea for Stefan to make her a vampire to help fight against Radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. But for some reason, the scenario has never done so on the camera. Another scene in the manuscript, which can be confirmed from the original trailer, shows Stefan that he is drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer, he sees him coming up with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood, and I have good memories associated with the characters; Although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hoves Radu is pure emotional action, so much feeling in his work there.
