We really love movies and soundtracks "Valley Girl". I owned it on video for eons and had the original soundtrack out. I have several friends I come with, and we have "80's Raves" - parties where we come together and play 80s music and run "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we are all in our 30s now. We have an AWESOME time. <br /> <br /> It's all in good fun, as, do you know?
