This movie was so well-functioning that I didn't think I was actually blinking while I was watching. An intense situation after the other kept me glued to the set. But I would have liked to see Corey Feldman much more in this picture. He just steals all the scenes he is in. This could be my favorite adult Corey performance. The end was clever and unlike other movies that go away from separating body parts from similar bearings, this film goes to it! I liked that it wasn't graphic blood and did but left more for the viewer's imagination. Bravo. I literally had to dry sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. Ultimately, the film works because of its sympathetic main character and the amazing presence of my all-time favorite bad guy, James Remar (48 hours, remember?) I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to break a sweat. <br /> <br />
