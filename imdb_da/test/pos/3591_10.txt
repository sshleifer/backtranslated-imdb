As a SCUBA diver, I appreciate the incredible physical strain that cameramen must have endured to get the shots underwater. However, this series is much more than that. The story is perfect, the scenes border on the unlikely and the subject confusing. The daily struggle for life that takes place out of our terrestrial resident's perception is fun. This DVD set has opened my eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I urge everyone to see this series.
