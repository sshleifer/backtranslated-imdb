This was one of the most emotional movies I've seen. Passion, joy, pain, despair, sorrow, healing, cleansing and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spell binding. Everything was done so well; The adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera pictures. <br /> <br /> This movie touched me deeply in so many ways. It reminded me of the despair that loses your love can have and the time it takes to heal that wound. You may have to love again, but will always risk the pain that comes with separation. <br /> <br /> Isn't this one of the most important age-old issues? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lost? <br /> <br /> Never before loved?" <br /> <br /> -Ascension
