This is one of my favorite films that goes back to my childhood. Seen in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to descend from the mountains in search of food that characterizes additional farms. In this atmosphere, we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit trainer living in the wilderness when he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close and only a friend in the village who runs a shop. At Boris's request, Avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, Ivan, on the quest for the threatening tigers. Personality crash and temperament flare as the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting also noted by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and hunt. In a thick tree, Ivan injures one of the tigers, who then attacks the effortless man. Avakum, when Ivan joins the furious animal, burns, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills the tiger as it flies. The other hunters arrive on the spot, suspicious. <br /> <br /> Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. Stairs, however, brush them, and quickly move away with their dog-drawn sleigh. The young villagers swear to him that they will come to him if Ivan dies, which he later does, but before he dies, his father explains that it was an accident. Old Boris, after learning that his closest friend runs out of the village, offsets the "lynch mob" collection and goes out for Avakum to find him and put things right. And then the main story begins. <br /> <br /> A simple movie evokes the conflict between humans and civilization versus nature, primarily Avakum's struggle to survive alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack of Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as a few musical pieces of folk music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available for purchase, to my knowledge, which is rather shameful. The copy I own, occupied by television nearly 20 years ago, has slowly deteriorated. This movie is a must see for those who can appreciate it if they can find it. 8.10
