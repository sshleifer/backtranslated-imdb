This movie is hilarious, light and insightful. Although the story might work well with almost any ethnic group, the inherent Judaism gives extra importance to the wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues covered by the plot that alone it would have been worth seeing; - But the real treasure was in the hot laughter that spread through the valued audience. Medley of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from Shakespeare's drama that their lives seem to parody. This is a movie about family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible bond of different personalities and lifestyles, first among siblings and parents, and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a pace and a development that keeps the viewer fascinated until the final scene. Peter Falk is, as always, fantastic in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Strong performance with a fine cast includes a surprising guest. Don't miss this movie!
