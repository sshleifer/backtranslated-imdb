I lived in this area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This movie surely captures the feeling of the time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right, and the scenarios are realistic. As another poster said, it almost looks like a documentary. I like the way it humanizes these kids, who probably would have been born in Westchester, but fall into what children fall into. It just happens that the area is pretty rough. <br /> <br /> They exaggerate them quite a bit, but you can expect that. I would say that the play is also good around. <br /> <br /> It gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and blown out of proportion. Hopefully Newark's new mayor is making progress.
