The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece, and again it shows that you can make a brilliant film on a low budget, such as the American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar Alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic film because it is the largest and largest film that has been made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music of the movie, which is played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic of the movie, it is absolutely brilliant. I recommend anyone who can think to go and watch this movie as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed. I'd bet on this movie to win the best foreign film prize next year ?? across the globe!
