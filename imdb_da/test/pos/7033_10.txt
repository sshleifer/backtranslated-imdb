It was E! Hollywood Special on Making Dirty Dancing, still considered by many women, including a dear friend of mine in the fifties to be one of her favorite all-time movies. Maybe the music, dance or melodrama around Babys Frances's plot will be a dance experience with Johnny Castle. Of course, this movie established Jennifer Gray, whose greatest role so far was the vicious sister of Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart knocking leading man who sweeps the baby away away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story, the music and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick were able to revive their roles easily. It's nice to see Jerry Orbach playing a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties, where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacation. At the end of the movie, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, get confused by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. These old grand hotels become Indian game casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could make it to Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, it should be a brainer! I know this movie is one of the favorites you won't get tired of watching 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie - a 1,000 times now. Somehow one looks at doing and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me yearn for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest movie ever made in history, but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeat viewers like the 800 club whose members have seen it so many times. I see it boring now with all the unpleasant in Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as a heart palette, Johnny Castle. No one could have imagined this little movie as a big hit than with the sixties music, two soundtracks and even a tour of the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a movie. No wonder it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to see it again and again. Well, Australia and London have both had productions of Dirty Dancing. It seems that it comes to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.
