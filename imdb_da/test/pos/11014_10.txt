One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years I have tried to get it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German film / TV industry still prefers to leave valuable cultural contributions (and that's Fassbinder!) Root away and gather dust in an archive rather than distributing it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that's it stimulate them instead of promoting creative thinking). Although WDR once told me I paid DM 200.00 to check the copyright (non-refundable) and then DM 8 per. Minutes of copying plus the cost of the materials, they will consider making a (single!) Copy for me. Some way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other television films or series such as "So weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - never to be heard again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE from March 2007: Last year I finally got a DVD copy from Witts' Mittschnittservice for about 50 + Euro. Great!
