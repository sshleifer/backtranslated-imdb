Really good movie about a man and his wife being caught in murder and police investigating the case. It starts marvelously, but kind of hits a wall at a certain time. We are sure that we know what happened, then a little plot thread that first looks like a red herring, pops up and draws. Still, Clouzot's direction is great, and the play is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also appeared in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame, offers the best performance as the wise detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were affected by this movie when they wrote Fargo. Much like the movie, the police officer appears until almost halfway through, and then he almost becomes the focus of the film. There is also a lot of dragon comedy around him (although his methods often appear kind of fascist).
