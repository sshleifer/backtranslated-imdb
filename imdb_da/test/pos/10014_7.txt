"Night of the Hunted" stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie. In fact, many of the cast members in this slow motion were porn actors at the time of the boring. This movie is definitely different from Rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks, but it's not as memorable as, for example, "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination". Lahaie plays a memory rack that can't remember who she is or where she came from. Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where Lahaie is held by a kind of medical group that treats a number of people with a similar condition. In this way she avoids herself from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held. On a motorway outside the city, she meets a young man who stops and fetches her. "Hunting Night" offers lots of nudity, unfortunately the pace is extremely slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum steward Dominique Journet is well developed. Still "Night of Th e Hunted" is too boring to be fun. Just give it a look if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works7 out of 10 and it is friendly.
