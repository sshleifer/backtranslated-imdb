I still can't believe that computer graphics are capable of creating 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends on a forum, I swear to myself that I have to see it. <br /> <br /> I managed to see parts of it at a fellow shopping mall where they had many Advent Children DVDs and showed it on a few laptops for sale. Of course I was happy about it, but it was still not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to search for the movie. All I came up with was music video dedication. Until the fateful day ... I found it. I saw it in spite of all the disturbances, because I knew I had to look, otherwise I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me more about the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! My most favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Clouds OmniSlash couldn't be better. But I didn't want to completely spoil the show for you. You must see it for yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
