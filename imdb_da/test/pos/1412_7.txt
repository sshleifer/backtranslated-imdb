Johnny Crawford is amazing in this movie of a troubled teenager of a generation in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way honest flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene, but gives good and solid advice that applies today to morality, decisions, generation gap, teen dating (some of the statistics given in this movie are amazing. Today's statistics ). Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing. It's a great movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, although hair, fashion and language can change, people still struggle with the same problems they have been struggling with for thousands of years.
