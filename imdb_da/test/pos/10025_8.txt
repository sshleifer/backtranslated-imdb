Errol Flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historic bankruptcy of the famous (and some notorious) General Custer who follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and to the West to the Battle of The Little Big Horn, all offensive heads with rival Arthur Kennedy and romantic beautiful Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some may say that Flynn, who delivers a nice, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing Custer himself! <br /> <br /> A lavish production (which should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, they died with their boots on some really well-organized combat sequences. It is also a good experience to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> The previous year, Flynn Jeb Stuart played opposite Ronald Reagan's George Custer in the Santa Fe Trail (also with the Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail history class!
