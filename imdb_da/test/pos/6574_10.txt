Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a cruel car accident. She herself begins to live as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives. She has a girlfriend named Rahul (Anuj) and is getting married to him, but backs out because of the construction of her future mother-in-law and because of her boyfriend's lack of confidence. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And he starts making Roopa feel safe and secure. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD in AP's richest corporate house - has chosen to live as a neighbor to Roopa, and what follows. <br /> <br /> This movie has a freshness to what we rarely see in Indian movies for it. Although the story goes slow, you get a sense of it. Kudos to the director shekhar kammula for such a great direction! Brilliant music and background score composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has given a fantastic performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous looks and amazing histrionics. Anand like Raja has also done well. I've watched this movie three times now and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. It's a class except the daily dose of action movies we come here. Highly recommended !!
