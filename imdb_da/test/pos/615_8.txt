There is no dull moment in Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete". It is surprising how much is packed into this short film. While resting on a deserted beach after a naked swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking light for her cigarette. She invites him to love in a wooded area near the beach. Firewood returns to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She gives him a summer dress to cover her nudity and asks that he return the next day. He rides his bike back to the cabin dressed as a girl. His homosexuals are sexually excited. Early the next morning, the young man returns to the sea and bid farewell to the girl whose vacation is over. She suggests that he dress as a memento of their summer romance. It's a light hearted movie that captures the summer vacation by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.
