I had actually considered investing in this movie, as Gorman was drumming up with funding. I loved most of the script but didn't like the end. Gorman insisted the end was as it should be. <br /> <br /> See the finished movie I have to say I'm amazed. To read the manuscript, I had not imagined that the actor (and Gorman's instructor) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. The two leaders did a fantastic job. They were very trustworthy and this movie is worth seeing just for the performances of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for spoiler and if you haven't seen the movie, please read it no longer as you should see the movie first. (I would actually wish that I had never read the script so I could have experienced the movie ending first hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------------ - ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First, and I'm sure I mentioned this when I read the script, the wife should be dead. If she were dead, the end would be much more credible. As it is, we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him many years ago. "If she left him and he's still in love, he must be seriously misleading. But he doesn't get that way in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not use all this energy for wife he still loves.) <br /> <br /> And if the wife was dead, we could actually believe they had a fulfilling, reverent love and therefore believe that the guy is broken enough for the end to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> But I'm not buying Daphne what she does at the end. I would need a whole lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but trustworthy because of Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she made it out of some kind of love or something else, there's a whole piece of film / story missing. Much of this movie is reminiscent of "Sex, Lies, and Video tapes." I think it could have been so popular if Gorman had chosen to give the film a more credible ending. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And make your own mind.
