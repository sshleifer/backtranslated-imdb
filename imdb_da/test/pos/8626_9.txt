I grew up with Abbott and Costello movies, A. because my dad grew up with them, and both of our surnames are abbot so we owe deo a little respect, I didn't understand flack this movie and others of Theres get. It was a really classical reason, it was fun because abbot and costello were always the same characters, but it was so fun, now what I think of jack and beanstalk is, even though the love story is quite boring, and the song the Prince sings , round, awefull, but i like the angle they took on love, the story, the couple have to get married because a kingdom runs out of money, they meet in the prison cell and fall in love because they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being mated, so happy ends, I do not think it was the original version if it were they should have cut it out of this movie, but I think it was original and I love it . but see it suck, lol, even when the movie really goes into the giant + abbott and costello it's sooo fun. When the giant strikes the plug in the door and the jack screams "OPEN DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR" that things are really fun. And it once joke where jack begins to scream prince, prince and all the dogs jump him. a bit cheezy but really original. I wish they would have tried to remaster it, even though I got the African scream and the prayer counter, and I don't mind the quality cause when I had it on the tape, it was poor quality too so whatever I guess. The beginning is mildly fun, the middle is really great fun, and the end is not fun at least, but I'm 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh it hard, it's rock, this movie is real fun. I love their style. The chapters also suck. also the part where the jacket climbs the prayer template and they all sing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed, it's pretty funny
