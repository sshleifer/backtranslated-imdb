"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team that Naomi contacted before getting a knife in the back of Locke. But as the quote in my one-line summary says, their true purpose of being on the island can be quite different. All the new signs seem exciting (especially Miles, a kind of psychic / exorcist), but at this time it is still too early to make solid judgments. I felt that this episode was a small step down from the "Beginning of the End" (no flash-forward this time; short-term flashbacks instead), but it still has its amazing moments and picks up steam near the end. *** out of 4
