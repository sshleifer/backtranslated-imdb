Real stories do the best stories don't they? There is always something entertaining about a story, be it novel or movie or anything, just know it's right, make the story more fascinating. This movie is based on a true story of two young American men, a government employee and a falcon enthusiast? Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and the other? Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn)? Is a drug trade. These two begin selling the government, mostly CIA, secrets in 1975 to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character with ever-worsening drug abuse), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to America, no doubt would harm the film's credibility in the United States. Boyce is gradually becoming more cautious and ultimately frustrated and paranoid as their business moves, and they still dig deeper into treacherous territories. Daulton becomes more addicted and dependent on cocaine and heroin as he becomes more afraid, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he does not have control over, of which he is already having trouble with the law. The sausage of Boyce and Daulton's families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country, although considered fair, only causes major problems and the destruction of life? ? including the destruction of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and Penn each made extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel, so they are depicted with extensive depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The action is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The Paranoia atmosphere builds quite well. <br /> <br /> - History is fascinating, and of course, as one based on actual events, it has some extra kick. <br /> <br /> --Nice set. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets, working with Boyce and Daulton, render very good and not stereotypes or give vicious conscience just to make them look bad. <br /> Don't hurt it, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - The music is okay, nothing perfect though. <br /> <br /> - Sound effects are sometimes a little bad? Such was the case with many films from the seventies through the eighties. <br /> <br /> The bad: - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we hardly know. Because of Boyce's trouble brewing with the US and the Soviet regions, her life may be threatened, but it is not so extended as it feels that it should have been. Minor problem, though. <br /> <br /> The ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity required to sell state secrets is a little unpleasant. Nothing like a constant state of turmoil to keep the masses as uncertain as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - See the first CIA report that has been accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being "hardened". <br /> <br /> This was another movie that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of history. Studios and producers did not see how a film about two American traitors could ever be accepted by the American public. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, it helps with the treacherous anti-heroes not appearing heroically? More like a couple of young men who have made serious mistakes in the judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrays very well and very credibly. Trades: 9/10 History: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Camera: 8/10 Grade development: 9/10 Special effects / Makeup: 8/10 (small quantity, high quality) Emergency / Sexuality: 2/10 (a scene in a strip club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no one does, just some violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 8 / 10 <br /> <br /> If you like movies about espionage and spies, then you can't go wrong here. If you like dramatic movies with a strong focus on the character of the character, it can also work for you. Recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
