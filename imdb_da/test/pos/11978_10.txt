All the people who voted inferior 1 to this movie, that's all I have to say: You haven't matured enough to enjoy some kind of movie theater. Achieving that level of appreciation takes some degree of dedication. And that is the segment of people that this movie was aimed at. Not you average movie-goers by any chance! . Back to the movie. This was a gem okay and certainly an inclusion in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would give it an all time ranking of No. 2, only surpassed by Kanti Shah's legendary Gunda. This movie had an impeccable storyline and created a beautiful mix between fantasy and sci-fi. In fact, Pan's Labyrinth would have been ashamed of the balance between parallel stories. And now I really need to mention star cast and even stellar (it's a word from now) performances from them (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth). Each actor in this movie had been very carefully selected and the role was tailored to them (and in their age I must also add). Manisha Koirala still looks like she is 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have raped her too. Do you wonder where this rape came in suddenly? Yes, rape is what the premises in this movie are based on. And it's not like your average Bollywood-type movie. If you are an atheist or an agnostic at a chance, this movie is again a must for you. Because this movie can cure your faith. I don't think it would even be too long to say that this movie can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most fail to appreciate its power, charm, and underground beauty. Tchch, so unlucky! <br /> <br /> Only mistakes in this movie: In your dreams, baby! This was flawless. <br /> <br /> Only minor complaints: The director failed to steal Mithun Da as well. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin it for you any more. Just go see it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old Ramsay Brothers horror films, Loha, Indra tiger and Sivaji.
