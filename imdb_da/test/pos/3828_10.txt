I just thought I'd add another observation here. While there are a few visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unabashed emotions between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; There is a special, physical tender, moment, towards the end. When the company returns to the emergency chain speed in an attempt to fight a potentially deadly Romulan plasma bullet, Janice may fear that their lives are coming to a dramatic end, seeking comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the amazing instrument of their impending doom on the main. I thought it was sweet (and of course Janice is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times while allegedly firing the horrors, the film shows that photon torpedoes are being launched)
