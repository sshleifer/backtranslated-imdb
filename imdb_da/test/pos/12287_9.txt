I don't want to spoil the movie to anyone, but this mimics the reality of life in many ways, and if you are truly honest with yourself, you will resume it in accordance with at least a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> The play is not only credible but convincing in a way that hits one of the characters. Besides, it's fun without trying too hard on it. <br /> <br /> And yes, I really think a successor is justified here. Watch the movie, you understand why. <br /> <br /> Recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
