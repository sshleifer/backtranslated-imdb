I went to watch this movie on a book that signed in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful evening, it consisted of a few short words with Mr Bruce Campbell (you must say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while the books were signed and a QnA session with our favorite deadly killer lights dimmed. <br /> <br /> Not to spoil anything, I will not go into detail ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job of keeping the classic b-movie feel. The characters were classic "b" characters, the place was refreshing (what movies do you do * you know it's based in Bulgaria?) And the setting was both near-original and fun! In addition, the humor shared throughout the film that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie. <br /> <br /> While this movie does not have such a general appeal to people like some, a season of fun and laughter in a season (like Mr. Bruce Campbell puts it) is "b-movies" that is listed as 'a-movies' (Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and Chocolate Factory?!).
