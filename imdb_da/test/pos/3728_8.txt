I still can't describe what to feel when I received this on the fnac site. Such a rare movie, which is so little spoken and known, is hard to find, even to fans, but the contrast between past and present is devastating: Now I keep a DVD of the movie of the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the second rare Besson movie I bought over the Internet, I saw this at home, with all the lights on my DVD and TV turned off and amazed at the experience. I didn't know what to expect. I was always looking for some kind of disappointment when I saw a movie by Luc Besson I had never seen before. But it never came. This movie was no exception. From the start, I understood that the person who makes a movie like this as a first feature is destined to be great in the future. And then it happened. This won several prizes (including the highest prize at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud) and it shows that this film prepares many major things. This may be the most original post-war movie I have ever seen beating Mad Max in originality and artistic feelings. There is no problem with this movie: its movie is genius, as well as the actors' performance. I am also proud to say that I finally saw all of my favorite directors' movies and have a copy of almost all of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting to buy DVD). This film is first and foremost a style and commitment, making it clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent music use (I was also amazed by Eric Serra's first length) the promise of great performance. Gaumont did well to bet on his boy genius, the man who would later change the face of France and Europe's relationship between film and their audience. Let us hope that Besson starts working on a new director project. I want to be the first to cheer it. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn a lesson on how good movies are made with small money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, by its black and white filmography, suggests an even more depressed world view after the Holocaust. This film works from the film's pure magic: shows in pictures what we cannot explain with words. And I'm with all the people who wrote comments on this movie and liked it: good choice! A big hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a bit of their life was changed.
