I love so much about this movie: the music, the cinematography, the play, the story and all the Mormon clichés. Just because they are clichés, doesn't mean they aren't true! This is not perfect, it's a movie. Although excommunications are kept in well-lit rooms with beautiful large desks and chairs, it was perfectly appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this movie. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I mean, I think angels are waking up over us. What to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while they wait. I loved the irony because Mormons make such an agreement on smoking. I watched this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake and cried every time! It blows me away. And I've seen it 3 times in video now and it makes me cry every time. I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theater in Salt Lake will return it regularly to the General Conference as a cult movie (pun but not disregarded).
