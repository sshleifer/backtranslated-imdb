"Let me ask you another question" Ha! what a great soon .. this movie was brilliant amazing play, good script. The only reason no one noticed it was because of the low budget, everyone would agree that it is a cult like "Donnie Brasco", it shows a young Joe Pesci again as a mobster, this movie is up with their cults. it has some soprano and some goodfella's chase got its idea for the soprano when he saw this, and Scorsese found Joe Pesci while he looked at it, it shows that it should be good i am right or am i wrong? I have to admit that they showed a brilliant scene where they threw peanuts in a piano camp playing "Stop the Freckles".
