The hottest, most engaging movie in its genre, The Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work required to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are amazing and the story seems to write itself. A brilliant manuscript by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - See The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful set of movie footage (I think) at the actual summer theater where history takes place. You can't watch this movie and don't want to lose everything and get into the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
