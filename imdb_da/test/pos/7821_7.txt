I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I loved them together at Picket Hegn, so it was a good experience to see them together again. This was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes funny funny movies are just what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were beautiful and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when one fell apart. I knew it still tasted good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had left at Picket Fencing and I swelled as they kissed in this movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to see this again, but it was a big filler for one night.
