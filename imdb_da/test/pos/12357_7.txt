I thought it would be more amazing a story. But the subject is rather down to earth in relation to the story of the death that I expected. In fact, there is much more of a social drama. As usual in "European author's movies". <br /> <br /> Actors are interesting, not overactive as in the average quiet movie. Pictures are not so good that they are stuck in your mind as in Bergmans Smultronsted. <br /> <br /> It is true that the comparison between the two films is the most important point here. The crumbling place begins with a vision of a dead car, where Sjöström's character can see his own body. There are watches without hands. He's forced to look back at what he's done wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen Sjöström's wife does not cheat him, but she wants to escape with the little children, because it will never get better with him. Finally, Edit's confession is a form of living judgment. I just want to add that Sjöström was destroying the door with an ax because his wife locked it and plan to walk away with the kids reminding me of The Shining. It was much more of a fantasy story with death hanging around.
