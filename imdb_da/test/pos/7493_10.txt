This movie is hard to beat. It follows in the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but still succeeds by stamping its own unique style. Cast is amazing, the script is amazing - and things like the odd (Pulp Fiction-esque) time sequencing are done brilliantly. I especially like how the flashback images vary dramatically depending on who tells the story at that time. When it is one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero's memories, everything is skanky and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie - and therefore I am extremely annoyed to find out I can't buy it anywhere!
