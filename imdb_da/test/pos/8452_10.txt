I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when it was first released, and each time I've seen it. The political drama is effective if not very new or inspired. The decades since the release of the film has shown that the willingness to reduce the cost at the expense of public security is certainly not just something imagined by a writer. <br /> <br /> But I think the most impressive feature of this movie is Jack Lemmon's performance. It is amazing to see him at work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, Jack's face checks out when he doesn't say anything. He does not have to speak (or worse yet, to mugs) to tell you what goes through his mind. I call this a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when I first saw the movie: in Lemmon's last scene in the movie, as he lies on the floor, he feels a little vibration. Terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images I've seen in any movie. It seems perfect because it immediately transmits the threat of occurrence - if Jack's character is so frightened, there is certainly something terrible to happen. And it does.
