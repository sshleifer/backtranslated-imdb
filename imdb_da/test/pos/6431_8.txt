It must be so difficult to tell a story where much is not happening but still seize the viewers' attention. I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. Rutger has a great voice that is very calming, clever and dangerous (I'm not gay) it is reminiscent of the qualities that Robert Redford has told. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry has left, will he be lonely and will he say goodbye? Also one gets annoyed at Mr Hauer's failure to get involved in more work of this caliber. Let's hope he continues to do fine work in the Netherlands and stays away from Hollywood. Worth seeing
