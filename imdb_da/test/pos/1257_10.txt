From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this is definitely worth it. This is the second Bruce Willis movie in a row that manages to tell his story without nudity, off-humor humor, profanity or free violence. (Of course I refer to The Sixth Sense.) Both films are involved in more than one level. This one is also suitable for children, but as others have pointed out, it is not a flick for children. <br /> <br /> I was bothered that the time travel device driving this plot is never explained except that we know that Russell himself initiates it as a 70-year-old. Also, why should his dying mother come to school to get him when he wins the fight; Why, if his elder says himself to fight that child over and over again for the next few years, the mother must not come and get him every time and why he does not learn to kick ass in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate for the action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plan as a metaphor, however.
