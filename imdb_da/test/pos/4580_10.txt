I stumbled upon this movie by accident. I mean, how could I find out? It was not hyped at all by the studios, nor did I even hear if it was release from my normally-connected friends. Having thrown my money away on so many bad movies this year, I wish I could have seen this in theaters as opposed to DVD. Mike Judge is the gentleman to indulge in delicious intelligent humor in a small brow pack. Just see "King of the Hill" for a while ... apparently it's redneck humor, but it's a very subtle jab on rednecks while at the same time being very sympathetic. I read the tagline for this movie and immediately I ordered it from the internet. I really don't understand where those negative reviews come from, except perhaps from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, but it is also balanced. Levity's moments are distinguished between hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstar / corporate culture. Sure there is some fat humor, but it is only there to laugh at the tip. The principle is only half likely, but since when was it even something? I can't see people chopping on "Futurama" because the premise is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you don't laugh, then something is really wrong with you. Maybe your father works for Gatorade or something and he was really offended by the movie. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the latter.
