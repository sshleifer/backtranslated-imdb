I just finished watching Marigold today and I start by saying that I found this DVD on the Blockbuster shelves. As I walked around looking for something new and good to see, the picture of Ali Larter took my attention. After driving over Ali Larter I picked up the cover and continued to look at the cover. From the look of it, I thought the costumes were a little over the top. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and figured that it was a kind of ghost film or something like that. <br /> <br /> As I skipped the synopsis section and saw Salman Khan, I took a double take. Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter in a DVD on Blockbuster? Because Salman Khan is that Bollywood movie like Mel Gibson is for Hollywood movies, I had very high expectations for this movie: it should be good! I'm very happy to say that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It goes way beyond all my personal expectations! I suppose a movie like this is what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal-oriented instructor, two incredible actors starring and just a very hardworking support and crew! Khan and Larter seem to have really good chemistry together and both are shining on the big screen: They look really good together. The musical numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising considering how the musicals of the Osteic and long Indian movies are these days. And you'll be glad to know that the Indian costumes are very far from being cheesy as you get. The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the middle was really good, the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic, but the ending was just amazing! However, I have a few grips and complaints about the DVD. While I loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the DVD, I didn't like the fact that several other things were left by the DVD. At first, there is no subtitle. Since English is my first language, it is no problem. But when some of the Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; captioning would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on the DVD would be a blooper reel or some sort of outtakes collection. And finally, what about a menu option that would allow us to jump to the right of the songs? Man, some of these songs were really good! On the front page I enjoyed seeing Marigold's presentation. <br /> <br /> I have tons more to say about the movies awesomeness and how much I liked it, but I don't have the time I would like to continue writing why I enjoyed it so much. I hope Salman Khan will make several English films beyond his Hindi movie, and I certainly hope that this Hindu movie will not be Ali Larter's last Bollywood movie. And I urge the director to continue making Bollywood movie hybrids with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other big name actors - just make sure scripts are original and good. 10/10 - this is just a great love story movie that your whole family can enjoy!
