When Les Amants Reguliers immediately calls for comparison with Bertolucci's film The Dreamers, in my opinion, the best film about the 1968 revolt made students in Paris. Indeed, director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague, to share the lead and even with a direct reply in the face of an older movie by Bertolucci. And yet LAR is another movie and an interesting one. <br /> <br /> History also seems to be known. The movie starts with long scenes of 1968 'emeutes', perhaps among the best finishes so far. The film is made in black and white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian apartment where the heroes of the defeated rebellion make art, smoke substances, dreams and fall to each other. There are no direct social comments, no real explanation for the rebels' background. The film focuses on the character's psychology and on the love story between the protagonists. It is like a prior transition process to the establishment that the generation of 1968 went through, just that not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The movie is more about the characters than about the events. And it is only for the style it is remembered about. The black and white cinema is memorable not only in the scenes of the revolution, but also when looking at the character revolution. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique derived from the silent movie films, with long hours accompanied by an off-piano tune. The effect is exquisite. But the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours, and I doubt that it has only been missed to cut it for only two hours - in fact, I am convinced that it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without raising the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's film LAR, another perspective is to remember one of the more important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
