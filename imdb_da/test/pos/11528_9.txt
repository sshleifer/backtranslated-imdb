In one way or another, you can't get away from the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are mentally or emotionally sensitive leave. They leave a hole in the back of life for those who love them. A hole seen in its finality as selfish. That's what Phoebe finally realizes. Just ahead to help Wolf heal from his self-esteem. She can accept closure to the missing ... of her sister. Beautiful European scenery. A lot of truth in it about idealism and dependence on the next big moment. For a moment I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff band that was around the early 70s. I liked this movie as it reflected a time when I was old myself.
