I am the first to acknowledge that Chan-wook Park's thirst is exceptionally well done, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo (OK wine Kim) is enough for someone to tolerate for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wants to volunteer for experimental studies on those who are willing to submit to severe injections for a particular virus that kills infectively. Instead of legally dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire who always longs for the nourishment that blood gives him to fight a contagious disease that returns and causes the symptoms that flattened him to begin with (.. bumps / wounds and the body throws up blood). Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torture death if exposed to Hyeon for a long time. Hyeon falls in love with Tae-joo, wife of the infamous childhood woman Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was taken by Mrs Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy and practically used as a pet to be ordered around. Ta-joo is unhappy in this situation and begins a horrible affair she invokes with Hyeon, soon manipulating him to perhaps kill Kang-woo by making him believe she is a victim of abuse. Abandoning His Priesthood, Hyeon dives his head into the relationship with Tae-joo, soon a willing participant to kill Kang-woo. This incident, which Tae-woo contributed (... using a boat in the middle of a lake, both continued to bury him underwater, Tae-woo kept him Kang-woo from refilling when he tried to re-enter ) will haunt both as circumstances arise with Kang-woo "missing" (Hyeon let go of him where the police would not find his body). Soon, Mrs Ra suffers a stroke (though a finger and the ability to blink his eyes contribute greatly as the story progresses and shows that she is more conscious than they have made her believe), and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday present ..vampirism. Hyeon has thereby created a monster. Tae-joo admits (though a heavy tongue) that Kang-woo does not actually hurt her, and when she craves blood, it is soon realized that killing a supply does not disturb her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a hand full, Hyeon must take desperate action if he is to stop such a threat to society, even with. <br /> <br /> I would say that thirst is one of the best horror movies I have seen compared to 2009. It's a methodical approach, Park takes, and we are headed down on a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo, when they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love (... what was once an obsessive love at the end) for Tae-joo, and it will end if he doesn't make a painful choice. We see within their heads, their souls, and it is not always beautiful. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting. But the honor of the director to draw no blows to incredible behavior and how vampirism's powers can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo, so you could look at Thirst as a unique love story, but not exactly a healthy one. The violence, while the park tends to pull away from extremely graphic details, there is probably sadism involved in perhaps turning the stomach a little. At least, the way the violence is carried out can be sure to leave a lasting impact. The sexual relations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite heated and erotic, while also being black and morally reprehensible. The film I believe is still quite a complex study of the lengths you will remain attached to an object of love (desire).
