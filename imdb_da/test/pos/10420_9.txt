The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods with a place in the city. This hilarious farce, I think, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami pokes fun in the New York community by creating the trustworthy, eccentric and tragic characters of a rental apartment complex that brings them to life from the very open a shot that introduces them. Peter Stormer's performance as a gay Shakespeare actor is absolutely commendable and the film generally does a great job of showing hopelessness and ridiculous self-centered ambition. Sandra Bernhard is perfectly cast as the right, self-imposed therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance tremendously, especially since I haven't been a very big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiot criminals who could not plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a como look by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the revolutionary mommy's boy enjoys a place in the city without missing a blow.
