Such a great movie - I was transfixed all the time and so emotionally overcome in the end! The two young male actors in the film were more than convincing in their performance, as their friendship and support from each other were completely credible, and I thought the comparison / contrast between their respective home life and health situations was made so much real between them. The success of bringing this movie to life was of course a team effort, so for actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors and the whole production, I say, "WELL PLAY!" After missing out on the credits at the start of the movie (it was shown on HBO) I was so surprised that I really had to investigate (albeit briefly) the internet to find the title of this movie - something so good should have been known of me - a clear indication that this film should be republished!
