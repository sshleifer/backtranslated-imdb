... "Inglorious" as our local theater decided to show his title to their marquee, minus the second word. It's a great movie theater. <br /> <br /> I don't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone but the over-squeamish. Never let them know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I was hesitant to give it ten stars because of my experience with Tarantino's previous films. In any case, you need to save "Reservoir Dogs", they are enhanced with additional watching. <br /> <br /> So even though I gave it ten stars, I reluctantly did it. It does not leave me "up" to go to. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi, we all thought the worst was. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat, and who spreads his cigarette suddenly in a strudel and grinds it in whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's movies, you only need a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary, and when needed, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse in the opening scene, they are muffled and dark, but too much. Outside there is a glorious sun, but in one room in the house everything is bathed in shadows and black. It is a glorious approach to an interrogation by Waltz, as "Jew Hunter" of the SS, dangling his host's French farmer over the precipice to reveal what he cannot reveal many times, pulling him back with unhappy lines of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> Another sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl later acts as an important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz .... almost. <br /> <br /> Movie classes will study a lot from this movie. They should look lovingly at the amazing pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw a scene, build excitement on Hitchcock's way, so at the straight break, suddenly come to a decision. <br /> <br /> For color, look for a last shot at a French theater, where its secret Jewish proprietor creates a surprise for the Nazi leader's supreme reach. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, in anticipation of the hated German dignitaries, who will come up with a preview of the latest Deutsch movie masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious performances. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the mirrored theatrical glass mirrors, her red lips and low dress reflecting the intensity of her designs throughout her guests. It's a single shot that would be worth a whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are fortunately many more such images, many more paced scenes with exquisite dialogue and excitement. In short, see it. I'm sure you will see it again and again.
