A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The recording technique is very unpleasant - very old-fashioned BBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes unpleasant feeling of realism to the whole piece. <br /> <br /> The actors are extremely well-chosen - Michael Sheen not only has "all of the Polaris" but he also has all the votes down! You can really see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries. It is not only worth seeing, but it is a fantastic written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. Realism really comes home with the little things: The guards' fantasy, which instead of using the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays to our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes around Orton and Halliwell, and the sets (especially their surface with the Halliwell murals decorating each surface) are terribly well done.
