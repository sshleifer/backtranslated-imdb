This movie is titled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Go figure! The movie is a pleasure for both the audience and adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this movie through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps tired and melodramatic; while the narrative may seem new and creative to young people who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line. In any case, credit should be given to the film's creators, especially director James Becket and filmmaker Denis Maloney, to make this most entertaining and visually interesting movie. The intersections of the young protagonist Ricky's fantasy thoughts are fun and pleasantly filmed. The young actors provide consistent credible performances, apparently rightly invested in their roles - silly as many scenes are. Jordan Garrett plays the main character "Ricky" with pretty good, with excellent camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a lovely soft and sensitive "Shashi" that thrives on hot sauce from all the ridiculous things. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also provide solid performances. <br /> <br /> As is typical of his always fine acting, Larry Miller creates a solid parenting figure where the children's part-real, part-fantasy world is about. Compared to his father figure, the other great adult roles seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, intentional and quite humorous, so to be sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simplified youth-targeted story of course, but it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly, to the targeted youth, but also to at least one view of adults who retain the ability to see such a films from their disposable perspective.
