A lucky trick. I thought I was at a bad start, bringing home the wrong DVD in the case of "The Intruder". Rental shops staff! So I didn't want to watch this movie, but I'm happy about that. In all possible cases, my chosen movie would not have been as amazing a record film as this delightful and delicate taste of what independent in the US and Europe can do together. Seven years apart, two heroine sisters go through amazing travels through the early 1970s post-student demo / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuous shot in the Algarve, Portugal; And in Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feelings of the outer shootings of Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece, "The Fourth Man"), it has been meticulously traded by Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone. The story reveals itself along an abstract plot, capturing the noble feelings of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealized images of each other and split themselves. A movie with great refinement and taste. Not for Arnie Commando fans, which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in his 'claim' this is a great movie. Daft criteria. Wrong too. Worth experimenting with.
