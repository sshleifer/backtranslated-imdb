Thirty years after the 1939 classic film, Robert Donat won an Oscar and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a host of problems before they hit the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who again got heave-ho in favor of - fortunately - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Other Previns scores were rejected and once used was composed by - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. First-time director Herbert Ross was entrusted with the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - a man for both his wife and students - into a great budget extravaganza. The fact that it succeeds as well as it does in spite of the many obstacles in the way is a testament to its two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boy school in suburban England where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially unlucky, he is dedicated to his students, but unable to inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student takes him to a London music hall to watch an entertainment starring Katharine Bridges, the young lady he hopes to marry. The aftermath is inappropriate for everyone, and Chips - which he is commonly known - go out to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. Unexpectedly, he drives into Katharine, who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to allow her time to provide a failed love affair and contemplate the direction of her career. At the time they spend together, she discovers a friendly and gentle man under the deepened exterior, and when he returns to London, he is seriously pursued. When the fall season begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two embark on a life of quiet homeland. Complications occur when aspects of Katharine's surface, and again when the Second World War penetrates into their lives, but Chips is bolstered by his wife's support, and his new-found confidence makes him a favorite among students. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few musical interludes - the delightful music hall's production number "London is London" and Katharin's love statement, "You and I" - most of Bricusse's songs, some of them appeared in voice-over as the characters explores their feelings, is easily forgettable and in no way enhances the movie. Eliminate the score altogether, and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" seems pretty good as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original while expanding and updating with a few decades. He has made several scenes between Chips and Katharine, which beautifully delineate their devotion to each other and infused some with comic relief with the kindness of Katharine's friend and cohort, the top actor Ursula Mossbank (beautifully played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's real-life wife at that time). He also captures the life of a British primary school, which corresponds to a private academy here in the States, with infinite perfection. Ross does well as a first-time instructor who sprinkles the movie with breathtaking photography moments - the opening circuit sequence, where the school's anthem echoes in the school's grand rocks, sets the tone for the film. Costumes and sets are true to the period. The students portrayed by non-professionals enrolled at the school, used as Brookfield, handle their various small supportive roles well. Highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. O'Toole was long established as a first-rate dramatic actor, so his Oscar-nominated performance here comes as no surprise. Clark, a veteran of two dozen B movies in the UK and the previous year's "Finian's Rainbow", is brilliant as the music hall's soubrette, which continues a theatrical career in favor of life as the school's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost gives us the opportunity to overlook how most of them are unimaginable, and she more than matches O'Toole in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us without a doubt that this is a couple of very in love. This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not classical as its predecessor, but hardly the disaster described many critics as it was released. Ignore the score, concentrate on the show and experience the atmosphere Ross has put on the screen. It's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
