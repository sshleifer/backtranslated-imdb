Oh God ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the world's most exciting and important people, especially of my culture. She is incredibly inspiring, and her story is the story of a great woman! When I first chose this movie, I thought that the casting was wonderfully composed so we could see them in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I think she is the greatest of all times. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and reached Kleenex while reminding me that wherever you come from, if you decide to be good, then you will be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why the Caged Bird sings."
