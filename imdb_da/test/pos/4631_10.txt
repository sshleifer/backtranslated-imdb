I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is fun and chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is not a dull moment in the movie, and Debbie looks beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story is about a showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) who meets an infertile soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). She receives him immediately, but after he accidentally knocks his dress back, he returns it to her, provided she goes on a date with him. They end up getting married the night of their date after just one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so Maggie suggests that they live for a month but not as husband and wife, which means Joe can't kiss or sleep with Maggie, much to Joe's frustration. A fun plot and a wonderful movie. Not to be missed.
