I thought this was a very bold representation of the old hokey 'Tarzan' concept that was made so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller, et al. Yes; There are many stupid things. But then the idea is stupid. It's almost incredible that a human baby could be born into adulthood by chimpanzees. I am tempted to say absolutely incredible, but the concept has never been tried. And there's probably a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Even under the circumstances, I can see how it would be very difficult to avoid. We also now have a much greater insight into the topics of acculturation and know that a human being raised from childhood without human behavioral concerns would ultimately never teach them in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Still, if you can get your head around this lot, there is a lot to admire that is both imaginative and bold. Lambert does the game with huge aplomb. I am tempted to say that it is the most compelling and sympathetic role I have seen him play. There are also plenty of other great performances. Not least of these are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly worrying - and rightly so - is the same view of people. We get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, stupid and helpless brethren, over whom we routinely saw gentlemen. And it shows well how the false 'civilization' and 'morality' that we cover and justify our behavior is merely an expression of selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a little exaggerated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; It is a truth about the way we are today. It is one that needs to be specified and cannot be specified often enough. Holms character's obsession with "ray-zor" as a symptom of civilization - as if possessing facial hair was a primitive condition for being despised - is an excellent case. Primitive bearded readers note. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. In the end, it's a tragedy. Because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom of moral tyranny, which is truly human 'civilization'; We know he is doomed. Before the third millennium is 50 years, wild simians will be hunted for extinction as shrubs and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to satisfy insatiable human profits. In the end, it's a story about ourselves. The path to extinction that other simians step on must gradually be followed by humans. Recommended for its ethical roof despite the hokey moment.
