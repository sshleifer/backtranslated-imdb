Little Dieter Need to fly was my first film in the 1999 edition at the Gothenburg Film Festival. When I was very tired that night, I was hesitant to see it, but the overall score of 9 here at IMDB made me go there. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of pure vitality! Discovering Dieter Dengler's life through his own story was enchanting. <br /> <br /> SEE IT! And if possible ... watch it at a movie theater!
