I have never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I must say that the new show works very well. It's fun (it should also say "Comedy" in the genre description, many plot changes are only acceptable because of their comic value), it's well-written and it makes a poor budget a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are too easy to turn up (with time travel, rescue of his dead parents and such things) seem incredibly good here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to see as the Witty and Light-hearted but Occasionally Morose Doctor - if they can find a good substitute for him, I am totally surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. However, there is no doubt that the Eccleston episodes go down in history as classics. The relationship between Doctor and Rose is especially refreshing. Doc is far more of a father figure than a romantic interest, and yet there is a tip about romantic induendo between them, which, however, is much more emotional and human than sexual. A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this should have better special effects. And why don't they just use some cheaper effects, I don't know. In this day and age, SFX doesn't have to cost a bundle - just look at Star Wars: Revelation's fan movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
