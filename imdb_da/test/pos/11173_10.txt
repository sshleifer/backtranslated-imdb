By now, the game is outdated, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes have been made. It's all over. After all, the creative genius that ran this game for the first two games was gone. <br /> <br /> Incorrect. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are here, people. Sure, they're all rehash, but it was also Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the easy light 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. The ship Huge sub-games are poorly inappropriate, in the tradition of underplay. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for your membership card for an exclusive beach, always select "You don't need to see my identification." It's worth the price of the game alone.
