I provided location services on this movie every Sunday we wanted to shoot in London's Berkeley Square. David Niven ever gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role, unfortunately being his last. we had a moment of panic when a trunk of fake Krugerrands (thrown to the movie ..) tipped down a storm drain. <br /> <br /> Imagine that hectic crew opens all the drains to restore every one. If you know and love London, you'll love this comedy wheel - Richard Jordan also starts, which unfortunately died of a brain tumor. A great movie, fantastic crew, fantastic cast. Look for current stars of coronation street then play crowd scenes or extras. The car party and Ivan's retail businesses were all shot in western London, Chiswick's entire shopping parade and the American used car lot were dressed overnight, the car lot is still there as are the shops. A restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral home. If you see the movie on the list, make an effort to see it! That way, Sally Harrison's bank receptionist was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 Just thought I'd add a few extra comments in places: Pub: right next to Berkeley Square Every Summer Cottage: Back Road along Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Lot: along Chiswick High Street and All shops near roundabout. Workshops (conversion of armored vehicles) Factory at roundabout opposite Fullers Brewery Prison (see workshops above) Telephone box see Elke Sommers cabin (it was the wooden study prop box that was used in many films, look for light cable on gound level and the tree hinges on the door! !! Computer room Honeywells near Olympia Graveyard - Chiswick - Tombs just outside the border of common ground Bank interiors, ceilings and strongroom: Twickenham studios <br /> <br /> Just to add David Niven ever gentleman, joked and mixed with the crew extras and so on ...... Niven would eat in the Connaught hotel bu join the crew for coffee!
