Michael Jackson's album hit the tables, John Landis still had a lot of good will built up by his genre pic "An American werewolf in London" (not to mention his classic comedies Dyrehus and BLUES BROTHERS) and choreographer Michael Peters were creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos during that period. <br /> <br /> Not sooner or later, a single piece of film has illuminated, exploited, or emphasized MJ's incredible talent or the more "other" aspects of his persona are just like THRILLER, the world's most successful (if not officially the first) long-form video, and the most fondly remembered. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and all the talents behind the creation and execution are up there on the screen. And how would it not be completely without "rap" from the original song provided by the late, big Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills already there? <br /> <br /> The times of honesty of one of the world's greatest artists have long since gone, but no one can ever take away the man's towering achievements, of which this is probably the most memorable.
