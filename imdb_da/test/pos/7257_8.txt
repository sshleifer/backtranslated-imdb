I tend to like historical (period) movies and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended this to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor so I figured it was worth it and I was totally rewarded !! His depiction as a member of the English noble class was far more accurate than I have seen before. The comedy aspect of it left my pages hurt, the costumes were not terrible, and historically I didn't go too much. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewage system until much later, but anyone who dosages does not go deep into England's past, will not notice or care. Definitely worth a look. I highly recommend this movie.
