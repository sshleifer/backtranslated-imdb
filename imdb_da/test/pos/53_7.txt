This movie was very good, not great, but very good. It is based on a man's game by Ruben Santiago Hudson .. he played most of the parts. On paper it looks like stunt molding. Yes, let's round off all the black people in Hollywood and put them in a movie. Halle Berry produced it herself. The only name I didn't see was Oprah's, thank goodness, because it would probably end up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead, this movie was not a sentimental mess. It was moving, but not fake, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and that writer. The film was about the universe of Nanny, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she traveled the author and took people in. Now he is a newborn New Yorker when he said she took sick people and old and then we see them go to a mental institution to pick up a man, I think sister has a medicare scam going on. Get People's Jobs and Take Medicare / Caid Checks But no she explains Lou Gosset, she just wants 25 bucks a week and didn't want the money in advance. I think that part was put in the movie, just for us who were enchanted by New Yorkers, so we know she doesn't scamming the poor people. (G) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal (g). She seems almost English and looks through small boys eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne'er doing well, who is 17 years younger and fools around her. Terrence Howard was born to play these types of parts. He was good, but I want to see him play something different. Markerson, who plays Nanny, is also very good. But for some reason, the person standing out for me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where's this man's Oscar? He already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in the axle and he stole the movie. I didn't even know who he was in this movie. He's never a chameleon. I have never seen him play a bad role yet. This was a 5 minute role, and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I re-winded the scene sometimes ... sometime because I didn't know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I've seen her in roles before most mousy things. But she's so good here. I actually know people who work just like her. So it was very true for me, Macy Gray, who had one of the larger parts, was also very good. I was very glad they didn't kill Nanny. I thought she was a goner at the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we might know or even lived with. Thank God for them, I don't know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who has lost 2 children and gone through a lot of things, but when I feel selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This movie is a tribute to all these people. I only wish they told us what happened to some of the characters as one armed man, Pauline's boyfriend, played by one of my favorite actors on HBO's The Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez's character and Richard, the lesbians and Delroy Lindos one arm man, he was fascinating in another small role.
