I totally agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of the best of Christie adaptations with a superlative plot and cast. <br /> <br /> The scene involving Liz Fraser as the mother of murder victims is a study of acting at the finest level. This underrated woman was a fave in the Brit movie in the 1960s, which never got a mainstream break in American movies. Check her out as Julie Andrew's friend in 1964 AMERICANIZATION OF THE EMILY. <br /> <br /> All the peripheries of this prod have a chance to shine with and without the relentless Ms. Hickson never got nommed for an Emmy for her Marple work. Shame on them! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
