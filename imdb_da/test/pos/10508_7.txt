It would be so easy to dismiss a foreign filtering movie before you even see it - as I did - but it is good to look at. If you think about it, it is not an easy issue to handle, but this film manages to suspend infidels, which in themselves are an experience for such a subject. Casting the protagonist as a doctor was a sensible feature that gives credence to his will to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. Vosloo plays it very sensitively with us in his pain and confusion at the strange events taking place himself and his wife. Special effects are used sparingly, but for shocking effects, and sometimes the film is quite gripping, but unfortunately there are a few points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. After completing the construction of a tense climax, the end is somewhat of a disappointment. The supporting signs were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or threatening (the psychiatrist) who also served to impair. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, it raised some interesting topics, among which were a storyline "How do animals feel when we experiment on them?" <br /> <br /> The term "lost time" became also thought provoking.
