I think this movie is underestimated. For me it felt like a fresh air. Some people complain about the plot's unreasonability, long-lasting sequences and lack of sex (the latter is, in my opinion, the main reason for "impossibility" and how come no drunken teenagers to talk dirty? But it's just not their thing, and good for them, if they can't relate to the story. The performance is great; I really want to see more of the actors in other movies. The feelings are genuine. The whole pristine love thing is presented with eerie subtlety. And it gives you the tingly feeling you expect to come from a good movie.
