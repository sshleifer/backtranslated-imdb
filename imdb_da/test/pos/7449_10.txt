What is there to say about this movie? This movie is simply beautiful. A real feast for the eyes. Just as the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen trailers and the amazing details of each frame and let me tell you that this movie does not disappoint. You can actually see the fibers in Clouds sweater vest. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The movie features several rearranged tracks from the video game, which fans will surely recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest weakness is its history. It's not exactly a bad story, but this story is aimed only at people who have played video games. Firstly, viewers may feel lost at times, or they may not feel the importance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you've never played the game, because what we have here is a special movie. Watch it and enjoy the beautiful show.
