Acts of course! Think of it, Closet Land could easily have become so terrible - a whole movie filmed in a room with only two people, they have better some damn interesting things to talk about. <br /> <br /> But that didn't make it terrible. On the contrary, thanks to incredible depictions of both Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in itself. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it's for everyone. People who have had their attention ranges dropped through sparkling sex scenes and random gun fire may have trouble digesting Closet Land. But those who can appreciate good storytelling without explosions should give it a look (no matter how many video stores you need to call to find someone in stock).
