The first time I saw Satan's brotherhood, I was 12 years old, I saw it in a small town in central Washington. It played before Tales from the crypt, which we left early because my sisters were already afraid of Satan's brotherhood. All in all, I thought it was a really good movie. The beginning was good, we had just sat down and the tank made a number on the station wagon. What struck me about the movie was the nature around the city where it was filmed, it almost looked like an area around Chelan WA where I watched the movie, especially when they drove towards the town of Hillsboro, which is the location of the movie a small town in SW New Mexico . I always wanted LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman, who was on Get Smart another show I like. I gave the movie a 7 and later when I got to see Tales from the crypt, I thought the brotherhood of Satan was better.
