This small picture succeeds how many a large image fails. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not harassed by the study of large wigs. He was happier with this movie than anyone else because he was able to do it his way. He could also use his repertoire of gifted character actors who had played such an important role in his previous successes. Some of those like Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and had the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. Years later, he would win the coveted Oscar for his amazing performance in The Last Picture Show. Ward Bond even casts out Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the master of the car, this role is played by Johnson, but because of this film he was later given the role of coach driver in the classic TV series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the Wagon Master's bad guys, James Arness, would be in the hit TV series "Gunsmoke" on a rival network of "Wagon Train." Ward Bond plays the head of the Mormon head west, which often falls back to his sinful days by cussing only to be called down by other Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When a nuisance situation arises, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) says, "Blow your horn, sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon's sister played to perfection of Jane Darwell, then blows so loud and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of John Steinbeck's novel "The Wrath's Grapes." Another of the great character actors in Ford's company was Hank Worden, who plays one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's infamous but not too bright forbidden sons. The word would be famous a few years later to play Moses in Ford's "The Searchers." The word lived to be 91. He still made movies when he died. Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse traders who never take their jobs seriously, have a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They are mixed up with a Mormon wagon train route west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the movie. The main reason for teaming is a red-haired Mormon beauty progression Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley) who catches Sandy's eye. Along the way, the train captures a hoochie coochie show that includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). Also joining along is the Clegg family, the desire for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult a journey west by wagon was these days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the movie were written by Stan Jones from the legendary sons of the Pioneers. Jones' writing was almost as good as Bob Nolan, who had previously made much of the writing to the group. Jones' most famous song, not in this movie, is the very busy "Ghost Riders In The Sky." Pioneer's sons do the background in the "Wagon Master". This attributes the overall effect of wagons rolling west. It should also be noted that the renowned Indian, Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma, plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last movie look. He did not die long after the "Wagon Master" was released.
