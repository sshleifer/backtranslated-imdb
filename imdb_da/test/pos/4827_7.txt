May contain Spoilers !!! In no way, form or form does this film break the scary movie mold. Not by a long shot. But it delivers a spooky atmosphere, credible enough characters and doings. The story is simple and does not interfere with transforming itself more than it should. A bunch of children are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900s. Since then, they have stalked and killed the stay of their sleepy little PA town in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: They want revenge on the man who caused their death many years ago. Of course, his big, big, grandson is in town, and he's a real dot. Along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit a driven old house after the man dies. The oldest daughter is rebellious, unpleasant ... a typical teenager. The younger is curious, bright eyes and enters the ghost children. The faintest part of this flick is the child's pure numbness, and they chop their way through the victim after sacrifice. Excellent play. It was so scary! I think the kids in the corn girls are one thing ... but this topped some of them (as for the scary kids). <br /> <br /> Be aware of a look. I bought it before I saw it and I wasn't dissatisfied. But I'm a horror fan through and through.
