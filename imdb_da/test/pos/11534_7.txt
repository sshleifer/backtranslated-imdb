So it's not an epic, but for people who experience something similar <br /> <br /> (sibling suicide) it can be an interesting way of therapy. One <br /> <br /> imaginative tale and some great actors make it early <br /> <br /> used. For some reason it's not really caught up in the audience, <br /> <br /> something I think is a result of the main theme. Why did she <br /> <br /> commit suicide? It is clear that this is not something that American <br /> <br /> film owners will flock to if it were a European production it would probably have reached the audience in a much larger <br /> <br /> scope . However, it is a movie that, although the realism is contaminated by a <br /> <br /> shining romantic glow, gives the viewer a whole heart impression.
