This movie had some very fun moments. The aforementioned feeb sketch for starters. <br /> <br /> The parts where Rik tries to act worthily in front of his guests and look down on them through his nose. Very subtly done, especially since the guest was a toffee nosed arrogance himself. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rik finds out that Gina has a fiance, "Ahhh. She tightened me all the way." with its 2 light eyes. Like she really fancied him. But he believed it. That's why it was so much fun. Great moment. <br /> <br /> Gino was also excellent. He should have been used more like the bad man. "Where are the horns I ordered!" he bellows. Brilliant things.
