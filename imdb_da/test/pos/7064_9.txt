Meatballs have been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and has seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and turns to him as he heads his CIT once in a hurry after another! The play is fun and fun, and you really care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy, stupid, teen sex party. It's fun and sweet and just about all fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must-see. Beware of Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the camp socially - while Bill Murray pushes it up for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he chooses to dance with!) Far one of my most favorite comedies all the time!
