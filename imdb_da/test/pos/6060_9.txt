Jack Webb is riveting as a Marine Corp drill instructor in D.I .. Webb play Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose work it is to prepare young teens for possible combat. No one could have played this role any better, Jack Webb. As a former port, I can assure myself that this is the most accurate movie dealing with basic training in Corp. Extremely entertaining!
