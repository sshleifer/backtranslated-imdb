It's fun to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the cheapskate Weight and Measures guy who takes his job very seriously and joins the toes of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered the world but keeps his integrity. He's beaten up and set up, but that's the problem. We never know if he's really in danger. They say he's in a spot, but still seems to have carte blanche moving around and doing what he has to do. At times he is so furious that he doesn't do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department, but almost everything else is pretty corrupt. He continues (almost too good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. The problem for me is the lack of sustained tension. It would have been much better if he had deleted his name. He never falls into the depths even when rejected by his wife to be. It's still fun with the bad bones See it just to see Cagney make his tough guy out.
