I'm not quite sure why I ordered "Fingersmith" from Netflix - probably because I enjoy BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was seeing. The reason, which I will only describe in general not to spoil it to anyone who wants to see it after reading my review, has more twists than a mountain road in the Rockies, the kind that usually appears in "caper" movies. They are very unusual for a period of drama. Not having read the novel (and I do not intend to do that), I was completely unprepared for the surprise ending the first segment of the DVD and just surprised by the subsequent twists. Nevertheless, it is extremely well-acted by the two young directors (especially Sally Hawkins, such as Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud) and in key supporting roles of Imelda Staunton as the mother figure in a theft and by Charles Dance as the rich uncle collecting pornographic materials that save young Maud from the crazy house, where her mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" in the movie, but not really its centerpiece. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that Maud is due on her 21st birthday. The twists and turns of the plot increase the tension, but not so much credibility, to the movie. However, no viewer will doubt that Maud and Sue will somehow end up - unlikely - as the credits roll. Although one has grown up as an ady and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a pickpocket posing as a woman's girl, the author obviously means for them to live together eventually. It is a little difficult to swallow, as each has the interaction to cheat the other. Despite these reservations, I liked movies enough. It doesn't really deserve the praise that others have made on it. The most horrible and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse, where one of the two young women has been restricted until she is able to escape and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress capable of conveying her character's cascading and changing feelings with her facial expressions and eyes. We will undoubtedly see more of her. I certainly hope so.
