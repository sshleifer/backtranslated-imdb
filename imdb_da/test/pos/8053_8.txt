Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when I first watched this movie and it left a deep impression. Not only scary, for lack of a better word this haunted movie haunted me for more than 50 years. The fun that John Larch played was scary. The only scene that was in my mind during the 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the eerie policeman who referred to her as a "little n-baby". These words were replaced when the movie was recently screened on television, maybe there are two versions of the movie, or someone felt compelled to change a little on this heartbreaking scene. It was not true that the film went a long way in formulating my opinion from the south and still until today the closest I 'I will visit a southern city is El Paso. It may be extreme, but there is a little more to the story. When the movie was shown recently, it became clearer why it haunted me for years. With the novelty as the beginning of this movie gives the impression that what is shown is actually film is apparently only made one or two years after the depicted events add to its realistic credibility. The terror in the movie is not provided by creatures or aliens, but by people living in our society at that time. Rows of Kill of Little Girl: The recent view helped clarify the impact it had on my 8 year old mind. When this movie came out, the only school I had ever gone to was attended by most African Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class was like seeing a real killing. It made a horrible scene that much worse. Maybe no one will find this review helpful, but it helped me.
