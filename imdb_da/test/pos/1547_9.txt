One of the best of 'kitchen sinks'. Great views of London and priceless extracts of the working class's life in the 60s. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, but does not make a judgment - a taste of the coming things. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it acts as a cinematic social story in Britain. Carol White is convincing that you love her, want her, will take care of her, but keep her head on her self-destructive decisions and continue to follow her in a futile hope. Well backed by Terence Stamp, (fresh from 'The Collector', also catching 'The Hit') and an abundance of English faces (everyone looks very young). Pefectly put on Donovan's dulcet tones. Stamp sings 'Yellow is the color', in a nice scene that ends with him and says, "Get better, I'm not" (song is also used in 'The Rules of Attraction' - I think) See Carol White's screen mom makes herself ready to "go out and get a blocker", put his fake eyelashes to the sound of "Rosie" on the radio - priceless. A treasure to anyone around at that time and a reminder of how well life is now in England. Incidentally, Soderburgh used clips from 'Poor Cow' in 'The Limey'.
