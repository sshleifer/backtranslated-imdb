Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ THE HOOD IS A SCENE BY-SCENE, WHOLE RIP-OFF OF THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood are focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The friend who is an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and is killed. (The athlete happens to be Washington from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'.) <br /> <br /> It makes me sad that people don't know this. It blows every time I go into a video store, and Boyz 'n Hood is in the' Drama 'section, while Cooley High is in' Comedy '. It's an embarrassing disgrace. This movie is both more fun and more dramatic than John Singleton's rip-off. At least, Singleton could have had the dignity to say that his film was a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 But, named their hit record after this movie.
