Being raised at the time this movie was released probably affected my low mind, but it's still not a bad movie in any way. It's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble. What is wrong with that? It has no great special effects, but what? Who has special effects? The cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized. A coincidence? I do not think. It became a movie with potentially good plot and feelings and made them a huge, dust-free light show for innocent children and self-medicated. Well, you know not all movies have special effects. Ca. Three-quarters of the films on the IMDb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all Top Grossing movies always have some special effects. Think of it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good movies, but the rest of the most gross films are usually clipped with non-sensual plots and lots of eye lights. Well some movies do not need new from the unwanted. Excuse me for going on a tangent that I usually do, but I'm just as tired of the special effect junk. Back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a great movie. I admit that some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but then what, each movie scratches off another to some extent. Think of resovoir dogs. Countless "appreciation pages" dictate the fact that beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I admit I like, has copied many, many, many films in the production of his first major movie Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the whole plot is ripped almost scene by scene from Japanese and Chinese gangster movies, as Mr. Tarentino loved so much and probably still does. Sorry again for the key. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers are fun. It has whole insubordination from teens to unwanted members of authority, ie hostages. It is fun to watch children take over when they are held to something they do not want to do. Hell, teenage anxiety-inspired rebellion was the main theme of the vast majority of 80's comedies. Plus there is the excitement and excitement of having the characters use firearms and knock the evil guys, etc. There are also some emotional points on the movie. When one of the characters dies, the others must clear and adjust. It's not perfect acting, but it beats most of the second trip out there. <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How do you dare jaded blowhards judge this movie badly! Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal Rating: 8/10
