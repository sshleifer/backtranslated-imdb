This is another good Western that I enjoyed. It's not an epic or something, but it's good for what it is. It is about 3 fur stairs, led by a man named Jed, who is raw and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only one standing between them and the Indian band that disturbs the Americans on their land and wants to take it back. That is the core of history. What follows is action, excitement, even a little humor and forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot about the character Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws.they both have the crusty, gruff demeanor.anyway, if you 'a western fan, you should find plenty to suffer from This particular entry.I think it deserves a 7/10
