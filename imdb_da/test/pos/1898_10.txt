Yes, it's one of the crops in the black action genre. Confusing mix of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching a disturbing pitch, even for a fan of the genre), this movie is not your axle in the park. Amazing pieces of Rudy Ray Moore's comedy stand up, which doesn't seem funny, at least not to a white boy like me, but great in context. Much better than its odd successor, "The Human Tornado"
