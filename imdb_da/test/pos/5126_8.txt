In "Hoot" a new youngster comes to Florida from Montana. He first faces the usual problems of interfering with and dealing with the local mob. But soon he becomes aware of a major problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a place in the city, where a number of grasshoppers live. This movie looks like a family movie, but it is rather more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetic how Roy and a few friends do not depart from offenses (including vandalism of private property and concise kidnap leader of chain of restaurants ) in the name of the environment (to save the owl, no less). Now one can agree with or not in these actions, but at least the film has the courage not to shy away from its beliefs. A good, solid movie, all in all.
