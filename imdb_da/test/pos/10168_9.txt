Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Were Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to see. In itself, the '56 version is a very well-finished film. In the mid to late fifties Hitchcock films (including "Rear Window", "Dial M For Murder", "Vertigo" and "Two Catch A Thief" as well as this movie) are one of my favorite periods in his career. In the man who knew too much, Jimmy Stewart was throwing himself into his role as always. Doris Day is very trustworthy in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blonde. I thought there was nothing false about her performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she is certainly not reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear", beautiful thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. <br /> <br /> There were some really clever lines written to Hank (the couple's son, who will later be kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus - it's too bad Christopher Olsen reads them so woody. It is rare to see a good performance from a children's actor in the 50s. Most of the other actors in this film were very competent, though - especially the murder (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small touches make this movie undeniably the Hitchcockian - the use of non-English dialogue, especially French (something Hitch did to a much greater extent in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of preventative Arabic music in the hotel when the murder is displayed; Stewart and Dag are talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the song's song; The Albert Hall scene, which specifically shows the musicians and the assassin's accomplices after the score, the build up of tensions, and the percussionist who gets the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it looks behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound", too). All in all, The Man Who Went Too Much is a fun movie to watch. It's not as deeply or heavily burdened with symbolism as some of his movies ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but the same is one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.
