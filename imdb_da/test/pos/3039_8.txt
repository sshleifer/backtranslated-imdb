Not only do I consider this to be the best movie ever made by Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home), but a real tribute to the teachers. Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) succeeded in reaching a group of students and bringing them from nowhere to basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods were criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs such as Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him. he did not exaggerate the role and I found him to be completely credible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to a love of education, we also see another important point in this movie. No matter how good you are at your job, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.
