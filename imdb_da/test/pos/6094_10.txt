In a style reminiscent of David Lee's best, this romantic love story celebrates across the screen with epic proportions similar to the great desert regions to which it is set. It is a movie that claims that one does not choose love, but rather that it is love that chooses, no matter who, where or when; and also that it is a matter of the heart often dependent on prevailing circumstances and circumstances. And so the situation in "The English Patient" is directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most incessant places and times, showing that when it is predetermined, love will find a way. <br /> <br /> It's WWII; Flying over the African desert, the Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane confused with a hostile plane. And even though he survives the crash, he is heavily burned. To his great happiness, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and won in a hospital. But existing conditions are governed by war conditions, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to another facility. After arriving in Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Soon, Hana discovers that her charge is something of a mysterious man when Almasy doesn't remember anything about his past, and not even his own name. Thinking of being English is the only trace that points to who he is contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, Almasy begins to call upon Hana to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who suspects Almasy is the man he has been looking for - a man with whom he wants to offset a score. But burned without recognition, Almasy may be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's reminiscent of the surface continues; reminiscent of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as reminiscent of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And the cripple in the mind and body as he is, these remembers the only thing left that he can cling to with any hope at all, even though his life seems to slip further away with every moment. <br /> <br /> In addition to managing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the manuscript for this movie, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia"; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella movie is genius realized; Designed and delivered with a poetic perfection, it looks as if a Monet comes to life. From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience, which is binding and operative, with a story that has an emotional beauty similar to the fascinating amazing and vibrant images that John Seale's remarkable cinematography has brought to life. images that almost fill the screen as well as the viewers' soul. In all respects, it is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendent. Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Support Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> Choosing a single word to describe the essence of this movie would be 'excellence'. Even an extraordinary film does not receive nine extraordinary in-class Oscars; and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here exceed the term "Oscar worthy". Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded gold for `Shine '), Fiennes has never been better and achieves an emotional depth of his character that is almost palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is by no means an individual to whom the audience can form an intimate connection; However, Fiennes finds a way to open the emotional door just enough to let you in enough, so you taste the honest passion that thrives in him. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; however, he will have your compassion. Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the "Fargo" award) for her depiction of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict that rages in her, born of the forbidden passion that slaves her and yet, as she willingly, detours her jaws of oppression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her. The reserve Katherine must preserve evokes the audience's empathy, as Scott Thomas successfully recalls the emotional depth of her character to the greatest possible effect. It is the kind of performance that pulls you in and keeps you fast and takes you as it does beyond the hypocrisy curtain that dictates what should be, if only for the sake of shadow, and allows you to experience one true sense of outrageous passion. Understated and shadowed with subtlety, it's great work by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche provides a great, affecting performance as well as the friendly nurse, Hana; It is her humanity that actually defines love in the purest sense and gives a balanced perspective on it within the framework of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a glimpse of another kind of passion that contrasts effectively with the intensity between Almasy and Katherine. "The English Patient" is a movie that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not see end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
