Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this movie (except that you have to edit the handheld technique gets really old, really fast). I watched this movie tonight in Menerbes, France. We are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered by vineyards and of course wine producers. They were all there in Salle de Polyvalente for the show-stuffed in. Polite, patient, brilliant. Although my French is testy, I got the film of the movie, but noticed that the audience loved the "old" terrorists interviewed-esp. one from a communist village in the Languedoc. He got very laughed. This is unusual in France laughing loudly. There is no doubt which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! SM
