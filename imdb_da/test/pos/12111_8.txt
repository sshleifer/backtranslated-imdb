Klaus Kinski appeared in a large number of spaghetti westerners throughout the 60s and early 70s; He was usually thrown into secondary parts as unpleasant villains. Kooky Klaus even lands a juicy leading role as Crazy Johnny Laster, a foul, twig and fake sex maniac that comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heritage to achieve its significant legacy. Johnny and his gang are called for refugees when the plan goes wrong disastrously. Author / director Mario Costa ably crafts a fiercely convincing portrait of a seriously ill and twisted piece of creeping low-time work: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone is appropriately gritty and serious, and the exciting action scenes are staged with true skill and brio (shot in rock quarries are particularly poignant and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, oozing oily charisma from every rat pore and jumping on beautiful women, every chance he gets, Kini's Johnny makes a fascinating scary and monstrous brute. Kinski is simply spectacular as this wonderfully dissuasive sign; He receives good support from the gorgeous Gabriella Giorgelli as the sweet, fiery salon girl Juanita, Steven Tedd as the cheery Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as ruthless gangster leader Machete, Giuliano Raffaella as smart lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella as Johnny's sensuous parties Glen. Kudos is also in order for Stelvio Cipriani's mood and exciting score. Well worth seeing for Kinski fans.
