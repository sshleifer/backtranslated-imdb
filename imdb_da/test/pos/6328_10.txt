A fun filled river, full of silly, if not sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best of movies, but definitely worth seeing. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming even with Granger as a particularly lovely and genial gentleman. Ava Gardner is as wonderful as ever, with such a lovely character that is absolutely annoying. The story is typical but full of jocular surprises, especially with regard to the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
