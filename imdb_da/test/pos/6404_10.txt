Right now I'm watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I looked at IMDb, which led me to read Meg's bio, which mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly whose filmography included "Key West" which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows. So I read the whole thread of reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I really loved that show too and agree with all the feelings about quirkiness and unique characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like most others, I wish it was on DVD or otherwise accessible. The last reviewer says he sees it on reruns, so I want me to know what network, channel, day, times it is on. <br /> <br /> So if anyone knows how to see episodes of "Key West" let us know.
