Irving Kershner's "Empire Strikes Back" director "Never Say Never Again", a remake of the James Bond movie "Thunderball" from 1965, does not surpass the Terence Young original, but this movie, which is not Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli , well worth seeing if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. In spite of the lack of smart gadgets and the lack of a live musical score, "Never Say Never Again" as an over-the-top thrilling doomsday player with top-flight performances featuring a spicy cast, including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The movie brushes with surprises lots of the refreshing title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but long 134 minutes. Unlike the franchise James Bond sagas with their breathtaking moments of play, "Never Say Never Again", few of these scenes are due to its banned budget. In fact, the movie has only three gadgets: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wristwatch with a laser and a soup motorcycle. Apart from the tasteful Lani Hall opening theme song, "Ice Station Zebra" leaves much to be desired by the composer Michel Legrand's orchestral music. Legrand does not replicate any of these juggling jazz cues that made John Barry's music the regular Bond franchise so memorable. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems to fit more into the first two Bond films "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" with regard to the downward approach to the Earth's approach to the topic. <br /> <br /> "Never say again" presents Sean Connery's James Bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and been taken by active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was one year older than Connery and Moore's Bond films treated as 007 as an active young guy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent, and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple play that emphasizes Bond's age. Originally, Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece, but mercifully wiser minds reign and Connery sports a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and looks better than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed to "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last minute to replace John Gavin. Connery had worked on another movie and had emphasized the role he couldn't remove in time for "Diamonds Are Forever." In 52 years, Connery still has a youthful power here despite the script's proven demands. The plot unfolds with 007 singular attempts to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He sends several guards armed with machine guns and releases the woman only to get her to stab him with a knife in the side when he doesn't see. It seems that this whole sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Jackal Day") to test Bond's ability. The new M does not share its predecessor use of field agents. M decides that Bond must clean his system of all "free radicals" and have 007 packed to Shrublands. While at the country clinic, Bond notes suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and is noticed seeing them. The nurse is none other than SPECTER assassin Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera from "The Island of Dr. Moreau") and she is responsible for ensuring that no one sees USF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy from "Superman 3") . Petachi is part of a SPECTER plan of millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer from "Out of Africa") to swim the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a double eye into Captain Petachi, which has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order weapon processing. After stealing weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush runs away from the road by throwing his pet snake into his lap and then putting an explosive in his broken car and blowing him up. In fact, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", except for the SPECTER Planning Conference, belongs to Fatima when she monitors Petachi's stay at the clinic and then tries repeatedly to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with one explosive device. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bond meets the beautiful blonde Domino (Kim Basinger of "Mother Lode") and sneaks into Largo's charity bank at a Monte Carlo casino where the two turn into a detailed video game called " Domination 'to see who is to control the world. Bond orders him, and Largo hates him twice now because 007 is his only rival with Domino and a thorn in his side, which even Fatima does not seem to be able to remove. Bond and Fatima have it out after a motorcycle hunt when he returns and blows her up. Their previous encounter in the Bahamas, when attaching a unit to lure a shark after him, is rather lame. Like in the original "Thunderball", the bad guys restore the hijacked nuclear weapons at sea, but only the warheads themselves. Bond flies to the Bahamas, where he meets his diplomatic cooperation, Nigel Small-Fawcett (no less than Rowan Atkinson from "Mr. Bean" fame, who is worried that Bond can kill someone and destroy the island paradise. Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the movie's source of comic relief, the CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey of the "Pistols of the Magnificent Seven") to back up Bond, this is the first time an African-American portrait Leiter Bond experiences his share of the problems, saving Domino from Arab slaves, while Leiter and he save the world "Never say again" is a truly respectable James Bond thriller with many nice details, but it never generates the danger of franchise Bond movies. ", looks like a worthy masterpiece theater takes on 007.
