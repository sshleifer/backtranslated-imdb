I caught the first screening of driving lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can trade past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is wonderful as the indulgent mother. Julie Walters is fun as Lady Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope this movie is downloaded by an American distributor so everyone can see it. This film is not just about driving lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is struck between listening to his indulgent mother and pastor and wants to live his own life. It's a great movie, from a great instructor who has taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see, and anyone who can, should.
