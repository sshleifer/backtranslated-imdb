I lost The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie Network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker made his brother Luke confess to murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories about Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and on Courttv. Morrison Murders is a great movie to watch. Next time Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv, I will see Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it's a good movie about Walker trying to figure out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby, and in the end Walker discovers that it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
