This movie from B&W reached the Spartan film house in my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. These days, much of our full comedy ticket was taken from Denmark (Nils Poppe anyone?) So this movie hit like a thunderbolt - it cried me with helpless joy, ROTFL, as we would now say it. OK, so some of the sight gags were actually reused vaudeville 'schtick', but how was this "barefoot boy with cheek skin" to know it at that time? In any case, my favorite scenes had Jerry's unique brand of hectic clowning, such as the Hawaiian boxing match. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Sailor Beware" again thirty-five years later, I still enjoyed high in the hallway. Granted, without the nostalgia component, it would probably be another fair-to-medium comedy. But then another movie that once made me feel even more helpless was that the Spike Jones excursion "Fireman Save My Child" now appears to be dated and stolen from some short orchestral bits and Doodles Weaver scenes. Must be a special ingredient that makes the Martin & Lewis product more fresh. For me, this is at least eight out of ten.
