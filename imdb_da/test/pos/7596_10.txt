It doesn't matter whether drew or leelee is a total child, but there are many girls who are so beautiful and warm, but they seem to be so miserable. This film is not an Oscar-type movie, but it certainly has a good view of what life is for young or for "real" people. It made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. This movie represents the real world and what really matters.
