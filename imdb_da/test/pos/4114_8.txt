Much better than it is generally given credit for, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had great music and beautiful scenery, but also some amazing mountain photography. A special edition laser disk was released some years ago, adding more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music and lots of bonus material. So why isn't it on DVD? It's hard to see the studios out sometimes. Certain roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodic pipes? Singing and dancing Bobby Van is fun, Michael York is an appropriate tragic villain and sees Sir John Gielgud embellished as Chang may sound silly, but actually works very well on the screen. Trust me, you have to check out this movie - if you can find it!
