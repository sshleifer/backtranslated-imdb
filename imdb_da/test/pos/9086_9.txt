Can't be very scary than Flatliners. This deep, dark film had my heart pumped through. The lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death-enhancing experience, literally. Keifer is in top form, as he is today for 24 years. He is a great actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget in the years to come. And what can you say to the rest of the cast? Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin light the scene in this thriller, which keeps you in the grip of your seats. It is a refreshing sight to see a real thriller, with professional actors. You will not regret seeing this 2 hour seatbelt. JL
