The retelling of a classic story is set to Burt Bacharach's music and lyrics from Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this adventure in the outside world with mysterious Shangra-la. It's a pleasure to see Bobby Van, whose play puts me in the mind of the Red Buttons, and as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who always manages to carry gravity in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the older High Lama. Who would have known? <br /> <br /> The all-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a goalie for those of us who care for people.
