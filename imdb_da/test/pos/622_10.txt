This is a very good movie. I give it a 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different because it's a bit of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the protagonist is dumb is used throughout history in a very credible way. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a snus movie) and decides to run, but gets chased (it takes a while). I don't want to reveal the rest of the movie because it would ruin the experience, but be sure: it's very trustworthy, well-played, very intense and has some great surprises plus a great ending. Don't miss this movie.
