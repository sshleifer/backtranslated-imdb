Just this in the mail, and I was pleasantly surprised. As a big fan of the 70's cinema, it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks. In spite of the obvious low budget of this movie, the play is generally good, and you can already see why Pesci would be on the greatest actors ever. I'm not sure how real this movie is, but it's probably a good contribution to the mob genre .....
