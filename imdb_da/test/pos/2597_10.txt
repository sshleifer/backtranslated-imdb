There is only one movie I can think of that can be as good or better than this when it comes to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. But it is not relevant to decide which is the best, but just watch them both and enjoy. I compared this with ALI BABA BUNNY because both have Daffy in their absolute worst - greedy, unpleasant and very fun in the process. But I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs are also pretty horrible in this - doing horrible things right back to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. <br /> <br /> The movie starting with Daffy leaving the rabbit tracks up to Bugs' hole hoping that a hunter (of course, Elmer) will blow up the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Not to be outdated, Bugs repeatedly takes all Daffy's tricks and turns them around - and in most cases, Daffy involves being shot in the face! It's all very, very smart and fun, and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you're a grouch. I especially love the big and unexpected end, but I don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil the surprise.
