I watched this interesting movie back to back with the Chinese / French movie "2046" at the latest Dubai Film Festival. Both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). Both had the protagonists of a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more of a metaphor of exile than a location. Both were about love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and riveting performances. What a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in the treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man turns on a sidewalk to look at a woman and thus hits a lamp post. The audience breaks into a shady volcano. But is it not so succinct that the film's synopsis that entertains you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful mix of black comedy (eg, using a stethoscope to listen to the neighbor's conversation), the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had introduced to the cinema earlier - stoic faces leading to comedy as opposed to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the heartfelt Danny Kaye. A sudden activity activity transforms an otherwise stoic character, while you move money from the hotel to the bank reminiscent of Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not just comedy. The anti-automation statement (cash count and the bank's response to its statements, the dummy that acts as an ineffective warning to the fast lady, the reference to "Moulimix" as the fictional "company" he works for, etc.) are several signs of that the director offers a loaded comedy to the viewer. Hurry, but reflect on it and enjoy further. <br /> <br /> The film's strength lies in a short, staccato script (by director Paul Sorrentino) featuring comedy mixed with philosophy ("The truth is boring" "Father is dead, but no one told him. "There is no luck - it is the invention of the losers and the poor." Then the instructor continues to give you a fascinating lecture from the protagonist of Sorrentino providing entertainment related to the topic the Italians know best - the Mafia. is an existential mafia movie, ever since "The truth is boring", the director gives a dessert as part of the fine meal of excellent acting (Toni Servillo), good music, smart camera work (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (Magnani, granddaughter of great Anna) and strong script. The dessert is for the viewer to find out what was ahead of the movie was the truth. It would have been boring, I f it was it?
