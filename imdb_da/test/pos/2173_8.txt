Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen I've seen in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with excellent characterization, from Depardieu's lost Chabert to Fabrice Luchini's proud lawyer to Fanny Ardant's complex widow. The film has a wonderful dimension that one might expect from a top film photographer like Yves Angelo. The characters hold this movie in gear, and although it is a little slow at first, picks up the tempo and is a nice movie when it reaches the finish.
