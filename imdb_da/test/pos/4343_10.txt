This classic has so many great one-liners and unintentional hilarious scenes that I don't even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, this is here. Just completely ignore the person you want and then clear classic lines like "Chicken is good ... I like chicken" and before you know it you will have a one-night in a basement (it's a NICE cellar) with a woman who is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does everything in this movie. He buys a car for no reason just because he can kill two gang members ... pay with "CASH" ...... chunnng .... He buys an ice cream simply because "this is America, it's not" It doesn 't end up wasting anyone called "the gigger - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. That way, this "giggler" is so fast that Bronson's regular gun can't even get him. he has to order a special just to get this unpleasant crib, he gets cleaned up so he can eat a really smelly meal (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothes in 90 degree weather "He goes into the dentist. He always seems to find a crab when he needs one (and that's the same!). And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket bomb available, just if he is to throw away Richie Cunningham's elder brother Chuck, who is now stretched and in need of a makeover. Anyway, we l all make sense once you've seen this classic ... all i can say is enjoy! "I owed you that a DUDE"
