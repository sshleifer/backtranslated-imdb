I saw Forgiving Franklins at a Paramount screening and loved it. I have to be honest, I really didn't want to go, and I had been pretty much left about the movies that were made today, I have to tell you Forgiveness The Franklins were fresh and wonderfully put together, I laughed my ass out, it was great story story, I couldn't believe that two guys shot this and put it all together. I thought if these guys could make a movie like this with this budget, imagine what they could do with big money behind them. And then I thought to be the fired guy, I would probably have the studios ... anyway. When it comes to thanks, boys, I lost and in your movie, and therefore I go to the cinema to forget the world for a few hours.
