I've seen almost every Coen brothers movie now and I have to say this is one of their better movies. I wouldn't dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski" but it was very good in itself. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was very interesting and fun at times. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro's (Pete). There really is nothing bad I can say about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. It may be safe to say that if you liked the other Coen brothers' films, then you will hopefully like this too. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you would like the movie, but don't stick to it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you like (d) the movie as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
