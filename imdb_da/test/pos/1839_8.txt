This movie doesn't have any kind of good art, which is good. But it is a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid plays. I think if I wrote it, I could do without a drama about wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story of Minnie Driver's character. I think too often, Hollywood is attempting a true quality script to try and inject more visual drama when the emotional drama with an adult film is the only one really needed - and probably more credible. Overall, it is a very well-offered offer and worth seeing.
