As a Sci-fi movie fan, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It goes well with the Alien series. But it's no stranger, it's something else. OK enough comparisons. This movie but I think: Why people are afraid of darkness. You can't run away from the dark. It is impossible. You must be confronted with darkness and with what is in the dark. In this movie I also liked that the Vin Diesel character Richard B. Riddick was not typically a good boy. He had secrets, and he has done bad things in the past. To the other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all, he wants to get out of this planet himself. There are also other metaphors in this story. Every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.
