This movie is amazing because of the fact that it turned out how good cartoons really looked like in the 80s, the animators were not lazy as they are today, the comic book had so much detail with very few resources they have with them compared to what we have today. If more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television again, therefore to finish my phrase I just want to say this was a cartoon I grew up with and really want to like having it again on TV.
