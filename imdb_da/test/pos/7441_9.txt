I like this movie a lot. The animation is highest: means that they went into trouble to animate the hair and fur of animals and humans. And being an amateur in graphics and animation (self-teaching even through books. For those who are curious about the same, I use the Gmax program of Discrete. It's a free quality program that can be downloaded from the Internet). I see that the quality of the animation shown here is of high standards. <br /> <br /> The reason for this movie is good. Although this film lacks character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I think this movie should be primarily monitored by people who are fans of the game as its plot closely follows the game. For me, I don't play the games and therefore I don't have the wowing effect it probably does on fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I suggest this movie to you, and if you haven't played the game, I still recommend this movie to you.
