One of Fuller's (a war veteran himself) early works of average quality, but precisely hits the many conflicting aspects of life in the post-war period. The protagonist starts the movie in April 45 as a Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, who really ended the war in Munich as in the movie. (The same unit in the previous month had fought strongly in Aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the Dachau plant). For the uninformed, the film may seem confusing by flip-flocking between showing the good and bad of the German people. But anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie is something that really happened in 45-47 Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was less: While on a boat trip on the Rhine, he passed the remains of the Remagen bridge, he noticed that he was crossing there. But his unit crossed really well south of there - north of Worms Germany.
