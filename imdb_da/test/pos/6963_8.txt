The lovely, yet deadly Alexandra (stunning statuette blonde beauty Stacie Randall, who looks completely into a thin black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet so her evil demon master Faust can cross into our dimension. It's up to fearless, robust politician Jonathan Graves (resembling Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, two pitiful spooky "comic relief" dwarf gnome creatures run amok in Los Angeles. Experienced veteranship exploitation expert Jim Wynorski tells the high inane story at a rapid pace and takes none of this stupidity externally seriously. The fought fight gamely with the stupid material: The sweet Barbara Alyn Woods as sassy, ​​retrieves police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as tart, sexy hooker Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves bumbling, exciting partner Scotty, Peggy Trentini as astonishing museum consultant Monica , and Ace Mask as the jolly Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi's puerile cookie cutter script, an entertaining lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, Chuck Cirino's bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf boys sporting obvious cheap rubber Halloween masks, JE Bash's simple filmography, no excitement or free female nudity to talk about, and However, the sticky (less than) special effects enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this primary slice of celluloid Velveeta. An entertaining brainless part of lovably miserable dragon.
