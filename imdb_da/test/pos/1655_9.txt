Rififi is a great movie that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man comes out of jail and plans another job. It is a used story, but this is different from the others. They round off the usual suspects to the job. This film takes a look at how the family is being torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of an exciting soundtrack, the instructor decided to silence about thirty minutes of silence. This fits perfectly into the mood and is often copied these days. Of course, things get out of hand and people die, and it ends in a big end that is built up in excitement. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a great movie noir that not many people talk about this is a good choice.
