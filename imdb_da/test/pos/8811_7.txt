Cardiff, Wales. A group of 5 friends are deeply bored in this city. There is Jip working in a clothing store. Coop, an easy DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing: the weekend. At this point they came to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music, they experience different substances, especially ecstasy. Then they usually continue with the party to a friend. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the emotions are as follows: Fatigue, melancholy, just reminiscent of a crazy night ... Surfing the wave of the infamous success "Trainspotting" (1996) brings and develops this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan a new variation on the concept of hedonism. That means: How you have fun as much as possible while you know you have a shortened time. In fact, as I have previously written, for the five main characters in the film, the week is hell, and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single touch (in addition, Jip speaks in a sequel on the positive aspects By shooting oneself: You are numb, you do not feel pressured, you are like an astronaut in orbit over the earth. Kerrigan's relentless style is very much in the spirit of debauchery and carefreeness of the 5 main characters. as possible by a hedonistic week-end. To spice up the festive atmosphere where his movie is bathing, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream-like sequences representing his characters' imagination or embarrassment "Human Traffic" (1999) is also served with a particularly jumping soundtrack. The crowd? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. Finally, this week's end of euphoria allows for a moment to celebrate a moment, even if a movie (conscientious or e j) exploits the fame of another famous, rarely matches the brilliance of its British cinema. predecessor. "Human traffic" is in this state. There is little ingenuity at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters, and you can note down a few useless digressions (Jip, who in the nightclub enters the manager's office and tells him a dick and lighthouse story to allow Moff to get into the club, but it's not needed because the latter succeeds in getting in trouble). You can also blame Kerrigan for overlooking the dramatic aspects that history could have involved. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not practically explored. It's a shame! It could have conveyed the following message: Even in the happiest moments, there can be something terrible to prepare that can flop them. The same remark can also be said when Coop has jealousy because Nina smiles a guy. It may not be the last big movie from the 1990s, as it is billed on the DVD cover, but "Human Traffic" must be taken as a good and sharp little movie that communicates with styles and fashion styles at the end of the twentieth century, a willingness to have fun without ulterior motives and problems. An ideal movie to start a party or before going to a club.
