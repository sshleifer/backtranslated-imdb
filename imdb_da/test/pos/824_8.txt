I haven't seen a Van Damme flick for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it, looks older, but harder, like Sly, becomes more robust in age. This is a good flip and has made me look at all the Van Damme movies I have missed over the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has the reasons to amaze the audience, the last movie seen with Van Damme was Legionnaire, it was also a good flick. In addition, I realized in Van Damme's early fight history, and also my amazement I realized that he is the right deal, very successful martial artist in his younger years.
