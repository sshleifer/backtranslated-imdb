I watched this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just finished my biomedical job in a hospital. I consider the script an exaggeration of the right type of thing going on in hospitals. <br /> <br /> The idiots who put it down on the production value do not get the point and have probably never been hospitalized. And have never worked in a safe. Billy Jack (same era) was very poorly produced, but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message. I've been looking for this movie ever since, this is the first page I've found where it is mentioned.
