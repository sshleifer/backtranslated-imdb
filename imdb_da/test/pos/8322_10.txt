As John Grierson pointed out, "The documentary genre can be defined as this: The creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This amazing 180-minute documentary is the first time a computer-generated dinosaur project respects the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I had expected with great excitement, I was very disappointed. Of course, the dinosaurs were big, but the storytelling was unnecessary. I thought, "What if they made a documentary on dinosaurs without crying children or bad sayings, only dinosaurs made as realistic as possible to let us marvel at what was once reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC has made an exciting documentary that explores the various erases of the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all the people who seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points about behavior, skin patterns, etc. Of course, they must. No one was there. I think it's great that they could present something as realistic as that. The guesses are all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists, and it allows the viewer to have a good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, just visit a dinosaur leg museum. Therefore, I incorporated the Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> At least hats off to the creators of it.
