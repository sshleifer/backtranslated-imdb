For people like me who were born long after the 60s ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, of which "Hair" is one. This is definitely a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group goes down into the party of the rich people. With regard to the film's last scene, one can interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the 60s represented. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you interpret this movie, it is important to understand that even though the 60s can be completed, the movements that typed them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time that people won't soon forget. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another big here just between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Guck's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a piece of shit as "Man on the Moon"?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
