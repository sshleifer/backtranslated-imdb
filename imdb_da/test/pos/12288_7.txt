This is not a movie is a smart, witty and often heart touching movie. It's a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his alien Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael down on his luck deciding to make a documentary replaying his entire relationship and what went wrong. He utilizes his friendship with an actor he met at Nadia's gym (Nadia Dajani), which he gets to play Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michael's relationship is shown from every point, whether high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell draws a fantastic achievement that will help him find Grace. If most characters fall out of big performances except the puzzle. The puzzle player is needed to move the plot together, but seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop. His monologues are often coated and meaningless. This is proven when he says, "Out of this chaos we are all trying to make orders. And out of order, meaning. But in reality there is no such thing as meaning. Something only makes sense if we make it mean . "<br /> <br /> The comment stores this movie. Comment made in vain This is Spinal Tap and has Michael and his brother explain the problems they had while making the movie. Michael offers a very fun self-conscious comment that gives some very good stomach ache. Overall I will give this movie a 7/10.
