Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to get this on DVD in a local store sale. Â£ 2.99 seems like a bargain, and that's it. Thing is the movie called "To Kill For". It took a little detective work to find out the original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK, it has been rated as 18 and rightly, even though the film's standard depends on "the ability to sell". Having seen Final Destination 3 yesterday, in my opinion, it should have been a 18. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's lovely, Traci Lords is in what tends to step up the rating board up to 18 Such a shame. Traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in large and large budget productions. She is able to turn what is labeled a B movie into a fine performance, nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br /> Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
