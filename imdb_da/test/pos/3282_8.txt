ManBearPig is a pretty fun episode of South Park. The spoof's Al Gore and his talk about global warming, which only replaces global warming with ManBearPig (a fictional monster that has parts of a man, a bear, and a pig). He tells the boys about it in a school assembly, and Stan feels sorry for him, so he and the boys decide to hang out with him. Gore eventually gets them caught in a stone cave where he thinks manbearpig must be and they are stuck in days. However, Cartman finds treasure but wants to keep everything to himself. ManBearPig is a good spoof on Global Warming and generally a fun South Park episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
