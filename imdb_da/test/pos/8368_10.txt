I was born in Beijing, China and moved to the United States at the age of 9. Went to Beijing several times ago and loved it every time. One of the many things I love about Beijing are the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hao hao shuo" (which translates more precisely to "if you have something to say, say it nicely") leaks and mistakenly the feeling of Beijing. I suppose you should have lived in and just understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, even if you might enjoy it. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberately a bit odd, and captivating. I will let it unfold itself and not tell you too much except some comments. Every detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets and the restaurants feels like home. (Zhang Yimou probably shot everything "on the spot") But more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the friendly but unfortunate "portable man" and the night club owner each native of Beijing and loved in their different ways. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, which is mainly driven by situations and conversation (sparing the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is exciting and always interesting. <br /> <br /> I'm 21 now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed at Zhang Yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into credible screen characters and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "Keep cool" - different. hysterically funny. meaningful.
