Midnight Madness is a movie that unfortunately is very undervalued and not appreciated. With a flood of classic "edgy" teen / college movies, this one was forgotten. As a child I wanted to watch this movie over and over again, fortunately I had it on video. This film shows a more tame but most exciting side of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in this day and age, with drug abuse being the "coolest" thing, it's good to see a fun, innocent movie that is Midnight Madness ... once in a while ... that's if You can find it.
