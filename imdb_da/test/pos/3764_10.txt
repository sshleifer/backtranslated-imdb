Some said this was a nostrils glorification flick, but short of the original Dr. Hyde's concoction, no substance has yet been developed that can give this effect. If Viagra was the mucus, the white sparkling powder is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung (or at least the pharmaceutical idiot savant compartment). This reality show is really about the sacred medical cows, seen as the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the healthcare sector; Both because most of us would not have lived to our present age, we had been born before "modern medicine" and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live if we trust the helping profession. So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of the Calcutta Bessys, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern medical institution. The time was right and many could see the business side of the healing companies behind Oz's curtain. A decade before, when George C. Scott ran through the movie The Hospital, my wife and I were in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City. As in Jekyll & Hyde's remake, we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat and laughing and shouting uncontrollably in duration. Hundreds of other members of the audience were deadly silent. They were shocked that doctors, nurses, and the hospital were mocked. It was as if the pope, billy graham and gandhi were sitting in the animal house, beer-colored tee shirts and everyone was competing to see who could tell the funniest god knock-knock jokes between belches. Had the hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they could have seen what was shown to them. Unfortunately, they were as Republicans on a screening of Michael Moore's 9/11. Perhaps less golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical executives, health insurance companies would have had a harder time denying medical treatment, and healthcare providers would have been demystified earlier if George C. Scott had lost his dances in a tutu while delivering his horrible truths. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the film, deliberately made so happy and happy and full of laughter as the best ever Saturday Night Live shit, and let the subconscious ink in the documentary about the underlying reality. Simply blame me when "Got to come to" becomes one of your words, or when "Hyde has nothing to hide" captures that part of your brain that is now paralyzed by "It's a small world after all". Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even Oklahomans shifted their favorite horrible boss's desires campaign from "Piss on him and let him be dead" to "Body in a pit, you in it ....." The scent of death ... it's gone! Chicken sushi! Mary. MARY. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
