[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also instructed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in the latest memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr pauses to play greasy beings for being the lovely guy facing his fiancé to sleep other people and he is allowed to do so too. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good in "Tully", plays spunky and vulnerable with great joy. Too bad she does not get the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br /> Good supportive performances also help immensely. Lauren Graham, who made last year's "Bad Santa" memorable, plays the shabby, cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (father of TV's "Malcolm in the Middle") gets a few fun, raunchy moments, and Andy Richter plays a brilliant guy who falls for a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, albeit known, role as a mousy woman. What surprised me most about "Seing Other People" was how fun it is. There are some real laughs here. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some beautiful lines, and there is a ménage a trois that evokes one of the most truthful reactions of a man as the male imagination becomes fine. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is not unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who was thinking about it, much to Ed (Chr. Ed). Considering the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple work through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea, but the human element puts it. <br /> <br /> I didn't appreciate Forbes and Wolodarsky making this a cheap sex romp. Yes, there are sex and nudity, but there are also real feelings at work here. "Other People" Alice and Ed are friends, will not be the objects of casual sex; they also have feelings. In one case, too many emotions. Given, some scenes run a joke for many, the Richter-Slater subplot is not necessary, and Alice does something really uncharacteristic. But it is forgiveness because Mohr and Nicholson create so much intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where Ed through Alice's underwear or his reaction to her announcement to end the experiment - no matter how much we can enjoy their little game, root for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was slightly, if any, advertising and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often bounce on the creepy, turgid and surprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and fun movie.
