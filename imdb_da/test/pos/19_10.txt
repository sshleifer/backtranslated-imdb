This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only drawback is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts that showed the actors individually rather than together as a scene, but the performance was so great that I forgive him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful; brilliant. The scripture is amazing, giving a very good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and therefore also in the 30s). Lots of beautiful, subtle touches, lots of wide, spiked strokes, all done perfectly. The scene after scene blows me straight away, and then there is the heartbreaking climax.
