Woaww Is it only now that you notice the connections between all the characters ?? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond, any deja vu ??? Yes !! He was the "same" guy who gave money to Sayid after killing or torturing the other soldier in the episode 14th of the 2nd season: One of Them. Well, in fact, it's not quite the same guy he's called Joe in the 14th episode and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Twins ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not even sure of it :) There are hundreds of links like this between all the characters. <br /> <br /> But it was only in response to the Libby comment. <Br /> <br /> I found these 2 episodes far more interesting than the entire season 2. Throughout that season, I felt that there were many things I missed and very few things I learned. Especially in the beginning, the first episode of the 2nd season is excellent and the second is a kind of flash back of the first. I found it disappointing, although I'm pretty sure everything in Lost tends to be meaningful. It was just an example of how I was frustrated to see these episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we've learned more new things in the 2 episodes than throughout the season. But all we learn is small pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of Desmon's "relatives" (sorry if I spoil too much, believe me or not, I'm not trying to) for example. So many things that have been developed in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once so nothing. And still there is new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. We all want to see the big picture of it all, of course, but I think we have to be very patient. I hope there will be only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I will see more than 3 seasons anyway. There were also lots of actions in the very first episode. And a good cliffhanger at the end. <br /> <br /> So basically, yes, I loved the last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
