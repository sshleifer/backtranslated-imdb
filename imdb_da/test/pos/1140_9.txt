This is the type of movie that may need to be seen several times to capture all its beauty and intelligence {like the 1957 Curse of Frankenstein}. If you don't like weird, non-mainstream movies, remove this masterpiece. For me, the artwork in this movie alone is worth the purchase price of the video cassette. The story is a bit amazing, but seems to become reality in our world today. To be produced in the 1980s, this film shows to be a prophetic vision of what should come with Big Government and Big Brother who want to control and monitor us. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections, and the dialogue can be very difficult to capture in many scenes (that's why I've seen it 6 times now}, but if you can digest it all, it may turn out to be worth your time. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only worried about accumulating and growing. The movie's hero is not subject to this disease and has not been "tagged" and watched by big brother. His mission is to release a secret substance into the water supply that will change the way in which human robots think and allow individualism to be part of humanity again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's very low budget, but for its time, the effects and sound effects of the computer are very unique and the paintings are absolutely fascinating. If you have an open mind, this movie must impress and its prophetic visions cool.
