"Pixote" is the most powerful, shocking and moving movie that comes from Brazil. It's about the street kids' lives on the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, and it's centered around a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them around in an almost documentary style, from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff are as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. Prostitution, drug abuse / trafficking, corruption and murder are all witnesses to these youths; But it is something they are painfully used to. Director Hector Babenco used real street kids as the actors and added the movie's brutal reality. Although not for everyone, I recommend a movie. An emotionally damaging movie. <br /> <br />
