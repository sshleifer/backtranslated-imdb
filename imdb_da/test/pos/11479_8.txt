Yesterday I finally met my curiosity and saw this movie. My knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds by the trailer, but I had heard some good critics who made my expectations rise. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, these unbound pieces were combined into a story that became quite exciting, with some seemingly inexplicable details.
