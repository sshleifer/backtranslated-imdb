First of all, the whole script is mostly improv and adds to the amazing illusion that what we see is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors employed by Watkins were purposefully selected to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are real hippies, the government officials (but not necessarily in the government itself) are certainly conservative within the system, and several of the police are actual police officers. The interplay between these actors, given the textual freedoms conferred by Watkins, eventually comes to a violent head, where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot. (We hear him screaming "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> An amazing movie, although American critics were quite tough in their reviews, was actually reported to be the "most offensive" movie she ever seen. This not entirely unexpected as revealing this oppressive communist-like mentality in America in this age would surely rattle some cages. This pseudo-documentary definitely requires an open mind, but if you look seriously for an intense accurate depiction of the 60's culture, it would be the movie to watch.
