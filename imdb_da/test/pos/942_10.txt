The Australian audience and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough good Aussie movies around or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It's unique - it will make you laugh a lot, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel really good about yourself. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is amazing and the play is second to none. Scripture and photography (color / light, etc.) are wonderful. But more importantly, it's a good movie. I don't want to talk about the plot as I always think it is best to watch a movie that knew as little about it as possible. Suffice it to say that this movie will appeal to a wide range of audiences. Take your girlfriend, take your mother, take your friends - for a good night. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
