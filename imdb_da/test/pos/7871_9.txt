I watched this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. First, I was confused by how the story moved together, but then I realized that it was only a scene that was shown again and again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> Initially, you think the clerks are shouting for a teenager to steal. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris teenagers played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. The clergy perspective dispels that view. I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes. Excellent short film. Hopefully, director James Cox can turn into a movie of his own length with the same casting, or win over with a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
