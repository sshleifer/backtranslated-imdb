I was enchanted by Niami's debut. I hope we will soon see more of his work. I was fortunate enough to catch the movie during its short NYC round and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks like Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble cast plays mostly against the type was a pleasure. And I thought the complex inter-threaded plots were just right. Sandra Bernhard puts in his best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is fun and Ling Bai touches. See it.
