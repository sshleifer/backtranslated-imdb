"Four Daughters" begins as another clone of "Little Women" type melodrama. A single father with four musically talented daughters has his hands full and tries to keep them in line and lead them in their court rituals. What turns the movie about is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero, long before James Dean graced the big screen. From the time that the dark, perishable figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears on Ann Lemp's (Priscilla Lane) port, jumping its self-pity and condemned philosophy to the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes much more than just a chick flick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason for seeing "Four Daughters", there are other gleams to enjoy. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz, who is later responsible for such gemstones as "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", indicates certain images with his camera (aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller of "Rebel Without a Cause" fame) sitting in viewers Mind, for example, the screaming gate that Ann's first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn) swings so diligently, becomes symbolic of the shift in moods and feelings of those who use it. <br /> <br /> The Garfield provides standout performance It's obvious, but the rest of the throw stays the most with him. Underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays her role in perfection as the neglected suitor whose love of his beloved Ann never falls, even when she is with another man. Claude Rains, who is somewhat mistaken as the father of the four young women who come after age, gives a fine portrayal of a set of doting family heads lost in shuffle. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical abilities, turn into talented actresses, playing their parts well. A number of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make it all credible. <br /> <br /> Where opposites attract is part of the jersey to move quickly to viewers' imagination. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out. She always looks on the bright side and looks like so many trapped in the great forceps pliers in the days she saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey recites a whole list of bad things that happened to him seeking business in his misery from Ann, whom Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to go out with a zipper that hits him dead as he rounds the corner of life. Mickey has low talent as a composer; Ann has the talent to save as a singer and musician. Ann is great at beauty; Mickey is great at personality in a combed sense of a way. And the differences continue and continue. How all this is united in the end is an important part of the movie, not to be missed. See "Four Daughters" for John Garfield's doozy of a acting debut on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later when he again told the movie guests with one of the biggest screen performances ever, like Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Rings Twice", as opposed to the straight charismatic Lana Turner. But also see "Four Daughters" to capture important elements that must be missed if there is too much concentration on the star of the show.
