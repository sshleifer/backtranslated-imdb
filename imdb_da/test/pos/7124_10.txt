Best fan boy movie I've ever seen, saves "Free Enterprise." <br /> <br /> In some ways, it reminded me of an early Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> If you do any role-playing game, this movie will likely make you laugh often at its insatiable fun. Don't expect a big budget here, the play is also questionable at times, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The script is really humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> Bard, who is always killed, made me roll. The sexually confused player also had me smiling a little too. But in the end ... It was just a great movie that showed some better moments in a few geeks life that had a good time with role playing. <br /> <br /> If you get bored and ever play the role, this will do well for a distraction. A real unexpected treat.
