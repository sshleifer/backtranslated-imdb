This movie biography of the early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are Busey's stage performances, where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the notion that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious tooth glare lights up on the screen, he creates a completely credible and winning personality, and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows Holly's career from adult up in Lubbock, Texas to the star chamber and New York and his incredible death in a plane crash. One thing I found interesting if it was true was Buddy's driving ambition - he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance for production. As young as he was, he was already established as a sharp businessman and would certainly take things to a higher level. We will never know if he would ultimately catapult his early success to a business mark like The Rolling Stones. The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are quite young; read the lyrics of "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" And you will see what I mean. Perhaps it explains his popularity to a large extent with young audiences, but his instrumentation and stage performances certainly account for his influence on groups to follow - both The Rolling Stones and The Beatles have acknowledged his importance. <br /> <br /> It was clear that some freedoms were taken for dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly has ever knocked out a manufacturer in Nashville or that the audience at New York's Apollo Theater was so immediately responsive to being wildly dancing in the hallways. If you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985) produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging Paul McCartney. This includes interviews with Holly's family, friends and bandmates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories, and there are recordings of ancient Holly performances. The McCartney production can stand on its own, but it makes an excellent companion to "The Buddy Holly Story" and perhaps needs viewing for anyone who sees the fictional story.
