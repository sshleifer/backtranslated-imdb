Snakes on a Plane was such a well-hyped movie that it was both inevitable and a little crazy trying to release another movie of almost the same title in the same year, let alone the same week. Reading the other comments here I see the results. A lot of people are sour. Food because it doesn't have the best special effects. Food because it does not have a cast. Food because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say "I'm sick of these M ^ * & * &% - Is F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes on this M ^ * & * &% - Is F * ^% -ng Train "! <br /> <br /> It's probably not the Samuel Jackson version. And maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Plane was lost between copfilm and horror, a family movie and a bloody gory movie of death Saturday Night Live performing artists laughed while Jackson swore enough to get grandmother to cover their ears and as far as the kids go, they will be traumatized by the violence. <br /> <br /> Snakes On a Train, however, knew exactly what it was, this was a cheap made horror movie on a train, it was probably snakes and probably many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects, it lacks a step in its plot or intention where as the "on a plane" version tripping completely over itself from the first scene on. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it over the fun that snakes on an airplane had to offer and I admit that "... on a train" version was a little dry. But hey in trading it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have gone much more wrong than it did. <br /> <br /> For this it gets a 7 out of 10.
