The Stepford children, besides being very good at television films, show the very disruptive result of indoctrination. It is quite an account of how to be done to act within the framework of what is considered "good" behavior can destroy what it is that makes a person unique and an individual. I think this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some portrayal of thought that loams into hearts and minds of young people should keep an eye on their children and discuss what the film is saying. I do not know if it was in any way intended for this movie, but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best film schemes against the desire to make the children adhere to an unrealistic and dominant notion of what is in the best interest of anyone other than the children themselves. I hope one day watch this movie on DVD. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
