I can't quite explain why I find this so excellent and "Leopard" not; This may be because the focus here is on everything that was great about the movie, the intimate moments that Visconti can make so wonderful. Like that movie, it has a majestic slow pace, but this time it is not long lasting. This is the kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes pass by. I think it is due in part to how the movie deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. Like the "Leopard", it has a sympathetic leadership that brings out the same kind of worn-out pathos - although Bogard's performance is more willing to open up to be unlikely, especially in appearance: he has a really stupid laugh that is not easy to do. suffer. It is often pretty beautiful in the quiet moments. It is the abundance of Visconti's film, the scenery of grandeur that I find boring, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here it is part of the point - Gustav is surrounded by a visual dance. <br /> <br /> The way in which Gustav's love is introduced to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, feminine-featured boy. It is like a reference to Shakespeare sonnets, and it doesn't feel heavy-handed. (It is only before the camera sees Tadzio all the way out, withdraws and we see his long, slender legs that we realize he is not a boy, but a youth - in the first place we are forced to put Gustav's attraction on an unpleasant way, Visconti must have known it, and he does not depart from it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we get a sense of the man we know him. It's a virtually silent performance, and when he opens his mouth, spitting married is no wonder he wants the English open-minded boy to project himself. There is a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques, but that's because his life is another, his own movie), but it's not as flirtatious as it has been done to work. (There is a scene where he twirls around a pole that is too much). Tadzio does not necessarily lead him to - he looks at him; Visconti just zooming in is everything. <br /> <br /> The film does not describe Gustav as gay - Tadzio is not even real male, he is a prettified version of a boy (delicate, pale, bubbly, with golden locks), who all seem to love (including one beautiful, slightly older young man with whom he is struggling). The closest they go to show what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous shaving scene that releases his oppressed vanity. It is not entirely successful - the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bags in long range, could have been carved. Some parts are heavy hands, as when Gustav's boat enters and wavy boys pass him by - the appearance of his face is too obvious. (But in the same scene, Gustav casts a fit, wants a new rover, something so inexplicable that it does.) But there are some scenes - that touch for the first time - that build a remarkable, quiet intensity. Tadzio repeats a piano song over and over again, the notes shaking in the air may be the best example of the anxiety movie has. There is a discussion that contains a debate I am particularly interested in: Can art be spiritual if it fulfills the senses, or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who respects both Visconti and Mann, to be the primary example of someone going beyond mere sensual sensations.) I think this man can do both. 9.10
