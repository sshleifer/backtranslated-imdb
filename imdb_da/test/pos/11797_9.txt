At more than one level, I can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way. And all I can say about it is that it's true what Dexter's mother tells Eric at the end of history: He actually "healed" his son by removing his sad feelings and loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes a philosophy that I can very much agree with. We will all die one or more times. In the end, it's not the time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have in that time. It's not the crowd, but the quality that counts. I think every other word used here will only keep you from getting to see this movie if you don't already have it. I really want to see it released on DVD. It will definitely be added to my 'all time classics' right away!
