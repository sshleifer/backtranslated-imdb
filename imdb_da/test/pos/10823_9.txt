One comment said it wasn't a comedy ... Error! It was a lovely comedy of a historical period that did not lend itself easily to that genre. Very busy ... and active movie from start to finish. Often the shots were out of the window of the train or the car, just beautiful. An enjoyable way to spend a few hours in a theater. All the French historical figures that Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French resistance were included in the manuscript, which might send those who are not familiar with France's collapse during the German invasion. examine. The characters were engaging and the actors portrayed them were excellent. Recommend it, 9 out of 10.
