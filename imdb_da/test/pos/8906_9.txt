Since the last horrible Astérix movie and the fact that we only get the Swiss German version in cinemas, I went here to see it with a bit of trembling ... The Unfounded, when I was happy to discover ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and modern, has good gags, a good animation, a fun character interaction, a good voice cast (note: I can only speak for the Swiss German!) except for the Viking manager's daughter Abba (her name is great, despite the not very inspired voice of actress) ... I especially liked the characters Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German. He is the young man to be put in shape ...). He is a very entertaining portrayal of a mollycoddled urban teenager; but he is very sympathetic, despite the teenage ways ... XD The interaction between Astérix & Obélix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining. It should not be compared to the old films, as this one is completely different ... Which surprisingly does not make it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last movie (twelve years ago), they blew completely. However, this movie showed that it can be done fine ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater cheerfully ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
