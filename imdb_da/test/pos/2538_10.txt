"Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco" deals with what may be the biggest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is paradoxical and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decline. "Pixote" is one of those films that dares to touch and open these so painful wounds, and does so without the slightest hope of honestly portraying a country already lost to Pixote itself.
