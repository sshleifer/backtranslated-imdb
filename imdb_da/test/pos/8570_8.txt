This must be my guilty pleasure. I am a HUGE fan of the 80s movie that was designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. This movement has no flesh, no substance, no deeply thought-provoking scenes. Just ordinary old college kids have fun, and if some breasts are to appear, then it is! This movie exists when you just want to relax and NOT think. Viva la nudity!
