As you can see, I have submitted 2 comments on this show since 1991 .... and no, ITV has still not made it available for general release. <br /> <br /> I recently contacted ITV to see if there was any way to get a copy and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> " Unfortunately, there are no plans for this program to be released on DVD / Video, but purchase copies from our Viewers Requests Dept. Your email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> Hope you now get the chance to enjoy this classic card comedy again. <br /> <br />
