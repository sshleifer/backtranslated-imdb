Okay, so I've read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling I get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie. That's why I'm writing now - I represent the minority because I did it. I admit I went to watch the movie because I am very impressed with Ryan Gosling's convincing abilities, and the projects he has recently participated in have been nothing short of incredible. He's a great actress. Aside I would watch this movie because it seemed fascinating to me ... why? Because it is a whodunit where you know `whodunit 'from the start and it is a little unusual. When the plot goes, two teenage girls try to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only by committing criminal acts are people really free - the uninhibited, and let us remember, innocent and act out of one's will . The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, indicated by homosexuality, and was brilliantly recorded by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was a manipulative, controlling smooth-talker, and Pitt was the extremely book-smart, socially awkward one. Enter Sandra Bullock's character, as most people don't seem to appreciate. I think when people see that she was the managing producer, they automatically take over any role the actor has in it's self-glorification thing. I didn't see it as the case here. Without "Cassie's" personal story of the former man who nearly killed her, who did not surprisingly share similar traits with Richard Hayward, she would never have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently airtight to Ray, the unsuspecting school guards and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are questioned at the end of the movie, neither Bullock nor her partner has very solid evidence for them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and the vomit Justin left at sight. Therein lies the genius of the movie, because the philosophy that the boys tried to prove through the murder act, the innocent act of will as "true freedom" ended up working against Justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving one part of his conscience on the body dump site). Without the decisive evidence, they almost had a "murder by number." And for readers out there who have puzzled the title as much as I have, I looked into it and found that something done "with numbers" (like a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and demanding. There is also a song by Sting called "Murder By Numbers", but it's next to that point. :) <br /> Many readers questioned the need for the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think it was really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her story. Like that or not, her story plays an important role in this movie, for without it she would probably never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of the clich√© "women despised, woman appearing vendetta in every aspect of her life," but I think without Cassie's depth that you just have another movie about teenage killers and they may just have gotten away with it. There are no movies there. <br /> <br /> And to the reader who commented that teens obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police were on for them from the start, I can recall that the reason was because of the perfectly positioned and fully traceable screenings . The boys wanted to be involved - it was a game. They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand how difficult the researchers would have to uncover what they think is the truth. What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overactive case of instinct that worked on her side. A little incredible? Maybe. But many crimes have been resolved by police officers who have followed their instincts. But this is a movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in theaters about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and I liked it a little more. The more I saw it, the more I was jailed and scared of the psychological depth Richard Hayward-there are people who really like this. My biggest complaint about the movie would be that they should have had Justin and Richard's interactions a little more central (because we make it look like there is intrigue in the whole movie) and my main props go for characterization - each character was very clear and interesting in its own way. It was very well-acted, though I would have given Ben Chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he is a good actor) and perhaps spoiled Bullock's character for a smithy. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock-type thriller like this to tell you "whodunit" at the beginning, it is a very big challenge for the authors to keep the audience's attention in the end. I think they did really well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout, slow revelation of the various character dynamics and by illuminating the screen with some really emotional notions by the young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we might look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the true texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters that were excellently portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm biased. :)
