Well, I'm not a film critic or something like that. But I have my opinion on this movie. I think the best thing about this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her role for my appearance very well, I've seen many her movies, I liked most of it! When you watch this movie, you can just relax, come down and watch it. You don't have to try to search for subtitles or anything like that. You just look at it. Movies are truly amazing. Maybe I liked it for actress, maybe for every landscape, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere was created. In a moment, I just felt like I was at the university in that room. It's not another drama movie made to win Oscar, it's just a good movie to watch at your leisure.
