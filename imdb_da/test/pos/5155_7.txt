The big bell in a bar calls intermittently to last orders and the inevitable rush to two queue forms at the counter ?? Do we want what we only need when it is too late? Or is the irony of the opening scene starving Cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions of the individual existence? There is an endless fascination about where author director Roy Andersson will take us in his fourth move, "You, The Living". With fifty half-related vignettes strung together by a penchant for the tragicomic hyper-reality, its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all together in this great great cosmic cypressic battle. The pure simplicity of this vignette works to dramatize the density and immense dignity of being separated from the symbiotic relationships we have with each other. Andersson could more than the required person's complexity through strong and rapid cynicism more than he should, but he also reminds of the inherent, calming glory of waking up every morning to a new morning when we are all aware of our own distinct forms for arrested development.
