I haven't seen it since 1998 and yet I still can't get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so it shows what an impression it did. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> I just hope to see the stairs at least once in person ... I didn't know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie when I hadn't seen any of his previous works, but his subtle action in this impressed me, and I think his portrayal of Grissom on CSI just shows more of the same. He knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through, making him just as much better for an actor. I can't remember enough about the "bad accents" to comment on, but I have to say that I've always had Barbara Hershey in all her roles too, and I thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie.
