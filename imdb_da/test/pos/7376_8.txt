I originally posted the first user comment on this movie and claimed it was crap and it didn't make sense. I'm not doing SENSE. Campfire stories are a thoroughly enjoyable movie (now I am 2 years older and saw it last night). The actors were famous but not too famous. The action itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I want to judge the film by Segment of film. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA - "The Hook") This one was rather meaningless, it looked good, but didn't keep much grip, the only disappointing thing I didn't think it was was even included as a segment. Here is the scare-o-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) RV Story (Honeymoon Stuck in the Forest) Possibly the most entertaining of all stories, the actor was also good at this and disappointed with the typical caravan sex scenes. Still, it was confusing you think "who knocked on that door". It had excitement and not for gory.Liked this one <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet Chat Speech (Little Girl Meets Psycho) This was a clever addition, making left in minimal, fear left by EXTREME. Although boring at times, the last few minutes were most entertaining, not confusing me , it was still fun to see. Really scary and could happen to anyone, so see who you are talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> 4) Ghost Speech (Man kissing ghost) ?? It wasn't the best, it wasn't too atmospheric for a ghost story. This one was weird, the aspects were pretty good, playing music and screaming, but everything was too real to be terrible, although it was good, it was quiet, bloody and could have been better with that idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) Ending (the 4 lost teenagers) These are the two attractive gals and guys, who tells the stories through the film. The best thing about the movie is the final end, it was a good impression, the end was completely unexpected. See it, it was so well done, the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) <br / > <br /> 6) MOVIE OVERALL Campfire stories were more than I used to do, I really like it so much now that I buy it on video because it is a really entertaining horror movie forgetting the garbage bin you see these days Like many, I'm disappointed that this didn't really go anywhere, it was just for video, for me it was better than any hype "ho rror" you see these days. Overall for Campfire Tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very good) <br /> < br /> 8 out of 10
