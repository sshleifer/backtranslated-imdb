If you listen to the Ween (Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's going on with "Split" I found out to watch the movie under the influence of LSD helped handle audio / video trackers from a great editing job. The reason was only important from second to second. The acid helped to interact with sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't write about anything out of the reach of your understanding. There are just not enough of these great independent attempts at the most raw, amateur level. I dare anyone to make a movie that can just as well touch my head and change the way I look at visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human mind. I love the vision of Chris Shaw. I also appreciate the texturing terror film "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
