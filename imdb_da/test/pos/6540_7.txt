When this film is featured, the discussion usually begins with the wonderful collection of cars and often-overlooked scenes, which are sometimes eclectic characters that fill the film around the three key characters. <br /> <br /> A sign that stands out is the Rebel played by the great veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind driver running almost in the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he doesn't use any headlights. <br /> <br /> In the back story, we find that Rebel street builder car builds and he and his wife seem to be locked in a 1950s time chain. Rebel continues to play a small but crucial role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth of street drag racing. It's not speed, reaction times that make a good racer. It is the one who feels the car best, which will be the greatest <br /> <br /> This is best exemplified as Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive "You have all the pain, just missing the style" <br /> <br / > Graham Bond is another well-credited actor who lends his talents as a curly policeman who seeks to address some of the economic actions generated by the street competition. The confrontation between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds tension to the story. Bond not only expects results but also Fox for drum in racing business <br /> <br /> Most of the movie Fox shows a real manipulative and evil side, but in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the last few minutes in an extremely exciting and memorable ending. It is almost as if the film focuses on its true intention, to show us the culture of street competitions rather than the activities of daily life. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest complaints about the movie is the script. Although it's not exciting, I believe in the complete lack of chemistry between Mike's boyfriend, played by Deborah Conway, and his mechanic, who plays Vangelis Mouriki's, has more to do with the problem. Any scene where these two interacts simply should have been cut <br /> <br /> Finally, with regard to the actors, a true standby performance is provided by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and stubborn member of Fox's inner circle. His gut history has never been explored, he was wounded in a race, born that way, what is it that Fox sees worth keeping him around <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it's about street racing and the culture behind it. When cars fly and action sequences are underway, it's the only time director John Clark and his author Barry Tomblin seem to be really comfortable with what they're doing. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for in-depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life define drama, then this movie is not for you. If your heart rate runs at the thought of a blown 57 Chev or the iconic GTO Phase 3 blazing away on Sydney's streets, you won't find much better than this movie
