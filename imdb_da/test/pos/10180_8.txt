Looking at the animated Superman shorts from the 1940s, the similarity of equality can become a bit boring - the opponent is usually a mad scientist in a hidden headquarters threatening metropolis with a vicious invention - rays of death, mechanical monsters, earthquakes, magnetic telescopes, what Do you have. <br /> <br /> This is refreshingly different. The bad are driving around in a car, shooter and bombs, but the mall is the golden train (as Lois Lane travels as the only press reporter). Train films have their own typical ingredients, from 1903 Great Train Robbery on, and some are here: Decoupling of moving cars, running on the roof, taking the steam lid from the tender in the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned to the deroute train on a side trace, fallen (by people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... that's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece. <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't be a Superman movie if he didn't do some fantastic feats (involving balance and high precision placement) for eventually winning the day. If you're a fan of train movies, don't miss out on this. It is publicly available and can be downloaded legally from archive.org.
