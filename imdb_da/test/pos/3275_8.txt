Okay, maybe Posse can't be compared to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FINANCING they were filming. Of course, when you want to produce a story like this that focuses on African American historical involvement (and no, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood won't be too supportive. And believe me, they weren't. The producers and players sacrificed many "out of pocket" expenses to make "Posse" just for the story to be told. I think it alone is legitimate. Posse may not be an Oscar (and they may not like Black Media), but it's a start. It's entertaining, and it introduces us to the black cowboy, a sign most of us are not familiar with.
