If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely fun. From teens wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and breaking dancing on the side to jokes about car airbags and waitresses in total shock to a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, "Yes, that's right." It is very fun if you also understand Russian because the subtitles just don't always do it justice. The actors are so credible and Elijah Wood does a good job of playing a socially unlucky Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "seeing eye dog", which is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and sympathetic that you think they are real people.
