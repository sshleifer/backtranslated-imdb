The people who don't like this movie seem to have some academic vendetta against it - those of us who don't keep the original can totally enjoy it. My husband who had never seen the original said "I don't want to see a nice movie." I assured him that "the women" are just a good movie, not a girl movie. He had a good time. He was very happy to have gone and enjoyed it more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burn after reading." <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think the new end is better. Maybe not so much fun, but it was beautiful. First, I couldn't understand why they had made some changes to the plot <br /> <br /> but when I got the end and Debra Messing was born and brought the first man into the movie, I shouted. It's a thing to love about men ?? they are our sons.
