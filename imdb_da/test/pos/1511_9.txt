"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences knit together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director Lucio Fulc's most notorious year of film making. The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of the kind that effectively spoofing the various allegations that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes beyond what he throws himself as a star, thus the film's central figure shows the audience, who is the man behind the whole cinematic gore. "Cat in the Brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, it jokes fun at some of the cliches that have been surrounded by the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent film production have finally begun to reach him. It starts slowly, steaks and meat generally start to wake him, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is some rest. But it does not help, and soon the grotesque ideas for his film begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously biliary mental state, Lucio begins to go to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it does more wrong than good, and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychologist turns out to be a psychopath that mimics the murders of Fulci's real-life film. <br /> <br /> The movie preserves all the trademarks of Italian splatter cinema, good or bad, they are all here. So any comment on the play or technical aspects and budget constraints is quite irrelevant in terms of the quality of the movie. It's a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence that easily surpasses almost everything he has done. Amputated by chainsaw limbs, cannibalism, child murder, decapitation, these are just some of the many grotesque actions that witness "Cat In The Brain". Some of them are, of course, recycled from a few director's smaller profile films, but they are not out of context and really feel at home here. As I noted, the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece. The way in which part of the violence is presented helps to establish this idea. Such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality of the movie as they are revealed to be scenes in a movie that Fulci's character controls. This kind of "movie in film" presentation somewhat reduces the effect of gore. But in no way makes it easy to watch movies. Oh no this is far beyond the levels of gore found in mainstream horror, and gorehounds will no doubt be satisfied with that fact. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate their work or love it. "Cat in the Brain" will not convince any of the Fulci's detractors in the opposite, but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography. One who fans should really check out.
