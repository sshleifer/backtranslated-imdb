What often threatens to turn into a mushy and soft spectacle of misunderstood middle-class youth ends with a surprisingly shady and subdued film by John Frankenheimer (his first, even though he had started on television, among other things, ran an earlier version of this script ). <br /> <br /> We're still in the semi-mythical 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees. James MacArthur (adoptive son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later into pop culture such as Hawaii 5-0's Danno) gets involved in a minor event in a movie theater that escalates to a blow on the manager (Whit Bissell) and becomes booked down at the police station. His father (James Daly), a big-shot movie producer gets the call, does not listen to his son's version of the story and pulls strings to free him. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mother (Kim Hunter) can't beat. Things worsen in the Coldwater Canyon home until MacArthur tries to assert himself, confirming a rendition of the original event. <br /> <br /> The movie does not completely avoid the attitudes ?? and clich√©s ?? of his time, but presenting them with great nuance: Each character gets a decent hearing; any point of view has its advantages (and the reactions to the film will depend on what the viewers bring it to). There are errors (the word "curvature", a standard rebellious euphemism in the era, used about 30 times too often), but they are outweighed by forces. The film benefits from a strong cast (most notable among them the outstanding character actor James Gregory, as a police specialist) and a resolutely non-exploitative way of telling his story. From a vantage point in the new millennium, the warm waters of MacArthur may seem a little weak, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honest. <br /> <br />
