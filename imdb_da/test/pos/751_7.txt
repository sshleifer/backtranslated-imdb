The low budget but memorable would be choker, which instead appears as bizarre theater. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a remote mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered, despite the red flags constantly being raised around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers a little more to go beyond a sense of style as well as a casting of crazy characters. The pleasures of this movie do not come from the movie's shock, which is rather tame, but from the weird atmosphere. First, we have the errant woman who thinks her baby doll is genuine. There is also an ax-killing judge, a shaky war veteran, and the old wife Callahan is like everyone's daffy older mother who has gone crazy. A young patient named Allyson gives the term "nymphomaniac" new meaning. A big guy named Sam is just a little slow after a bleached lobotomy, and Jennifer suddenly chooses between catatony and violent outbreaks. The only other sensitive person on the site seems to be Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Don't look at the basement" is a good example of low budget exploitation films. There is not much plot going on, but the cheap works for the movie. More role players turn into memorable performances, especially Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and how the instructor adds some weird details to the movie can really stick to you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and the "phone man" is a classic of all time, and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when she begins to cross the edge near the film's finale. Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack, with several musical signals that really evoke the characters they accompany. My favorite queue is the "crazy" cue, a sitar that twangs when one of the patients does something pathological. <br /> <br /> Also wonderful is the way Charlotte herself tumbles into the hysteria of the climax, where the patients reveal that Dr. Masters is simply another effort, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient allowed to act out of his delusions (she certainly has a grisly grip on reality, why else would she not question the monstrous lack of phone service or outside contact?). The scene where Charlotte manages to finish the life-long Dr. Stephens with a toy boat should be one of the greatest moments in the low budget horror. Yes, "Don't look in the basement" might well be the "American beauty" in Class Z waste.
