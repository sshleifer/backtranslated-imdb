I had never seen a movie by John Cassavetes until two years ago when I first saw the DREAD OF A BUY BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema that I found interesting to say diplomatically, but not so specially, I immediately wanted to See more of his work. Since then I tried - with emphasis on tried - to see his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I have to admit it took me a while before I actually enjoyed the movie. First, the unpolished, raw and improvised way of Cassavete's shot was averted, and I thought of it as an original - absolute - but erroneous and dated experiment. But now, these small imperfections assess that they look so fresh today. <br /> <br /> Minimizing $ 40,000 with a six-person crew skeleton, SHADOWS gives an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family, where two of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) are light-skinned and can pass for white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their proper names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group, but saw the film as concerned about human problems as opposed to racial. Cassavetes shot the film about ten minutes of time and crooked editing, a response to 'seamless' Hollywood production values. Cassava's main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style was the film shot - were the Italian neo-realists while admiring admiration for Welles' groundbreaking spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation may look like some of the Italian neo-realistic directors, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus's Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike what has been done before. <br /> <br /> The song with the feathered girls, "I like a lolly pop" (or something) feels like bright years back to me, old story. But no matter how dated it looks, it still makes a nice time capsule of late Fifties New York today. I think this is one of the first films that made aspiring filmmakers to shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims that it was Jules Dassin's NAKED CITY (1948), who was the first to inspire them all, but I think this was the one who really opened his eyes to hope independent American filmmakers. br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
