To be honest colleagues IMDb reviewers, I enjoyed this show a lot. The reason? Well, it wasn't trying to be more than it is; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a familiar and repetitive plot, fun and talented actors and clever jokes that are oriented to a post-college audience. <br /> <br /> It's about Grown Ups about: trying to be mature but in a fun way. Jaleel White is fun as always and delivers some witty and fun sex-oriented jokes. The humor is much the 90s without taking into account trends in the new millennium, and that is the main reason for my opinion why the show was unsuccessful. It got stuck in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Oh and Mrs Ribisi was really fun and perky. My favorite show must be the one dealing with karma that bites the robbed! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of the regular early 2000 nostalgia.
