Has the spread of relatively high quality offerings on the diffusing television networks made it possible for people to produce, directly, finance and / or star in their own films that otherwise would not have been able to? Is that a good thing? <br /> <br /> This movie does not respond to the latter question in any way, but it seems that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to get me to have someone to eat cheese with. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece raises a much more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb). And yet it's a sensitive movie? He's not really a sensitive guy. Probably, sure. Relatable, actually. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is a little hard to say, I can only relate to what I took away from it. <br /> <br /> I rented the movie because of trailers, especially the stage of an adviser depicted by Amy Sedaris, and informed James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him, mainly because she is a "chubby chaser". "I almost fell out of my seat. Based on that scene alone, I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. The reason - I thought the school's counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, depicted by Sarah Silverman I imagined a bright romantic comedy between foxy Silverman and the cool Garlin, I didn't think the story would be original, but the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move together at a satisfactory pace. , it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was exciting that the movie started that way, but then took a much more realistic turn when Beth gives James the heave ho because "I've never been to a fat guy before. "It's so brutal we live life and it was quite realistic. I welcome the decision. It just meant that Beth has now left the building and with her, the one cunning person in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jacob's relationship with his mother was also interesting. That part made me wonder if the whole concept didn't start as a game. It had the intricate feeling of it. (The whole "Marty" movie within a movie thing was completely lost to me when I never saw that movie.) There was serious doubt that James Aaron had character. Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And he's an actor? It wasn't really square with me. For me, his persona was less actor-y and more corporate. I also couldn't buy his regular. There was no doubt he was very disappointed that things with Beth didn't work. We felt that. But then does he really bother? <br /> <br /> Another thing - how in the world can he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? Didn't he just lose his job? The last one he had? It was a reason that he did not seem common to me. Where does the funding come from for his life? <br /> <br /> And yet, I've read reviews that talk about the realistic depiction of the city's loneliness, so that's it. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we should be happy with what we have, because that is all we have. The way we disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella), a form of self-extinction that takes place just to move on to the next moment. That, unlike the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts as James had with Beth, it is truly crushing. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
