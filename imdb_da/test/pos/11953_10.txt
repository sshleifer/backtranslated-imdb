I really love something done by Savage Steve Holland, the author / director of this amazing movie. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I Got In College." Wonderful! Anyway this movie is really humorous and provides some unexpected things. Where else but in this movie can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend this to anyone looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the turtle), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times as I have! Enjoy!
