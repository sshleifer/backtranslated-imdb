The first half hour of "Homegrown" was a bit boring and not absorbent, but when the film progressed, it also made my interest in the characters and plot. Several scenes are really scary and you are scared of the main characters that you actually get attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in Southern California. They testify to the murder of the farm owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take over the weeds for their own. The three rather simple farm hands are quickly celebrated in a frightening world of mafia and local interest, while constantly trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several errors and a slow start, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars.
