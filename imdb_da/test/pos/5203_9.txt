This movie shocked me. It was so realistic, and the story was incredibly moving. They speak German and Russian, making it more credible and real. This is a must-see movie. The actors are also good. Really a good job. The plot takes place within a German troop in World War II. They are going to Stalingrad, the Soviet, to fight against Soviet armies. You become more connected to each soldier in this group and follow them through all the dangers they are caught in Stalingrad. They face face to face with death, blood, grief and the cold in Russia. This is a must-see movie and you can't afford not to see it.
