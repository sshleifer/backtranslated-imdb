RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. The play, script, continuity, et cetera are all almost perfect; And the story is worth the viewer 82 minutes. Although flower clips are the true life story by making the murder sacrifice a Jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguise never works, perhaps it wasn't supposed to. <br /> <br /> I could nit-pick about a few details, but just for fun. There was no nightlife in Washington DC in 1947 --- and if desired, Robert Mitchum and his friend would not talk through the show. There were no bars where a GI could pick up a beautiful blonde. NONE! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest assassination, he should have bought the Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, the Evening Star and certainly not the Washington Post. But these little things do not take anything away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The movie benefits greatly from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the credits. I've only seen this done in a couple of movies. On the negative side, since 1995, a TMC introduction has come, with some liberal blabs about what the public was ready in 1947.. blah blah blah! As if this stupid has any business to judge his players. I would say that the ex-GIs in 1947 - the largest generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than some commentator, movie historian or other vismund in 1995. Put a sock on it!
