This film has two new features in relation to the communication conveyed by other equally good films about the death penalty and executions. It is also stressed by the drama exercised by the victims' parents - without disguising the hatred and affection they feel or diminishing the horror that the execution represents - and the Christian vision of all the implicit issues. We must also point out that in this movie, the convicted man is not the usual, innocent person we see in other films dealing with executions that do not lead us to abandon the idea that a sentence is no more than one legal murder anyway. Last but not least, we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution of all the catharsis shown by the sentenced last words and the details by which the action of the action itself is seen in a parallel section with images of The murder scenes in the forest emphasize that we are confronted with another murder as indecent as the latter, but carried out in a cold and presumably "legal" way.
