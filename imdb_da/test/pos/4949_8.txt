Iron Eagle may not be the most credible movie plot-wise, but the characters are well-written and highly-featured. If you can't believe the characters, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I think the photography, especially the aerial photography, is amazing. I think it is far better than Top Gun as it is infinitely compared to. It's one of the best pieces of aerial photography I've seen. The sound track at Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is fantastic and sits well with rock music. I want that part of the soundtrack available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as a teenager, who must suddenly grow up in a rush and the reality of life, death and responsibility. Lou Gossett is fabulous as Chappy, both hard-bitten and yet human, recalling the deaths of the pilots. <br /> <br /> There are lots of movies out there that you see once and don't care to see again. Then there are the movies that make you one aspect or another and you can see it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
