I was 19 years old when I first saw this movie in the theater. I have a living memory of another end. Not quite different but significant. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong so I think the following can't be called a spoiler, as it never happened. The one I remember was that the boy hid in the house quite naked, Frances Austen found him pretty easy, and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to his knees and walked down on him by the camera. Only his face was in the frame, and it was quite obvious that he let it happen, albeit against his will. But nothing like this appeared in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie, Michael Burns was 22. In the film, he complains to his sister that Frances is making too much sex. Yes? Well, go to bed with her guy and take it over. WTF?
