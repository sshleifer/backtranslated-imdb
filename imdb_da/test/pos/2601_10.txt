Once again Elmer faces the dilemma of who should shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He is unsure of which season it is, and Bunny and Duck do not argue for help. Though Bugs turn out, he is the smartest again by repeatedly using reverse psychology at Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when it runs out, he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and requires the rabbit to be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the girls' bunny stuff. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he wasn't that stupid, he would know it really is the duck season and just blow up Daffy. But poor old Daff cannot believe in the complete sense of the situation. His cruel misdirection plans have been confused by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so shocked that he himself goes home with Elmer to be blown in his living room. Bad daff. He rules!
