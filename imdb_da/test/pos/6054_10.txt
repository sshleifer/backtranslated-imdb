I would buy this and "Thirty Seconds Over Toyko" today, if available. I also watched this movie after seeing big billboards by Jack Webb in his Dress Blues on the highway at the age of 12. Always admired Jack Weeb as a John Wayne type and American all the way. Almost became a Marine just because of this movie, but instead served in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve for 32 years. Have not seen this movie on TV at all and would love to own it on DVD. At least if it was on TV, I would copy it to VHS and use it until it was available on DVD. I also have a large collection of World War II and Korean war films and always look for new releases on DVD.
