this show is the best it is full of laughs and Kevin James is the best, so if you want a good show, I recommend the king's queens and it is a letdown that they canceled, so in the end this show Make you forget your worries and problems cause, if you have a throw with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller, you can't go wrong. so I don't know why canceled the show if anyone knows, so tell me. Now you can't find many shows that meet your needs as the audience. After Seinfeld and King of Queens, the only show worth seeing is prison break and if that stops, I don't know what to do. In the end, if I had to recommend a show, it would be King of Queens.
