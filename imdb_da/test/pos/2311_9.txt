This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been out on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of humor as well as recognize much of the nearby landscape (the film, although it took place in and around Virginia, was filmed around San Francisco Bay), especially the mothball fleet just east for the Benicia Bridge, where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray and San Francisco pier at the end of the movie (including a boat I worked on). As others have said, the actors seemed to have fun making this movie and making it entertaining. The line "We are approaching the bottom, gentleman! I can hear a few lobsters pop it out" is at least for me priceless. I am one of many people who are eagerly awaiting a letterboxed DVD of Down Periscope to be introduced.
