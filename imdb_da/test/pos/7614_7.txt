Never been kissed, Drew Barrymore gives the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. In fact, the first time for me was bad enough and I doubt I could pull it out the way Drew does. <br /> <br /> Of course, when we leave high school, it might be like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the big big unfriendly world out there. I have known a couple in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact, there is a law and order episode that explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl who looks young enough to pull it out, goes through high school at least three times and kills the person stumbling on her secret. <br /> <br /> Although Drew is a task. She is a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times, who yearns to be a reporter. Publisher Garry Marshall, who plays the role of Donald Trump took over the Sun Times, gets this brilliant idea and just sees in Barrymore a young enough looking person out of the masquerade. <br /> <br /> The first time High School was bad enough. Drew wasn't the most popular then, and she can't do better the second time. That is, until Brother David Arquette also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many problems for Drew, peer pressure from two sources, jobs and school. What is a girl to do? <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is a light and charming comedy that, by credit, skips the possibility of being spooky and giving us good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet, and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into the pathos. Michael Vartan, as her English teacher, is the kind I would like more in the field of education, and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a couple of the empty-headed cool kids that Drew is trying to hang out with. <br /> <br /> Still, it doesn't inspire me to return to Midwood High School.
