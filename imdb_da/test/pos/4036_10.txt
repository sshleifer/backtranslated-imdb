I thought the story came in very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you go on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently it doesn't believe anyone. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD to my room. That's how much I like it. I'd rather not start an online argument with someone I don't know and have over a movie. If anyone could kindly withdraw what they said about the story, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. But if they feel that I am not inclined to retreat, I can only feel that they are not worthy. But I cannot control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hi, they don't have to retire, but I would very much appreciate that.
