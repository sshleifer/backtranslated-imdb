Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's existing bestseller, was dismissed by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 and sounded a setback to musicals in general, giving the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of disparate British and American individuals end up in an emergency out of a war-torn Asian country, but their aircraft are hijacked and crashed into a snow-covered mountain area; a rescue party arrives and heads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining, and most of the residents are youthful and happy content. Some of the performances in the stylish cast are not so classic (the roaring mood of the play, the lilting Burt Bacharach-Hal David melodies, and the easy-going all breakdown to make the artists look a little stupid). Peter Finch is the international peacekeeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a malcontent that spits out lines like: "I was tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown away, so people with their heads continue - and usually under hairdryers - could get a final kick before turning to the latest recipe "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned to speak English while attending Oxford, is humorously self-satisfied (but why no songs to Chang?). Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes staggering ("On the Good Ship Lollipop / how did Christopher Columbus / sail across the sea?") And the pacification is rooted in everything that is spoken about the outside world and how nothing is more miserable today. However, the production is lush and the general handling seems odd. The two-dimensional characters are all too serious that they actually grow, and the film's misery is contagious. It ends up being very fun. *** from ****
