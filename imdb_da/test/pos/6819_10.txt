I saw these short moments ago on the Sundance Film Festival website and I have to say it is absolutely amazing. I was expecting to be entertaining - like all Sundance shorts - but I wasn't prepared for such deep sadness yet any sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen any of this year's contribution to the festival, I suggest you go to the site and look at these mini-masterpieces - I've seen them all and can honestly say 'The Youth in us' the one who has touched my heart the most. I'm not the weakest audience when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes flooded so much, I'm surprised I could still see the screen. I agree with 'addicted2you' it really is a masterful piece of directorial work, and cinematography will just take the breath away. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a better way to spend an extra 12 minutes.
