This British film version of the scene game I AM A CAMERA is based on Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin stories". This is the source material for the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, a city actress in her day, represents her 1951 Tony Award winning role as Sally Bowles. She is far from the Liza Minnelli character, but the basic "Sally" is here all despite the various movie codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in Hollywood. Harris is perhaps stagy, but she is also pretty good as madcap and madman Sally. Her song number is, of course, called (by Marlene Dietrich no less), although Harris apparently sings for himself in other moments. Laurence Harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero charm and cannot even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters does a little with Natalia's role (Marian Winters won a supporting Tony for the game) and Anton Diffring is OK as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the caddish Clive, but seems a bit loud. Lee Seidl is fun as the landlady. <br /> <br /> Despite the overall staginess and cheap look, Harris takes the center and she is amazing. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN, where Harris gives a glowing performance like Abra. Comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent Miss Harris possesses. These two characters could not be more odd. Harris' Sally preens and prances about and laughs out a very awesome laugh. She also trades circles around the boring Harvey. Without the music and with a well-known story, many viewers can find little here to recommend this movie, but it's a good chance to see the great Julie Harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.
