I saw Five Fingers at Drive-In in ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I had ever seen and I was very entertained. I recently bought it on DVD and saw it again. I was also very much entertained for the second time. I think it's probably the most Kung-Fu movie modeled for. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. They even threw in the Japanese (very bad guys) styles of karate and judo. I remember being entertained by the Dublinian dialogue, like "Hey You! You're a very bad guy!" and "they shouldn't get rid of this! I want to go in this bad crowd!" This time it wasn't so distracting, I think I'm used to it. If you even have the least appreciation of this genre, this is one you should see.
