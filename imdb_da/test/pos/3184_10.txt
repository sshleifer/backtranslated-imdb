There is only so much that I can take Filipino movies, especially today where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy (which I hate). The fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape under the film was a big plus. It has good movie pictures and editing was great, especially the movie cabinet. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here instead of getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there are so few Filipino movies that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a good job in this movie. I really really loved this movie, technical and character development wise; The reason was complex and that was what made it great.
