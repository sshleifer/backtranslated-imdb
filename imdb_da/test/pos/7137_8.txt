Based on a true story . . . <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is to illustrate that through fairly normal events, an outwardly "decent" mother can be drawn into heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** semi spoiler *** Some of the scenes are pretty inaccurate - while others almost make you get the 'fix' themselves. <br /> <br /> Computer technician / graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teenage spirals in addiction after work colleague, who is a 'chipper' (-which can take + enjoy it now and again -) So spiral in an addiction that eventually leads her to score off 'street dealers' after losing contact with her regular dealer. <the scenes showing her coming down and becoming 'sick' are often very real - especially the first real 'night sweat'. Before all these events, she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle and insists he has an inner radar so as not to be mocked by such women. Some radar! However, her boyfriend challenges some delays and strange behavior to her. His radar starts to get more with it and demands that she empty her bag; she hits the ceiling and storms. Because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy, he is the first to "find" some true evidence in his bag; He then looks around the snake for her "stash" - apparently his sensitivity from schooling to drug withdrawal - and when he discovers a big stash in the bathroom he flushes it! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and it is 'gone'. The child holds one back and places it on the dining table - she then goes into further denial - admits it and says it no worse than dope. This kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' - if you want to apologize for the pun. <br / <br /> The movie takes viewers through some rather difficult situations where danger is not far away. Eventaully gets her help from a professional organization and cold turkey - you'll have to watch movies to see what happens next time. . . .
