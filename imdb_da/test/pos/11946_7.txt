I love this movie as much as anyone loves to see what it was they saw when they were young. It was one of the movies that the Home Box Office showed every other day throughout my youth. This film is forever filed in my brain. For someone who did not grow up around this movie, you may have been spoiled by the ADD cycle we have been in since the mid-90s and it may be harder to appreciate this gem. this is when my sis was baptized on "better death" before I saw this (as I raped and loved) - and no one can deny the embrace of awkward teen humor in the American cinema in the 80s - this has born all we have found tiresome in teenage comedies .. because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS the teenage comedy ... YES!
