It should be noted that this movie was not "improvised" (as you probably think of it), despite what the title at the end suggests. The film was heavily written and repeated - Cassavetes did not have enough money to support the inevitably high production costs of an "improvisational" kind of film, even though he had wanted to produce such a thing. The "improvisation" of the film is contained in the actors' notions and the feelings they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let me say that this is a great job, as I 'am sure I will come back to again and again. The depth of emotions that Cassavetes is able to pull out of the smallest movements and interactions is incredible. I have no idea how he was able to lead such amazing performances out of the actors, especially under the circumstances he worked. This is truly a magnificent landmark of movies that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the Hollywood style.
