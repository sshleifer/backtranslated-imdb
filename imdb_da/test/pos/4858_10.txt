The essential message - which Miller would have intended after seeing the Vichy war crime attempt - is that hatred for someone without a rational reason is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes, by the budget of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target group". For me, this is the crucial message - it is no matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this time forward - they are marked and have the ability to save themselves by reason. The animal's aggression and anger have blinded Fred's Union bullies to reality. One of my friends suggested that I see "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without realizing it. I once conducted an role-playing experiment and was shocked to see how normal and leveled people welcomed the creation of a repressive police state - which ultimately threatens them all - because it crept into stages. <Br /> <br /> Peace is the start, his LA friends and preacher idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors over the edge of violence without stopping to believe what they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein is a fascinating Jewish shopkeeper because Lawrence misses the point almost to the end: if bigots crash Finkelstein, where does he go? If his family has fled the Nazis, what irony will be plagued again in the country "freedom". <br /> <br /> The great poster (it's a pretty famous propaganda piece) about American families enjoying the highest standards of Living in the World is a very important detail. When you watch this movie, look for graffiti at the metro station and all the small posters. The message also lurks there. <br /> <br /> This film should be on the curriculum of each school, especially in our time when basal hatred is being promoted so widely by "reasonable" people who are only extremist in thin aprons.
