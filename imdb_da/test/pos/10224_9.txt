I wish there was a category to place this in anything other than Horror. It's simply not. Granted it has horrible moments, but I don't feel it makes it a horror movie. I want to say that this movie could have been better. A million small things could have been changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> Having been told, I love this movie. I am often sorry that people misunderstand the whole point of it. It has always been clear to me that the meaning of this movie was to say ... things are not always what they think. Sometimes evil is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was on a Con, I went to, and he made a little talk, then watch the movie's stuff. It was very interesting. Many things he wanted to put into the movie couldn't be, and a lump was cut out of the movie, which he thought was long lost. This was a lump that helped to shed light on Boone and his girlfriend as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know some people are bothered by having no more information on all the "races" in the background, but I have always felt what gave the film a more "real" feeling out. I have read the short story, which was based on many of the comics. Because of this, the film always seemed to be a platform for the whole story. A much more involved story that unfortunately never has a chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, this movie may have I think it has a lot to offer. "Monsters" are wonderful, very imaginative. While the play is sometimes a bit stiff, there are some very citable lines. When I see it, I find something new. Watch the Boones chest towards the end. At one point Decker sticks him and shortly after Boone falls on a card table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a while, even after Lori pulls the knife out. It stays there until Boone unfortunately removes it. I love it. It was a nice little detail I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically, what I want to say is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, don't see this. If you think that sometimes men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed of. This is the movie for you. This is a film about how men destroy what they do not understand or fear.
