First of all, I must say I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly, and it is one of the movies that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that the girls who kill themselves are the ones you don't notice. This fact made me wonder because that is why she commits suicide in the movie. The director impressed me with it and made a movie showing the plot to the audience and also delivering the message that not many people would have seen it coming. Some people may start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it, but no one noticed her like no one saw the movie either ... Don't know about you, but I guess it wouldn't Be her who committed suicide. Do you have? <br /> <br /> Regards Jan
