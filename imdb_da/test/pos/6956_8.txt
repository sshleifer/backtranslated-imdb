Director Jay Craven's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's 'Where the Rivers Flow North' is one of the finer transitions from literature to screen. Craven admires Mosher's work - he also instructed 'A stranger in the kingdom'. <br /> <br /> Casting is great - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers what could be his finest role - Noel Lord, the extremely independent former carpenter who is at the heart of this story. The Tantoo Cardinal's portrayal of the Lord's living in housekeeper / common-law wife is also dead. I am both surprised and disappointed that none of them were nominated for Oscars when this film was released. Performances of this caliber should be recognized. The only sign that is a little hard to swallow for me is the power company performed by Michael J. Fox. He just looks too much like a child in this role. I think there is a curse for youthful looks, no matter how much people want them. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a great job here to bring the character of the early 20th century Vermont to the screen - places, angles, sets, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story . Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. The result of horse racing is also the first movement - it fits perfectly with the mood and stage. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling portrayals of the highly independent American pioneer spirit ever to be a move in this day and age. When it appears in modern times, the person is often looked at with suspicion and contempt. In Noel Lord we have a character that we can admire for his values ​​and even for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a stodgy 'period piece' but a pulsating look at an era that is gone and a type of character that has everything but disappeared. These are not gilded heroes, but real people, with both strengths and weaknesses in games in them. struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world they live in. Like today, there are those who do power that would otherwise have it.
