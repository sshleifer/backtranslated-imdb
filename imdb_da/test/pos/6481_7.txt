I watched the movie about 13 years ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I had found it in the shelves of a small store in the back that most didn't bother to browse. <br /> <br /> For my pleasure, I found it and saw it one day to own it and be in my collection. I still don't have it, but will one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept of poetry and imagination. The semi-damaged street scenes with a busy team city in the distant background added the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have repeatedly mentioned this movie to people who enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. It has stuck in my mind and will come for a long time. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie, but only to those of this type. This comment and the one from LA, CA can help you when you choose to watch this movie. The comments may be negative, but I found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.
