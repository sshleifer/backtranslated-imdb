Well, how can I categorize Farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives? Okay, here goes! The scripts are amazing, with every episode of so much entertainment, drama, humor and pure surveillance. The casting is perfect, especially for Zhaan (the blue lady) played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that just isn't there on the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think having an Australian spin on the show makes it to me, Australia has turned out quality movies for years, and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I have only seen the first four episodes in UK order and they have a quality that makes every 45 Minute Shows (in the UK) stand out more like a movie than a weekly television series. <br /> <br /> The episode that really does it for me is 'I, ET' that makes the alien concept around where Moya (a living ship, even the spacecraft has a big character) is forced to land on a planet that has not yet made 'First Contact' and is surprising land like, and Crichton meets a radio telescope operator and * he * is the little green man 'to them. Grabbing things. In short, the effects are good, the scripts are of the highest quality, and the protagonists (not one of them really gets more importance than anyone else) are interesting, not always good and well just excellent. <br /> <br /> Scroll the second season!
