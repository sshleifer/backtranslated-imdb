This is a story of a journey made by a man who once had a dream and gut. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, world-world yacht race. <br /> <br /> I was very fascinated by the story after listening to a radio interview from producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of "Touching the Void", one of the first documentaries to do a commercial success in 2003. I was in the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge of historical event, and I am relieved that it did not let me down. For 92 minutes I was led through a ghost story and came out with much to think about. <br /> <br /> Without resumption, this movie greatly benefited from the limited audio and video archive footage they found and put on a compelling story that allowed audiences to understand Crowhurst from a personal level. The story revealed itself as people who had direct connections to the events, including his wife and his son, and the final winner, also the only one who made it back from the 9 competitors, gave Robin Knox-Johnston their own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago. Crowhurst's logs, which he kept during the 243 days at sea, are so exciting that it made it much easier for me to understand what total isolation can do to a man. While Crowhurst's body was never found, the second competitor Nigel Tetley, whose hunt just sank weeks before claiming the fastest passenger price, was committed suicide three years later after unsuccessful attempts to properly conduct a detour. <br /> <br /> Everything could take its toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> Director Louise Osmond was also at the Q&A session after the show along with producer John Smithson. I had no idea it was a female instructor, and it just came as a very nice surprise. The movie gets a limited release in the UK (a few days in certain cinemas). Capture it at the cinema when you can, unless you have a modern sound system that can restore the sound of the Southern Ocean. I'm sure they'll get it on DVDs soon.
