Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about, Well, Dolemite and his army of Kung Fu Killer women, led by Queen Bee. He struggles to get his club, The Total Experience, back from Willie Green by taking advantage of their kung fu skills and their devotion to him. I liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach to his brothers in the rhyme.
