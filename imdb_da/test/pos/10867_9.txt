This movie gives Daniel Wu his chance to make a great action movie, but I really find Emil Chows character really big, gutsy but determined to fix mistakes. Plus, the main terrorist, it makes me wonder about his revolution, makes me wonder if he's doing good or bad. <br /> <br /> A movie telling us about Todd that an amnesiac terrorist is being deceived as an undercover until he learns who he really is. The consequences that he creates from his family of terrorists give him the choice of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The movie really stands out when it is filled with huge action scenes created by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action sequences in the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
