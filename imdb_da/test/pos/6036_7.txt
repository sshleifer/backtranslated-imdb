My first 'Columbo'. Instead, enjoy it. Big format, and Peter Falks character extremely good ... wonderfully quirky, he can sit next to Poirot, Miss Marple and also Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has the following. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who only produces these pedestrian performances for the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never get a house like that or such fame or cars, much less called a genius. And the actor that the actor does is so bad to be ridiculous. No orchestra would take him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also several small things, such as. his practice of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why does it repeat when they have just done it for television? Any orchestral musician could play it in his or her sleep anyway ...). His instructions to the ensemble are rather nonsensical, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what 'quasi fantasia' means, she says it's 'Latin'. It is Italian, like the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, no two good musicians will ever have the following exchange: "Play something." "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their job and passion, they know it well. Something more specifically will be asked and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should come out more ...
