Just looked at hair after 20 years. It hit home. For those of us who tried to stand on the citizens of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; opposed to fascism at the Johnson / Nixon administrations; as now civil warlords, the war in Vietnam fought every day until finally the American game died and fled; For anyone who said no in many different ways - it is remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How big the right table was, where Treat danced. How did the guide run behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We didn't know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that for the next thirty years and counts would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with smoke and bats (bat!) In our hand, like Treat, we were too young for middle class too invested, too much of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory observes in my dinner with. . . that was a moment or two somewhere in the late 60s and early 70s, maybe we might have found something beyond the yellow brick road. Something not burned by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Some cooperation. Something innocent and critical at once. Something about dancing. <br /> <br /> But we missed it. As King bent a beam, the "revolution" was emblazoned on itself. Into sexism. Racism. Homophobia. And class crushing politics. Until we got to "W". Treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that movie. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence on the drunk, raging bull in estuaries, children's lives and China stores. <br /> <br /> We should have done something more. Something better. But we clearly didn't know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
