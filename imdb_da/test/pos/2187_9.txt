Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it virtually swept all the prices that were conceivable, the cash card was not expected, and the original production ended its term of 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the game went on tour - and on the way, film was captured. The result is a remarkable recording of the game with George Hern, who replaced Cariou and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway scene. <br /> <br /> However, there is an error. Simply put, the scene plays movies not really well, for a performance that works well on stage, must fill the theater and is therefore very, very large - and when placed on film, such performances often seem a little static, oppressive aggressive or both. SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen in film, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera, this is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; her more than lifetime practice reads on movies as unpleasantly hectic and her extremely operative voice feels out of place when in contrast to the voices of the overall cast. Considering this scene-play-on movie effect, this is truly an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mix of stupidity, stupidity and cunning evil, while Hern really owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients "go to their graves impeccably shaved." The overall cast is pretty nice, and although the film doesn't let us see enough of the set, there is plenty to show that it's impressive. And the music! Who can argue for what most regards Sondheim's best work? The story itself is extremely well known, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst joined several urban myths for a brief story entitled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year it was adapted to the scene as SWEENEY TODD, DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET - and in an era that knew a little about copyright, variations of the game soon played across England. However, each one was pretty much the same: Sweeney Todd, a shaver, kills the men who come to him for shaving; Mrs. Lovett, his associate, backs them up in pies and feeds them into an unsuspecting audience. The Sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very Grand Guignol, with lots of blood, organs that throw down casts and grotesque humor; At the same time, music, texts and subplots of an innocent in the couplings of evil open the subject of many lyrical charms that one would not expect. Sondheim's texts are often ironic, but never more than here; He mixes a great deal of evil satire about industry and capitalism along the way, and you certainly can't fault the strange yet Victorian-elegant of his complex music. As the "concert version" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this film also gives us more choices that were cut from the 2007 Tim Burton movie version, especially the opening "Join Sweeney Todd's Tale" which runs as a thread throughout the drama. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more cartoon than the film, which tends to suppress comedy in favor of an ever-larger show of blood. Whatever the case, if you're a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a groundbreaking one. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
