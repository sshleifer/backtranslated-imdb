A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's a "how far would you go?" movie. Walter Mattau again shows his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in like Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse bum. This movie gives you a rare screen shot of Lousiana Cajun horse racing. He has a young quarter horse, which is a top racing view. "only had a gas station and a good horse." The Bourdels take the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse Shadow, to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to get ready to run in All-American Futurity. But how far does Lloyd go to gain fame and fortune? Also memorable from this movie are scenes by Lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck to start.
