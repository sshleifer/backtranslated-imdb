(Interestingly, the package lists the movie's star as "Charles Bone" that sounds like a porn star but reaches the role of credit is obvious, the picture is pointed to the far right of the TV screen so that all the casting members lack the last letter from their names) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation they desperately Tenants in a creepy New York City apartment complex know you are in for a roller coaster ride from fromage. The direction is from the 'Ed Wood one-take' school - if one or two extras looked at the camera's crew, what the hell? <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a plot twist that puts The Usual Suspects to shame.
