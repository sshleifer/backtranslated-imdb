I recently stumbled upon a TV show of "Passion ...." (after missing the opening scenes). Ms. Currier is in favor of being praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange Balzac tale to the screen. I am grateful for the whole role and crew of their parts in producing such a good fine film picture. It must have been difficult to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can't understand how her trainer coaxed so nice "performance" from leopard, Simoon. (This ad calls for another exciting adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why isn't this movie more known? Hope I can find it on video.
