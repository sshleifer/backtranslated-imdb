A very moving and thought-provoking film that raises questions about mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sounds a little too heavy? It's a bit, but it is all dealt with realistically right in a story about the changes that are taking place to the family who are going to handle these things. This is a positive story of turning to life and responsibility, which is not overwhelmed by the subject. The afterlife is beautifully shot and created movies set in modern times and dealing with modern issues. It is a character-driven, enchanting film with a strong casting and some very good performances. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of movie that always works well at the cashier's office, so take it when you can.
