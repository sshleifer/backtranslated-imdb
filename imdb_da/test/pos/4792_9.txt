A blackish cartoon of a depressed priest, Nazarin shows the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve in order to tell a deeply humanistic fable with a minimum of hassle. As a product of its Mexican era of film making, it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel's former Mexican films in the play (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and theme. <br /> <br /> The theme is interesting, something that was explored again in Viridiana, made three years later in Spain. It is about the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism among a society that rejects any concept of virtue. However, Father Nazarin is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. While the latter seems to choose charity because she wants to perpetuate her (perceived) sins, Nazarine's whole existence and reason to appear to help others is whether they (or we) like it or not. The film's last scenes, in which he casts doubt on his behavior and in a split second must choose between the life he has led or the conventional life expected of a priest, is so emotional because they relate to his moral integrity and we are never quite Make sure it remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie and I would encourage anyone interested in classic cinema to find out. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my opinion, Nazarin's second only to 'The Exterminating Angel' in terms of his Mexican films and is quite surely close to the top of the Bunuel's total cinematic output list.
