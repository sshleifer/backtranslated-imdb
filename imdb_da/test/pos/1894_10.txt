I find this movie meretricious, preliminary, dull and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw a script, turn on the camera and act a fool. I find the inauspicious performances, lighting, movies, sound and whatever the film school laws D 'Urville Martin broke fun. Talking from a movie director's perspective is there times, I just want to let go of everything and have fun on the set. This movie looks like fun. When other senior film directors ask me advice, I just tell them to watch movies by Rudy Ray Moore. They always return to a baffled look and ask me why not see gentlemen Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and include that you always want to know what you should not do in film-historical tale first.
