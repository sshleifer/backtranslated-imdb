These three directors are off to a good start. The three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and capture the traumatic feelings of "coming out" when you're not quite sure it's a good idea. I laughed at the blurred look around the locker room in "Pool Days"; I smiled at the notion that fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are believed to be homosexuals in "A Dorothy friend" (ie to browse the CD music shelves); and I cringed over "jock" in "The Disco Years" whose memory of sweet sex was now "blurred" by spirits. It all seemed so right. I look forward to more offers from this trio of directors.
