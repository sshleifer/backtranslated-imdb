Three children are born at the same time under a moonlight. Just before their 10th birthday they start on a killing spree. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical slasher from the early 80s. It is a beautiful average material with lots of nudity. evil children never create a threat, and there is almost no tension. There is also no gore or scare in "bloody birthday", but the movie is mildly entertaining. Unfortunately, there is no real explanation for the kids sudden homicidal way. The murder scenes are rather cruel, for example, we have died using guns, baseball bat, jumping rope and shovel. So if you are a fan of early 80's slasher movies, then you get a look.
