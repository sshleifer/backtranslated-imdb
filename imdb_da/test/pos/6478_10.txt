Pat O'Brien had his best role ever as Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. From the humble beginnings, Rockne came to Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He is in chemistry, but becomes a fantastic football player and hero. At the end, he teaches chemistry at school, but he has the football fever dragging on him, this forcing him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game. In a way, the school had probably lost a great chemistry teacher - clearly far better and nicer than the one I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be precise.) <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. He will not tolerate academic underperformance. He is a coach for all seasons. O'Brien catches the common kind of touch. One of his students, George Gipp, played memorable in a fine short supporting performance by Ronald Reagan. The years go by and the performances run high, but Knute is the same kind of coach who testifies to the congress when he is in doubt. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is excellent as a notre dame priest who knew the rocks were meant to train football. Albert Basserman is sufficient, but his Jewish accent in the priest's portrayal is at best awkward. Basserman was nominated for that year in the category "Foreign Correspondent". <p> <p> Rockne's tragic death in a plane crash robbed the world for many years by a completely professional wonderful man. The movie is amazing.
