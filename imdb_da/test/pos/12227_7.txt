There cannot be denied it. Sci-fi on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings with it. Like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent action. Maybe the budget and the manuscript are the departments where I feel most attempts have failed. So does the "Surface" succeed? Not quite, but more than most. How I see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need much CGI to work, nor does it need much money. What it needs is the ability to create a feeling that is greater than life. The feeling that there is more than meeting the eye, something to make me curious and willing to try to figure out how it will end. Adding pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had a few flaws. First of all, the basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the enlightened story as exciting (or daring) as I hoped in the beginning. Also the TV feeling is very present much of the time. The whole way from crappy CGI (ranging from decent to terrible) to the rather changing quality of the acting department. Also it sometimes feels a little too family oriented because it takes the edge off sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. But apart from these mistakes, it's a fun show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. But it manages to keep me interested throughout the season, and it also gives a couple of good cliffhangers between shows. The end for me is not that appealing. I don't like shows that end without ending up saying and telling the story unresolved. This is especially unfortunate in this case, as the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it has not yet been decided). <br /> <br /> HBO is my benchmark for quality television. Their series has the best actors, the best production values ​​and above all the most solid writing. This is not HBO quality, but it is good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
