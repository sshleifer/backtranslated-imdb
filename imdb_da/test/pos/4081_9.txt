As an ex-Merchant Seaman, I was really interested in this movie: I've personally been involved in a stowaway search to leave Kingston Jamaica where a person was found. We managed to get him ashore even though we were in territorial borders. On another ship I was on the stove, was found, and we could not land him anywhere due to passport / nationality problems. In fact, he spent a year as an almost "honorary" crew member and worked for his preservation. Africa is notorious for stop-pickup. There is a big scene at the beginning of the movie when the bulk ship enters the African port: her size dwarfere all. The crew pops ashore for a little intercourse and hassle. So far normal. The drama begins when the living rooms enter the large hull of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drinking problem that is harassed by his Nemesis Suchet just like Company representative on board. Stowaway search is classic, but we didn't have weapons. I question the use of weapons in this movie. This ship appeared to have a large arsenal. In my experience, weapons at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations. Also having a dog on board was odd.Anti Rabies laws, especially in Europe, restrict the cultivation of animals seriously. Anyway Pertwee is brilliant as the damned mate. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the gloomy metallic background of the ship holds and a feeling that there is nothing to hide adds to the drama. Such cargo ship members are not in the murder and those involved are gradually being sucked into a world of violence from which there is no escape. Passing through the ship are the engine room scenes "the edge of the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia is abundance. The feeling that metal is pushing in and death is just a pistachio away. The movie is brutal: my boyfriend had to give up watching it while shooting and beating scenes. While this continues, Suchet in the comfort of his well-appointed cottage is being completely ignorant of mayhem 3 decks below. It's an exciting movie, lacking in parts, but the real message is that we can all be sucked into violence like this. Slowly and safely. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks who drafted these train schedules. I always remember someone who had visited the Dachau Concentration Camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the S.S. Guards had put a bird table outside the camp. This movie is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
