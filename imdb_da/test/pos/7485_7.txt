We're taken to a grocery store where Nick looks at coins in hand if he can get that special, a 69 cent 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry. He decides to go to the larger size, which is, of course, more expensive plus it does not qualify him for the cake. He is trying to argue with the Indian clerk on the register who is holding her land. In her, it is in principle. Now Nick gets annoyed, doesn't get his own way and continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the beginning. The people we are meeting are not nice guys. There is Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas, and their partner Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former crime partner, in Houston. He wants to make one more transaction and then go to Paris with the profit from selling the drugs he brings. What he does not know is that Casey has gone straight. He is an architect, married to Christine, and wants to adopt a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of things by rinsing them in the kitchen drawer. The unobtrusive arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery man, takes Casey surprised. This man has been sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings some grass to share with Ice, who has a talent for rapping. It is at this time that Dr. Jarvis, the man from the adoption body arrives. Casey's application shows a two-year hole that he cannot justify. Jarvis begins to doubt the potential father. At this time, Dallas makes an entry. She is a woman who asks questions, is empty, as when she asks to know if Jarvis enjoys watching porn. Jarvis, who is woken up, ends up walking in a huff. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There is a surprise in the store when Billy Hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees and shoots Dallas in the process. Billy Hill has also come to Casey, but he is oversteer. <br /> <br /> Casey gets Kasarov's visit wishing to get his money from Nick; In his absence, he takes it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline, and Casey gets ready to wipe out all those low lives. He has all the parties come to his house for a certain hour, and the various factions take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes taking Christine for a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Never have we heard of "Thursday" we were drawn on because of the talent in it. Skip Woods corrected his own material. This seems to be a movie with good intentions. At times, the movie remembers others of the same genre, not a sin of any kind or form, which seems to be the main object of the negative comments left here on the IMDb page. For starters, "Thursday" shows a witty Skip Woods who has gone to write other films, especially "swordfish". The play is divided into chapters with clear titles relating to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with mostly interior photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes an excellent contribution to the movie with his Casey. Although it is hard to imagine, he has beaten the odds and made something out of himself. This actor, recently seen in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors we are not tired of seeing. A dark-haired Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who does not show any redeeming qualities or anything close to remorse and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his arrangement. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a beautiful creature who is only a distraction or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He does an average audition on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke are also shown.
