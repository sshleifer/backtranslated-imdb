I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Sure it's not the best children's experience, but don't people stop despising Barney so much after fifth grade? All right, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's a little scary and weird. I'm fourteen years old, I know well enough. But here's the case. Children? They love this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a young child of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did otherwise. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, such are toddlers. Even the most patient cannot sit still enough to give their parents a break. There is too much to do and see and explore, too many problems to enter. <br /> <br /> Then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that is so entertaining for kids, but they love it safely. I know I did. I was hooked on the show and wanted to see it again and again. Yes, the songs have run my parents' nuts, but to be able to see their children learning and being excited about something that can really keep their attention tension, it's worth it. I learned my ABC and 123, the magic words and brush your teeth. I had grown out of it with five or six of course, but at least I was a little more patient and gave my parents a break. My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney scene growing up, much to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney in the air. He is entertaining. Of course there are Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they are also good. But on the toddler stage, it seems that more children prefer the great song dinosaur. And that's enough for me.
