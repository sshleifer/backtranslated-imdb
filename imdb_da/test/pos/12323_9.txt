So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but usually it is necessary to cut down a complex novel to the size of a manuscript. The dead are unusual - it should be 'padded', as the short story itself is a small, relatively short gem. It can actually be the finest short story in English. In beautifully free language, he tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are governed by memories of the dead. Even his own wife for many years loved a man more dead than him. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a brief history to the cinema will always be difficult. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave the temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand the story. It's simple and true, with excellent plays. The only small miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. It is rarely for a film version of a literary masterpiece to be himself a masterpiece, but I find it reasonable to use this term for this film. It's not a bravura piece of film making, but it's simple and clean. I always think of Oz's movie when I think of The Dead, it's on the level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.
