Ok firstly if you are not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with this. You really have to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is basically snakes .. on a train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an old curse involved and a crazy ending that I will not destroy. The gore effect is full and really icky ... but the movie is essentially a big gory gag about snakes that scare hell out of a crowd of people caught on a train. The excitement is built up well and there are some memorable and well-composed scenes .. some of the actors are a little hammy (look for surf dudes) but it's not real point ... Give this movie a ride. Know what to expect and you won't regret it!
