This movie is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her attempt to beat her school Cornwell boys team after they kicked out the girls' team. So she goes to rival school Illaria and joins the boys' team when she falls for Duke (Channing Tatum) who seems to be a guy and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the 12th night game and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the game well. I was very happy to watch this movie and when I saw it exceeded my expectations. It kept many of my favorite lines and I could see great connections to the game. Although it was like the doctor, it wasn't that complicated. It was also more of a chick flick than expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It draws you in a whole lot of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how viola (Amanda Bynes) mistakenly thought about what guys were thinking and her complications in living in a world of fire. You can also see her companion, Duke's (Channing Tatum) impression of this. I really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "Follow your dreams", but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and got stuck for herself and her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars.
