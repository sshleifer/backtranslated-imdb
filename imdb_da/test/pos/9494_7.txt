"Do not Change Your Husband" is another soap opera comedy from Producer / Director Cecil B. De Mille. It is remarkable as the first of several films he made starring Gloria Swanson. I suppose you could also call it a successor to its "Old Wives For New" (1918). James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter is a Pentecostal couple where James is seeded and blunt and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eats rye smoke. He takes his wife for granted. Leila is trying to get him out to no avail. <br /> <br /> One evening at a dinner party at the portraits, Leila meets the dashed Schyler Van Sutphen (now there is a moniker), the playboy nephew of socialite wife Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for the weekend to get James to "miss her". Once there, Schyler begins to move her and promised her joy, wealth and love if she wants to leave her husband and go with him. The sequences that involve Boga's notion of this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast by De Milles epic costume drams later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila is bored with her marriage and her uninterested husband, separates James and marries the playboy. In the end, James realizes that he has lost all that matters to him and begins to offset his ways. He shaves his mustache, works out, shines onions and recovers some manners. Meanwhile, everything is not rosy with Leil's new marriage. Schyler seems to like to gamble and has taken up with the gold digger Nanette (aka Tootsie, or any such name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leil's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> A fateful day, Leila meets the "new" James and is taken off the changes in him. James runs her home and becomes aware of her situation and ....................................... .......... <br /> <br /> This movie marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's rise to superstars in a career that would compete with Mary Pickford. Nearly 20 years old, she had started her career in Mack Sennett's two-reel comedies as a teenager. Elliot Dexter was nearly 50 at this time, but he and Swanson are doing a good team, although it's hard to imagine any tedious of the lovely Miss Swanson as it is in this movie. Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in the similar "old wives to new", where the wife had gone to seed, and the man was wronged. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are De Mille fixed Theodore Roberts as bishop and Raymond Hatton as gambler.
