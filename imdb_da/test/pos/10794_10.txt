"Talk Radio" is my favorite Oliver Stone movie, though he has made many good ones, including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of Talk Talk, a cinematic extension of Eric Bogosian searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer Robert Richardson makes Stone what could have been a very tied exercise in a visually appealing ideological battle that presents a radio station as a war arena. Bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouts of abuse Barry Champlain and conveys the conflicting, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. Alec Baldwin, as his Alpha male boss, hits the perfect note as a man powered nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. Ellen Greene is great as Barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up being another goal for her evil personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and any dialogue line with sweet poison and skewed ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as Barry's long-lasting screener / technical producer Stu, turns in a hilarious performance like the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underestimated masterpiece of outstanding writing, great acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The Stewart Copeland score is also brilliant.
