Andreas arrives in a strange city. He can't remember where he came from and how he got there. He is ordered to come to work and gets his own apartment in town. All his colleagues are kind and polite to him, they say hello and smile when they pass him. But then later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as comfortable as it seems. When he goes home from work, he sees some people wearing gray suits, clearing the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim who had thrown himself out of the window. The procedure is performed with a calm mind as if emptying a trash can. The following day Andreas meets the suicide victim alive at work. More and more Andreas discovers the city's numb atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The annoying one can be the best Norwegian movie I've seen. Original, artistic management usually lacks in Norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. The plot is also very original and could even be called postmodern horror, as the film presents us with a frightening thought of coping with a world that is completely numb. And the more you try to fill your life in this city with a meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. I am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of a disembovled universe, a nightmare that you simply cannot escape from, not even with death. <br /> <br /> See, it's really worth it! I gave it 9 out of 10.
