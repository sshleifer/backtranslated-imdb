This is an excellent criminal thriller, and with a great cast too. The best and most popular actors of the Spanish language in the last few decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, join forces in one of the better Spanish language detectives from 2004-5. <br /> <br /> The movie begins by focusing on thirty something Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and slender thief who learned from childhood friend Gitano, and recently from Manco, an ancient spicy scammer. Manco introduces Ernesto to Federico (Federico Luppi), also an elegant but smart and experienced methodical thief - the best in his class. Federico's only known weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former mistress and partner. She suddenly appears and suggests a fabulous rip-off scheme for her former lover, a large-scale crime that will eventually require help from, among other things. Ernesto, Manco and Gitano. <br /> <br /> The scripture is full of twists and surprises, especially at the end of the movie. One criticism of the movie I heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end, but I disagree. The film captures the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, these are the ones that make the movie excellent. I highly recommend it.
