Wow, here's another great golf movie. It is at least three in the last few years that I really enjoyed, it was well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance." <br /> <br /> This is a true underdog story if ever there was one. To get an amateur defeat all professionals and win the US Open Golf Tournament is an unheard of feat. I think this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been achieved. How much of this movie is fiction adorned for dramatic effect, I don't know. I know I'm planning to read the book, and I know that in reality Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in the playoff with only two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the movie. <br /> whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legend Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is actually. It's a great story, and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It's not just for golf fans; This is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned director Bill Paxton for an excellent job. Yes, much of this is simply golf, but there are subgroups such as Ouimet's relationship with her father and with a beautiful young woman who is, of course, interested in him. It is also a moving story about someone who gives a baby a chance. The film also deals with Vardon's demons from coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it an elitist sport as it was at the time of both Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is tasty like Ouimet who is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like his Tiger Tiger, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is depicted as a warm, good guy; a real man. The other big competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as something of a brutal creepy guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth protagonist of this golf story can be the coolest person in the movie: a fifth-grade boy who wins up as Ouimet's caddy in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie. <br /> <br /> If all this - a playoff with the great underdog against two mighty benefits and having come down to the last hole - was not true you would think: "Oh, man, it's so hokey. Who could believe this? " That is what makes the story of this life story fun to see finally caught on film. As with another 2005 movie - "Cinderella Man" - here is another excellent movie that was wrongly ignored when it came to prizes. I suppose fine movies don't win awards ..... just their viewers' hearts.
