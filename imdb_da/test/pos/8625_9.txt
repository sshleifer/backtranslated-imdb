About 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr are first mentioned, there is a really beautiful song to play ... what is that song? And who is it sung by? It's a song that sounds very romantic, and it's a female singer, piano player, etc. I've tried everything in the world to look at the music on Google and iTunes, etc. But it just doesn't come up, not even on lyrics sites. So, if you hear that, I would love to know enough about it so I can either try to take the CD of that song on it or find it in iTunes. I don't know if my email will pulblish, I'm new to this ... but I'll look back here.
