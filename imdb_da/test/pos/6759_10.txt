There is a complete copy now available on the internet archive - see it or download it today! <br /> <br /> http://www.archive.org/details/The_Mascot_Complete <br /> <br /> One of the biggest animated shorts ever made. Starewicz is infinitely inventive and his techniques still amaze animation fans 70 years later. We can have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was a fantasy that would not take "no" to an answer. What he even wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see some really bizarre things - every imaginable piece of scrap is called for service: old shoes, chicken legs, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats .... seem like there was not something outside the borders. A really scary, even disturbing movie, to be seen by everyone with an equal interest in animation. This movie should be seen as believed!
