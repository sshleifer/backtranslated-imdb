doesn't sound like it was from a fantasy movie. The film is dark, with dark overtones. The soundtrack is too uplifting to the point it intruded on the pictures. I'm sure they were targeting something militant, but it just didn't work. The scene where Astin is trying to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like Goonies? There is no comedy, there is no brightness to this !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is amazing and the play is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's performances. It is available on Netflix online display. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, but write your own soundtrack !!
