Maybe I was just in a really good mood when I watched this movie. But for some reason I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a little predictable? Yes. So what? It was still a really nice movie. I always wanted Bruce Willis (well, almost always there was the Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b *** ard perfect. Perhaps this film is not Academy Award material, but it is probably a good material. Go rent it.
