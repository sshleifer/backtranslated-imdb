I had the pleasure of seeing these two trust from (one of?) Executive Producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed a lot of different times than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed in the Atlantic Canada is the movie about three teenage girls who, in one of their last summers of their youth, spend a lot of energy sleeping with a married 30-year-old man, despite much protestation. <br /> <It is definitely worth seeing, but humor was geared to a completely different demographic than the one I live in (Male 18-25), so I shook my head on the character's antics instead of laughing. Despite this, the story is strong enough to keep to itself making it entertaining, without so much laughing.
