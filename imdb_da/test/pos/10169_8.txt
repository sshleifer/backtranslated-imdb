Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own British film from 1934, "The Man Who Went Too Much". This 1956 taking the same story is much easier than the previous one. Hitchcock was fortunate to have partners who came with him from one movie to the next, keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job of cinematography and George Tomasini's editing shows his talent. In the end, Bernard Herrmann is seen at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London on the climax of the picture. James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to Marrakesh in a local bus, and the plot begins. His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. She had been a well-known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. The movie has some good supporters, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among other things, doing a good job of portraying their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "light hitchcock" it cannot be dismissed as a failure. "The Man Who Went Too Much" is a change in the pace of Hitchcock fans.
