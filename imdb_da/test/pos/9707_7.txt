Johnny Knoxville has gone crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass he rejoiced over practical jokes more than the physical things ?? his opening car rental gag and the later bit with an air horn on a golf course were more akin to a kind of extreme Candid camera ?? but in Jackass: second he is really away from his rocker. Beginning with a sequence in which he is hunted through a living room by a bull or later, when he is driving a rocket (a stunt that almost costs him his life due to an unexpected explosion on the rocket side), and especially when he intentionally faces a defense mechanism and taking a spray of pills to the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first movie Bam Margera and Steve-O? infamous party animals ?? They were daring, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville lure them to do a stunt. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a series of stunts drawn by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one another. It will eventually end in one of the cast members ?? in Jackass 2 Steve-O almost loses a leg for a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned) is almost inflicted on an explosion from a rocket etc. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed because of the success of 2, and honestly I can't imagine anything stunt that performs the bull's run in the opening scene of this movie ?? It's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% real. (Which is actually scary.) And as far as extremes are concerned, Jackass 2 surpasses his predecessor? It also feels more cinematic than the first movie, with less of the cheesy titles ahead of stunts known on the original MTV TV show. Unfortunately, the boys were too much free here and a good number of gags are simply lame exercises in crudity ?? I can enjoy occasional poop gag, but seeing a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or watch Steve-O take beer up the line (yes honestly), gets lattice after a while. Even from the boys in the screening I participated ?? who was thrilled when Wee Man took a playing card at the back and got zapped by a rigged chair ?? was disgusted by some of the scenes in this movie. It's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible ?? It's a matter of saying, "Is this even entertaining or fun?" Many times it is unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> But for every lama stunt involving fecal matter and catching people's faces, there are some amazing hidden camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dresses up like an old woman and hits the streets naked, with slowing breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite shit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoking and swearing and offending people. It's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the freedom of an R-rating. It's a shame they had to destroy all the big things? including a final segment involving a deeper terrorist project? with poop jokes along the way. <br /> <br /> There is still a lot of pure spirit and madness in this movie to tell a show, and it is really the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.
