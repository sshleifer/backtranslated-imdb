The antiwar musical "Hair" is my number one cult movie. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie in the theaters and on VHS, or how many times have I listened to the CD with the amazing soundtrack, and now this masterpiece is finally released on DVD in Brazil. The pacifist and touching story is still amazing, a freedom hymn, friendship and freedom of choice, and the images of a generation's resistance to the stupidity of war. I don't know what happened to this wonderful generation of 70's counter-culture and their dreams, as the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. I can't remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their amazing performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely beautiful in the role of a hypocrite spoiled overclass teenager. I have seen "Hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while Berger goes on the plane and sings "It's me, I am, that is me" and I begin to cry with his tombstone in the cemetery . I think this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of cinema history. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this movie; therefore, I can guarantee that "hair" is timeless and recommended to any audience. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
