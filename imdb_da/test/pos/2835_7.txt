This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by the veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its main help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the-book, Cavalry Officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy for a massacre on a fort. He insists on bringing the man back to court to be sent to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner to trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means that the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead another patrol - and he chooses the men, the fort can save most, a problem community - to defend the fort quickly that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stop bottlenecks in that sector. Like Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong. Second in the big cast of this movie, which really shows the life of a cavalry outpost, resembling an army's establishment of heterogeneous and frightening types, War Bond includes a hard-pressed sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemaker, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes who co-officers with Nana Bryant as Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest comes in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort scout. There are really two beautiful scenes in this much-favored western - the long section of the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and the long patrol for the convicted Ft. Defiant himself. Once upon a time, Peck gets to deliver a grand speech, where at the request of the men he has asked for orders, telling them why he brought them together. read their missing one after another; they tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place, take the Indian instead of walking himself - and he proves them wrong for the rest of the movie by winning his lonely fight through intelligence and courage. Franz Waxman's music is good, the quality of production admirable; The argument about what would happen if Lance takes the warlord in, happens to be true; Other than this irreparable error of the central character, this is great Western. It has been my favorite for fifty years.
