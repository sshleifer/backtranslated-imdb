Family happiness crumbles when the original rich father Ward (Michael Ontkean) becomes poor and can no longer support the family. Then, the mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) must take the role of breadwinner in the family and start working to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, to manage family life. Not always as good, but as good as possible. Family life hardly gets easier when his father learns that his son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and lives with his girlfriend John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400") also an old family friend, resulting in Dad making it clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who thought most of her sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her upbringing when the family neglected her. Anne cannot claim that their father has cut cords with Lionel and therefore she runs from home. As this was not enough, his son Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") hurls into the Navy and is sent to war. The story in this movie can sometimes feel a little thin, despite the fact that it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it worth seeing. As this movie illustrates many sensitive relationships and situations, I would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience, even though it would not hurt teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood.
