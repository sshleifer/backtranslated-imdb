Following the lines of the classic formula to a point to take another leap away from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest genres of its time. John Carpenter fashion out of what must have been a rather vague play about certain things (or perhaps very descriptive who knows) that produces incredibly miserable, brilliant doll and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the tough, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the midst of an Arctic climate, encountered a vicious force that takes the forms of others. It gets a lifetime of Carpenter's choice of tones and surprises. For anyone to follow in Howard Hawk's footsteps, the filmmaker here has much more confidence and talent in performing the material than most people got the chance to get another go with an old movie. <br /> <br /> With the effects people are working at full power - in the midst of what is likely to follow Backdraft as the most diligent per scene (it can get overkill, but it all fits into the thrill after a while) - the actors draws together as a fine ensemble. Unlike the Predator squad, these are mostly just regular workers' lads, with the manager coming from Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent indeed). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs like Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it's refreshing to see how that kind of absurdity in what's going on in the movie (a stranger starting with dogs and then moving in on the others in gory, demented transformative form) is pit against such a tone of timing with all. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricon's spooky, curious music in the background (and that the baseline is beneficial in itself). It is right to be, if nothing else delivers what it strives for its genre / cult audience. It's still one of Carpenter's best; a rare horror of horror movies, where the story is told clearly and precisely using the camera's position, dialogue and timing with the scenes. It is not to say that the film is not full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it is almost fun. But considering that it goes back to what is ridiculously seemingly like an away era, creatures / make-up along with the stable, well-calculated script were completed completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's true and atmospheric to a T.
