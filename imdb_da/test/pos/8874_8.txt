You can't see the meaning of the title much later, but you get the point with it in the first few minutes. This direct debut from Golden Globe nominated (for actor) Danny DeVito, who also plays Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a fantastic Hitchcock-like movie about a man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his) and a man's hatred for his mother. Basically, Owen will be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he is inspired by murder stories. Larry suggests he sees a Hitchcock movie, quite ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea of ​​killing Larry's former wife, Margaret (Star Trek Voyagers Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', changes murder, so Larry has to kill Oven's terrible Momma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen killed Margaret and also that he would / would kill Owens Momma, but there is a good ending when months later both Larry and Owen bring out books, Momma died naturally and they went on holiday with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also contributing to Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With hilarious moments, a fantastic instructor / actor and his support, this is a must-have comedy. Very very good!
