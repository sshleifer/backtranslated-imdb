Friz Freleng's "All Abir-r-r" is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons. Unlike the many repeated comics in the series, which simply transplant the same tired gags into a new setting, 'All Abir-r-d' makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are farm animals that are sent without supervision over land by train. With both a vigilant official and an evil bulldog to handle, Sylvester has cut out his work. Sylvester and Tweety cartoons have always enjoyed some extra participants, and 'All Abir-r-r-d' is a good example of how much these extra characters help. Although they are not particularly memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in Sylvesters way and create a more interesting battle. This early Sylvester and Tweety card pushes many of the right buttons, and while Tweety is often particularly annoying with his forced cuteness, there are some deliciously violent fakes between Sylvester and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which, unfortunately, is ruined by a final unfunny non-quip of Tweety.
