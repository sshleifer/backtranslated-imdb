At first thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for Stan Lee's entertainment. I expect no more than a blurred, animated version of Barb Wire with low production values, like the short crap you see on Adult Swim for short-lived entertainment, but can never be taken too seriously. Boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they have taken this series very seriously and made it a great effort to make it a professional production as possible. <br /> <br /> The humor is also good on the sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. It's very similar if it doesn't look like the Simpsons style. You may encounter clichés and a lot of predictable humor, but it's still fun anyway. If this were running today, I would definitely see it regularly. It is surprisingly one of the better toons ever made.
