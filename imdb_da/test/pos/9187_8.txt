This movie was not about stereotypes, nor dance movements or pickup lines. This film was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role that Will Smith could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this movie - it wasn't "groundbreaking" in any way - but it was a movie worth seeing. Was it credible? No. New York couldn't be that simple, and there has been no human being in the history of humanity that has Hitch's "hutzpah". Sure, there are bar-studs, but not those that can get any chick at any time - except for the raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this movie was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was fun two hours without a doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your room, be immersed in the characters and smile.
