Everyone likes the coolly created, memorable hoist movie. Alain Delon delivers antihero, Melville gives it cool and a handful of other great talent (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourvil, for the most part) will add a crisp exciting movie ... <br /> <br />. .. with very little dialogue. This is good because a particular aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialogue involving the fast-witnessed and their various reparties. However, this movie could be seen with the sound completely off and not terribly much would be missed. Not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the clear sound that catches the small movements make the patient's slow, patient consideration very convincing. What is also really nice about this movie is that the color kinematics is pretty amazing. Usually when it comes to filmography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this movie has some very powerful and beautiful images that make the movie pure visual pleasure to observe. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
