This early film by upcoming goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the Giallo subgenre. Seen in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children as a whole. Add to the mix a number of characters that are familiar to fans of giallo cinema ?? a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffective police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a mentally retarded lonely, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Unusual For a gigo, in this case, the victims are young boys who change from the more typical women in danger. The fact that it is the children who are the target of the maniacet serves only to make things a little more unpleasant. Fulci pushes the envelope a little here, and he goes even further in a glorious monstrous unPC scene, where a young boy is exposed to the slightly inappropriate attention of a sexy nude young woman (Barbara Bouchet) whom he is tasked with delivering a drink to . She appears openly and actively encourages the youth to pull her; Eventually ask him if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she clearly plays around with him, it is still an unusual scene. Admittedly, there are one or two unintentionally fun pieces of dialogue here, but it is very nicely photographed, and Barbara Bouchet exudes a high level of confident sex appeal. A standout scene. Although you may feel a little wrong seeing it! <br /> <br /> Together with Barbara Bouchet, Florinda Bolkan's second standout performance plays a lunatic who is accused of killing the children. She is not directly responsible, but it is left to the viewer to determine if her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing. Regardless of whether she is chased by a lynch mob and the chain whip while a car radio explodes rock music. This scene is very strong and uncomfortable. Its evil indicates the path Fulci's career will later go. Despite the visceral effect of the above murder, it may be a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed off-screen. The only other death scene that can be compared to lynch mob is the death of death at the end of the movie, although this order is kind of stupid. The plot is decayed and flooded with red herring, although I personally found the killer's identity a little predictable. This weakness is less problematic with subsequent viewing though ?? Like most gialli, do not torture A duckling is very rethinkable. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is made with impressive camera work, solid and effective music from Riz Ortolani ?? Especially good is a recurring solitary companion who sounds like it comes from a remote hill. Of course, Fulci continued to make more graphically violent horror films, but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material. However, it is still wild stuff and highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.
