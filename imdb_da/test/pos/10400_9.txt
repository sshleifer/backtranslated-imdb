Like a lot of horror fans out there looking for the next big scary flick, we plundered the Asian horror market for what we could get, and no dark haired ghost lady became impossible. We had good reason to do what the Asian market had created as scary wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon-Grudge and a number of two sisters. When Takashi Miike started tearing the micket out of the One Missed Call genre in 2003, the market seemed to dry up so it was open to blasphemy and mockery despite the continued Hollywood Remake Machine working full steam ahead. Don't make me wrong, there were still lots of good Asian horrors being made, just like Marebito and Shutter, to name but two, will stand as minor genre classics one day. But the long-haired ghost lady had definitely had her food at the party, and it was time to take that success full of stupid tramp home! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A movie that is smart enough to pay subtle tribute to it's roots, but throws the rule book out of the window while you do it. What I will describe in terms of plot will probably make you believe there is nothing new here at all. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tips offs on ghostly goings on. He begins to examine a woman's claim that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, but there is no baby there except for a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharply when the reporter shifts his nose around, but strange other coincidences begin to pop up. A psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a beautiful young actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very creepy demon named Kagutaba, which led to a really scary showdown in a small historic city. <br /> <br /> Saying more about the plot can ruin the fury a little. The movie is shot in "faux documentary" mode and includes recordings from TV shows and news reports, and the labels by subtitles let you know where you are in terms of the timeline. The movie has drawn more than a few comparisons with the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy walk through the woods late at night, the comparison really ends. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing about Noroi is how it does not pander to modern horror audiences. If you expect croaky ghosts to get out of the ceiling, look elsewhere. The film's strength lies in the slow, gradual build-up of terror, a terror so deep that it will keep you for days after seeing it. The Climax is pretty damned, but when you think the movie is over, you are treated to the 'right' end when the credits begin to roll and sweet Saints f * ck, it's a killer. In terms of acting, it is predominantly convincing. You get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, blind foil covered by clairvoyant, but it soon dries up halfway through the film. The film also has a weaker feel than a lot of Asian ghost fear, as there is also a tremendous touch to some of the events. Overall, Noroi is one to see on her own, late at night. Not since my first show of Ringu ten years ago, I've been so terrified and watching a horror movie. It is someone who will scratch you to you until it's too late, then it's under your skin. Just let yourself go to this. And not a long-haired ghost lady in sight ?? No wonder it has barely been released outside of Japan, let alone an American remake lined up yet. Check this out if you can, important view in my books!
