I first saw this movie in the early 80's on cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things I'm sure I missed. But a year ago it came back in my life when I started enjoying it with my son. He is a little young (9) for many of the themes in it, but he understands that dance hippies are fun to watch and he gets the idea that the end is ironic. While I can't think of other movies in this genre, it has a standalone genius I love. It also makes a unique justice to Central Park. Most musicals are lost to me somehow. "Tommy" was over the top and heavy road in the direction, "Oliver" seemed like crowd control on the silver screen, "The Wall" was so much abstract self-meaning and indulgent dribble, but listened to "Failure of the Flesh" from Hair sounds right to Our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it must have in the sixties ... really timeless.
