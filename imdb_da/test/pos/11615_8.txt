Going into this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme flick, and I knew it was something artistic. Both appeal to me in their own right, but when placed together it can be quite unique. And it was completely wrong, no doubt, unique. As I said above, it is an artistic film. The way they used an intense sound reminded me a lot about an Aronofsky movie. Visually, I have not seen anything like this. The camera and lighting were done very well. The film is seriously serious and sounds better than anything I've seen for a while. Especially when you are considering the experiences these young filmmakers had (couple of 20s), you really need to take your hat off them. <br /> <br /> The movie is not easy to describe or even discuss. There is no real story. You can say that it is about the right and left sides of the brain and how they control your life? I think. There are four segments, or four ideas are brought alive through visual and auditory extremities. There are some speakers to hear and there, but it is mostly a non-speaking movie. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest, and it's a naked body and an eye. Try and guess what happens. The second segment is my favorite. It involves a brother and a sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger breasts). The brother is crazy and the sister is a whore. I would say that this is the most extreme of all the segments and the most appropriate. The effects in this one were great. The third segment is about a bunch of naked people who cut it together with the mother earth. It is probably considered the weakest of the pile, but is still smart and well made. The fourth segment is probably the strongest of the movie, and I also want to say the deepest. For me, I have to see this a few times to understand what is really said. I know it tackles Christianity in a way that will most likely make your mother celebrate or vomit. Try it. <br /> <br /> Unconscious cruelty was recommended to me, and I am proud to say this is now in my movie collection. It is extreme, violent, horrified, very sexual and surprisingly rather thought-provoking. The next line I'm about to say has been used in almost every review I've read for this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." Now it's not the truth. If you are into extreme movies and / or you are just a lover of movies that want to see something else ??. Check this out. 8 1/2 out of 10
