Trust the excellent and accurate Junagadh75 review! This film is compelling and moves in the toughest, most brutally beautiful film masterpiece "way". File under UNFORGETTABLE STRONG MEAT. Or film that is by the moon. Pixote enters your nervous system and raises you despite the pain on the screen. Here is a non-related list of movies that did the same for me, ie. "Engaged, Destroyed, Transformed, Inspired, Reasoned ... This category exceeds Nerdy movie top ten lists seeking film perfection." A woman under the influence "Wiseblood", "Salary of fear" "Saint Jack" "Funny Bones" "Out of the Blue".
