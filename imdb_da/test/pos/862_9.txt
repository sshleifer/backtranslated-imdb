Wow, Stella Shorts is amazing! Lots of state and Stella patrons, the TV show. I never knew Stella could have gotten any better when they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also didn't know that short comedies could be good. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranging a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think about everything David was the funniest. It's fun when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in shorts. It's something I love a lot. They always had good taste in music. I wish they still made shorts, either it or bring back there sitcom. I hope they continue to make good and fun comedy.
