Although several scenes from Wirey Spindell can be described as "over the top". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo-twisted comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I don't want to say that this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you look beyond the occasional offensiveness and see it for the movie that it is, I would hope you could see it in the same light as I do.
