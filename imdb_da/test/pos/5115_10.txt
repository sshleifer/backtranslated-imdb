This movie brings so many memories back to me! I was very young when it came out, but I remember the first time I saw it! My father and I always wanted to see "Ernest Movies" together. We hadn't seen any of them for years and I found a couple of them really cheap. We saw them and couldn't stop laughing. I love all the "Ernest Movies" but this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler part! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" part. My father still makes the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very cheesy movie ... but a fantastic one! It's perfect for families (it's not like a lot of waste out there), but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!
