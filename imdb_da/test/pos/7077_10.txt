I watched this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and I saw an excellent one. This is now my most beloved movie. It did not leave me when I left the theater. The situation in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were just as incredible. This movie has made me aware of how important family relationships are. Rent it. I can't recommend it enough.
