It's been a while since I've seen Cold Mountain, a little I knew I enjoyed it immensely. Even though it takes place during the last days of the American Civil War, it's not really a war movie. It's more of a romance / drama. And it works. Much because of the performances. Unfortunately I don't like Nicole Kidman, but I liked here. I thought she was very convincing in her role. I liked Rene Zelwegger as well, who I usually am not a fan of.Jude Law is good as usual.the support cast.there are some good supporting ideas her, for many also for mention.there are also some breathtaking scenes in the movie. And there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well. The story is sad and tragic, but it's beautifully done well told story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
