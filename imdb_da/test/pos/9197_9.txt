This is probably one of those movies for many commented but undiscovered ... This is probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema like some Bu√±uel's masters piece. "15 days with you" could be better "now and then" re-visit from other movies from a long time ago: could be "Midnight cowboy", but could also be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or a realistic and non- spot-look (but most realistic) "trainspotting". This hard story has room for humor, love and of course dramatic feeling. In the new social Spanish cinema, this little diamond can be the resurrection of Italian neo-realism mixed with the best Ken Loach movies. <br /> <br /> Probably the better movie I discover in the last 10 years.
