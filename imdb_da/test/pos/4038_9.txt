"Snow Queen" is, of course, based on the adventure of the same name, gathered in (at least) Andersen's fairy tales - and unlike many other recent productions based on other adventures, this device retains Faerie, a performance not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary bans, goblins, dragons and demons must not be questioned in an adventure; they are so natural an element of Faerie that, for example, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is quite next to the point of history. Neither is the story bound by modern Hollywood compositional rules: directly, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in minor works and obvious (at least at least). <br /> <br /> With this defense against the common criticism of those who do not understand adventure, "Snow Queen" is a wonderful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting and great mood. The only mistake in the film was, in my opinion, not that it was too great, but that some parts of the dialogue were too sharp modern in slang and expression, a mar in the otherwise timeless nature.
