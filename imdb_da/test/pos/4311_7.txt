Nicely filmed, a bit uneven, "No" is a good evening's entertainment. The reason is simple enough - three yuppies enter a scrap with a group of strangers in a bar, and it turns out to be much more than they negotiated. The action is decent and there are a few unexpected phrases. Keep an eye out for the incredible (like 10 gun turrets and 25 shot semi-automatic pistol).
