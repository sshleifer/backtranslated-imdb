I just saw it last night and it was great. I can see why some ppl have bad feelings about it from a rugby fan and maori culture point of view, but except that I have no idea what is so negative about it. The movie is amazing. It has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging to all ages. Great family movie! They did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget film. I love movies based on true stories / events. I was raised around rugby all my life, it's a good game, but I was never really taken to it because (please forgive me if I offend anyone, not something personal, that's just how I saw it). I thought their training is not as ruthless or tough, the players are not as disciplined and not as serious as other athletes, and it looked like it was just muscles and thriving to tackle each other, etc. But having seen Forever strong, I was like, wow! I was proud! It did good things for rugby (well it changed my perception of rugby) and also New Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I'm not even New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. Didn't even know what the song meant until this movie. The movie is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even about New Zealand All Blacks or Haka or etc ...... Mother of pearls !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So to all you beautiful negative ppl, you are missing points! I'm sure if they had the funds, it would have been better, chin is in there because it was part of the Highland Rugby culture, tradition or whatever you would call it. <br /> <br /> If any new members on this page like myself, please do not be discouraged by the negative comments. See it for yourself! Must watch movies! There is much you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. It certainly makes you a better person and humble! This movie reminded me of a lot of things that I already know and was raised with, but I lost a little on the road! Loved it! Happy reading places and everything the best! Muawha!
