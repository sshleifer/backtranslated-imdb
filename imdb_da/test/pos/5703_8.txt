In retrospect, the 1970s were a golden era for the American cinema, which demonstrated and explored this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese. This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of ​​what that time meant for the career of these famous people in the documentary. The great way of working that remains is a legacy for all the people involved in the art of film making during that period. The decade was marked by the end of the Vietnam War and the turbulent finale of Jimmy Carter's Presidency year. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear, film today doesn't measure up to the movies that came out during the creative decade, because the industry as a whole has changed dramatically. The big studios today want to tame pictures that will be instant hits regardless of content or integrity as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenue. The second thing that emerges after hearing some of America's best creative thoughts speaks is the importance of the independent film spirit, because it is all about giving its creators good moral and artistic benefits. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a must for all movie fans.
