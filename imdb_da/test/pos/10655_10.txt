I did something a little bold tonight when I watched this movie. I tried to leave myself from silent movie results. Sure, when this movie was originally distributed, it was probably played with a piano score. Often the director would choose the actual score (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent movies is by no means the same music to be played when the movie was first released. And again there were lots of silent movies that were played without a score. I don't know Potemkin's story, so I decided to watch it for the media this work of art was produced in film. <br /> <br /> Shortly after I beat the music, unaided (or should I say unobstructed) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I was completely connected to the movie. Visually, it is easily one of the most amazing of all movies. Eisenstein was a composite master. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this movie is angry, and it shook my passions tremendously. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a quiet movie, especially a drama, but movies like the battleship Potemkin show that this effort is totally worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
