Not only does this movie have a great title, but simply the biggest drama I've ever seen. The viewer is unlimitedly drawn into the movie with 5 young men working together to try to overcome impenetrable odds, Sean Astin, as Billy Carpets are brilliant along with great supporting roles from TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the Gosset Guidance and Astin's characters make the film so much better. As time goes by, the film is still keeping pace and it is a disappointment that none of the young actors themselves made their name in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
