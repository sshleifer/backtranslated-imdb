This movie about a group of small towns that decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to get out of his little town, like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life." But unlike George Bailey, Brian will steal a bank to fund his dream of joining the art school, even though his father is not supportive. The offer to Brian is to act as a customer and distract the guard. It is a tempting offer that if they are offered to many, I ask what they would do. Anyways Brian does it. When the Sheriff (James Remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It's a standoff with even Feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. The sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way. Unfortunately, the tensions rise, and teens inside the teeth are muttering. Some are out of control. The paper knife scene is cruel and difficult to see. Very Intense!
