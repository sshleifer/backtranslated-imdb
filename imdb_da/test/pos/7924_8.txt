This film should be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. The original soundtrack is of course not exactly hi-fi, but there are many good versions available in classic music selections. The cantata can be appreciated for themselves, but after watching the movie helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty much standard Soviet war time, anti-German propaganda. An entertaining anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by appealing to Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eisenstein was posted to a German movie for a short period as a fine. Prince Alexander Nevsky (preached as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), who has earned his nickname by defeating Swedish raiders on the Neva River, designs Russian resistance to an invasion of the Teutonic Knights and ends his victory with a strict warning to other wild invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by Mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, as the Teutonic Knights are his priority. The historic Alexander Nevsky celebrates the Mongolian khans as his father before he works to consolidate the future independence of his kingdom.
