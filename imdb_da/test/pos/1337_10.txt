Hi what do you expect to create a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that as the media wrote about Jeff, this is a pretty accurate picture. I have studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned everything I can about this man. This is a low budget movie, but it shows a serial killer's mentality. If you can get past the go and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just brace yourself for the low budget and no blood. It is a story seen through the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood through his arrest. My favorite line is: "If they had bothered to look at the back seat, it could have saved many lives" Enjoy!
