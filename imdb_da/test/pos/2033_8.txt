I have to admit that I didn't expect much on this movie. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it as much as I did. The script was not oscar material, but it wasn't terrible either. The act was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great support role and as lovely as ever. What made this movie to me was the music. If you don't like 80s glam metal or hair band then you probably won't like this movie. It's about being rockstar. Some clich√©s were present, but the film didn't even go down at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to get up and shout !!! 8 out of 10 for great plays and great music. <br /> <br /> Jason
