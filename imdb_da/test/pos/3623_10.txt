Saw the movie at the final gala at the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although Crow & the Chinese Policeman does not appear and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (Writer / Director) pronounced / played by Lord Richard Attenborough seems very good. The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (like Dr. Goldstein) appeared in movies for just a pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown the movie, on video before he died and of all accounts enjoyed it immensely.
