Cult filmmaker Corbucci most likely of his thirteen Spaghetti Westerns (which I am only left with what I am doing between the revolution [1972] to catch) is one that I only became aware of right recently through Marco Giusti's "Stracult" guide; It is an atypical bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desolate snow-covered landscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Hallyday, the French Elvis Presley, whom I first saw in Jean-Luc Godards DETECTIVE (1985) is a curious but very effective choice to play the single-family hero (as, like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from Sergio Leone's famous "Dollars Trilogy", equipped with a steel plate armor for protection), I had "met" Hallyday's amazing daughter Laura Smet at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, but was distracted by the presence of her acclaimed director Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving virtually the same function that Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE) but rejoices well and is entertaining clumsy in the presence of a bathing Francoise Fabian; the latter plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces everything and everything to pursue his goals. Sylvie Fennec has the other great female role as a farmer taken care of by Hallyday and at one point is attracted to Free Love by the 'hippie' Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with this being mind it is worth noting that the film has surprisingly but welcome bouts of nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths (who are also involved in doping and revolutionary speeches) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance ?? But all in all, it adds to the fun (besides the black barmaid sports an Afro hairdresser!). Mario Adorf also enjoys a tremendous role as a larger than life Mexican bandit nickname "El Diablo" ?? who keeps a youthful cinema constantly by his side (an element that may have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and at one point challenges the imprisoned moschin to a headlong duel! After mentioning this, the movie also contains a very unusual death weapon? as Hallyday possesses an opponent by kicking the lounge records in his face! As always, the cozy fist fights are accompanied by over-emphatic sound effects; as typical of the genre, but the wistful score of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino appears as a major asset. In fact, the ambiguous ending is completely in line with the film's generally gloomy tone ?? After Fabian's uprising in the hands of the locals, the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly turned to him when they wounded and terrorized the city (forcing everyone on the street and unclean)? But the unexpected gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge (though they scare away with him!) And then ride out of town and leave Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I bought this through a widescreen print of good quality in Italian, but with French credits and occasional dropouts ?? about a minute of the screen in everyone ?? into the French language (where the original audio track was apparently unavailable).
