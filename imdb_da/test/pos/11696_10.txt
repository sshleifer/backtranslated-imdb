Crackerjack is a fun movie, everyone at bowlo has seen it, and everyone says the same. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, also the loudspeaker "dear sir So and so you have left you real indicator". Or when Jack goes home and lies down on the couch and cracks a beer, "bowls are hard work" blew me up. And when his roommate shows interest in joining the club and calling bingo numbers. Jack buys all raffle tickets to win the meat tray. Bloody big movie if you are in lawn bowls that you can relate to, if your not a lawn pleases it, I think. Evans Head Bowlo would consider the best club in Aus, friendly people, good company. He's to Evans Head Bowlo Steve
