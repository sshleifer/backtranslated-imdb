This is one of the very few films that are so overwhelming that you very likely do not see it more than once or twice in your lifetime (other examples are Claude Lanzmann's documentary Shoah and Come and See by the director's husband Elem Klimov - which covers much the same unbearable area, but in a very different way). I assume that it just as well has had trouble seeing a print. It is seemingly exceptionally overtly Christian symbolism and the admission that there were active Russian collaborators, made sure that it was hardly ever seen in the Soviet Union - and of course post-Soviet Russia has very little interest in film during that time. <br /> <br /> The one time I saw it in London was at a festival of Russian films that was shown under the Glasnost era (ie, probably c.1988) - but it has apparently been shown several times in Britain recently, so there must be at least one subtitle here. <Br /> <br /> As far as I know, it has never been released it is west on DVD or video, so if you haven't seen it, your best bet is likely to join a movie community and endlessly gnaw them to find a print and screen it.
