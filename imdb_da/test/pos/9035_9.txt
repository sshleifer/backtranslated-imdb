Intruder in the Dust (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> Production: MGM <br /> Excellent "South Gothic" story, adapted from the Faulkner novel about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man who asks a young white boy, he befriended helping him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is something of an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the country he lives on and does not think much of the sick social order, which mostly holds peace here and in many similar small towns. So when Lucas is found to hold a gun over Vinson Gowrie's death, no one shot back, fearing young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas once rescued after Chick fell through the ice while chasing his land) fear for the city to finally have the chance to "make Lucas a *****." Arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through, when Lucas out to Chick for help, as the only one he knows "not the mess of beliefs". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas, and while the man is initially alarmed by his own beliefs, he advocates it, and they are fighting against the unifying mob to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The movie has an unusual frenzy for its time and is mostly free of moralization. The lawyer's tendency tends to speak incredibly self-conscious dialogue that resembles most as something from the printed page, but it has minimal influence on the tone. It is a credit for the rich characterization of everyone else. Juano Hernandez, who had mostly appeared in Oscar Micheaux films, is amazing as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the murdered father's father, perhaps the best role I have ever seen him in, and Elizabeth Patterson as a beautiful old lady sympathetic to Lucas's case, stands in support roles. The setting is perfectly realized. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner hometown. Brown also uses the crowd effectively, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like Lucas when he is arrested or John when he goes to his office), it's very threatening. Or the whole big city's big school is gathered at the prison to witness the lynching as if it were a parade. Of note is an absolutely easy-going scene when Chick and his friend Aleck try to gather evidence at a cemetery. Robert Surtees (the bad and the beautiful, thirty seconds over TOKYO, Ben-HUR) shot the picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of 4
