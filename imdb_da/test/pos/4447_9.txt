What a surprise this movie was. I've seen a good pair of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and were surprised it was by the same director. He also wrote the play, which shows that the chap was completely capable of making a detailed, complex storyline. The headline on this one is not good, but far from the scary slop that only stops the way you like "Manhattan Baby". <br /> <br /> Shooting in this movie is amazing. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film, focusing on a small town where young boys are murdered. A scene that involves beating a woman is uncomfortable to see, but refreshing to the usual cinema violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong with Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest that he had reached his peak with this movie, and it went downhill slowly after that.
