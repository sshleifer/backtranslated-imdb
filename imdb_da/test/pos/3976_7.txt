I saw the trailer and read some reviews and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit off-beat, everyone in the making of this movie drawn by a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. Writing and jokes are far more literary than I expected. Even better, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job. All the main reasons. I'd like to see the movie Justin Long and Lewis Black. Lang is from "Ed" and the new Apple computer ads. He just came into his own as an actor in "Ed" and he was excellent here. He is a natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not pull. He's on The Daily Show at Comedy Central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in HBO's "Red, White and Screw." I catch him regularly on XM Radio's uncircumcised comedy channel. Give black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his rants and lines are written or improvised here, it doesn't matter. He is invaluable in delivering his thoughts on the middle class anxiety. One thing about Black's delivery, his gestures are not a comedian. It just seems that he has a conversation with you, and I think that makes it unconsciously more effective.
