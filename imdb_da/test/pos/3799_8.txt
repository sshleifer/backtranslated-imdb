I watched this movie on Sennat TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I die to see it again sometime before I ... yes ... you know it. The interaction between the protagonists of Tiger (Eli Wallach) "catches" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely fun. Charles Nelson Reilly's depiction of a neurotic university dean (?) Or head of department is invaluable. How many movies can you mention that are able to illuminate the struggle of humanity for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from start to finish? This film reminds us that we are all in the same match regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene in the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attack the few small weeds that have dared to show up overnight on his perfect manicure lawn!
