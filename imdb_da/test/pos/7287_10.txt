I absolutely loved this movie! It's my first favorite. Even if there were a few flaws (which movie is not wrong)? This film was very well-written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very genuine and trustworthy. They made all the characters fit into a particular role. I think the most visible thing about "Here On Earth" was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie. It's not one of those movies where you just can't relate to anything, because there are situations that everyone is or has been in. There are so many different things in this movie that it's hard not to relate to to it. I'm just 18 years old and I can even relate to it. It was heart warming and wrenching at the same time. "Here on Earth" makes you laugh, cry and sometimes angry. I give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
