Rosie Perez is the leader in this very exciting affair, throwing as Mercedes, a young Brooklyn woman who has decided to become a movie actress, although she is not favored by her circumstances living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a number of fruitless auditions for any kind of part at all. Mercedes has joined a married and rinsed actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel) who at one time had performed in a television western series in the 1970s and rarely since, accepting him as his lover, partly from loneliness, and also from a hope that movie models come on the road because of his "contacts", but the latter are of little importance, since Harry is simply confusing in his attempt to restore what he perceives as former film consciousness. To be able to provide adequate financial support, Mercedes drives as a taxi dancer in a downtown Los Angeles Skid Row dance / bar while continuing to make efforts to succeed in the movie business, and that's there at the Dancing House Young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her, and most of the story portrays his efforts to please the subject of his emotions, even though they may mean losing her altogether. This traditional rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget despite the presence of a good number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was held in the can for about a year before it was rather desultant distribution and launch marketing efforts on its behalf. It is more a shame as its solid production characteristics are fully complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirable controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work and exhibited in this film from his very open stage, framing a fitting behind the credits, featuring Perez at Skid Rows fifth and main streets. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he works very closely with his throws, and this is the case when he gives his actors the opportunity to create their roles, while some ad libbing gets exactly through the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director, despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators. The film's score is aesthetically spot on with much of what is contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as the band head of taxi dancers. Accompanying honors here must go to the eternally important Perez, although nary a sub-par performance is beaten. A fair test for the film's quality is given when a viewer will see it twice within a short period of time. Sitting through this underrated work will be considered a great pleasure for many.
