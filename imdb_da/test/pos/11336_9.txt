Having seen many of Wong Kar-Wai's other films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect to come into the theater; The cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the play would be great, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an infinite loneliness. It is precisely the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I didn't expect was the degree I was drawn on in a movie that some reviewers dismissed as "unfinished" and forced by signs that "seemed consumed by ennui." <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can be so completely untouched by a movie that so vividly exhibits emotions and settings that many of us take for granted or work joyfully to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief due to being betrayed; The blame was awakened by the idea of ​​not being better than the fraudster; the everyday but deeply intimate moments of relationships where the need to express themselves is completely superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai is trying to portray in the movie and what he achieves as well. For many Americans are consumed by the need to get every moment of a movie filled with stock dialogue; Witty dandruff, unpleasant sarcasm and overwhelmed confessions seem to be the top of the "best" American movie has to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needing to keep the audience informed of her every sense, perception or belief, Wong's characters make their feelings and understandings clearly known by facial movements, body positioning and yes silence. <br /> <br /> If viewers only consider this movie based on character development and action, then they may be disappointed with what it has to offer. If they are willing to try to intuit, what the characters feel, then they may feel completely different about what Wong has to offer them.
