This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series provides the best historical representation of dinosaurs I've ever seen. The 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe that you have traveled back in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series as well as Tim Haines, who should have spent a lot of time getting this series to fly.
