If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before the following, all the errors in the following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan designed the switches in time perfectly. We could tell when it was past when it is current, etc. However, Nolan experimented a little with it, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is a way Memento worked), it was just too difficult to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after seeing it, so hopefully it would be more sensible, but of course it didn't work. <br /> <br /> You can't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who is especially interested in him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them. Then comes a cute young blonde (Lucy Russell) in and the movie becomes even more than that. <br /> <br /> The end of the following is one of the most shocking conclusions I've seen. Certainly, Fight Club had a great ending, but the way that Following's ending played out was fantastic. I felt that someone had tasted me on the head and gave me a concussion. Nolan has one thing to make good conclusions (well maybe not, I could guess insomnia from a mile away) and can really construct a great story. The following may not be the easiest to follow or watch, but it is such a finely crafted original story with a shocking conclusion that you will probably see all its 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> Rated R for language and some violence.
