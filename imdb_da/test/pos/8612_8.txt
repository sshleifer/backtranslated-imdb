It is especially difficult for a director to capture film production without becoming valuable, inbred, over-dramatic or all three. Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-brain methods of a female author in extracting from two "cattle" (as Hitchcock called actors) a love scene of hurtful intimacy. Her biggest fight is with her leading man ("an actor is really a woman" she opines), though of course it is the leading lady who wants to steal the show. I disagree that this is Breillat's first comedy. 'Romance' was fun at various points, but I accept that the French sense of humor may be unclear to foreigners; In fact, dozens of IMDb reviewers did not record any comedy in Romance. In contrast, sex, comedy is full of laughs, primarily by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We wondered about leaving the theater if Roxane's "beard" was a wig. A lovely performance from Anne Parillaud as Breillat breaks down with her own script and looks ten years younger than her age.
