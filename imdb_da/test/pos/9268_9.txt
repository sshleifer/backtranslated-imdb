I watched this documentary at the 2005 Slamdance Independent Film Festival. This documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's annual fight with cancer. The shot in a year "The closer she gets", is a documentary in the right shape and gives you an interior look of a family's struggle to fight the cancer, the viewer gets an inside view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the process. I have never seen such an honest movie, it is a powerful and raw movie, and as it was not shot by an outsider, you get the true feelings of everyone involved. Many documentaries are shot by an outsider, but because this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film, as opposed to what I have previously seen on this topic or others. This is a moving story that everyone should see and relate to. I would highly recommend it.
