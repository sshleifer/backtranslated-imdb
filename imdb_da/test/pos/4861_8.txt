First, they came to the Communists, and I did not speak because I was not a Communist. Then they came to the Jews, and I did not speak, for I was not a Jew. Then they came to the Catholics, and I did not speak, for I was a Protestant. Then they came to me, and then there was no one left to speak for me. <br /> <br /> Attributed to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of contempt. But when will it be too much? Global anti-Semitic feelings allowed Hitler's genocide policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear and ignorance made it possible for McCarthyism's anti-communist cleansing to destroy thousands of people's lives. Lack of action makes it no less criminal. Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: quietly and indefinitely, he blends seamlessly with his surroundings. Lawrence doesn't like being involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business. His world spirals in chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is wrong for one of them. Lawrence's view of the world and its view of him has changed forever. <br /> <br /> Although the subject of this movie is not new, its presentation is absolutely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of the past when placed within a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned about the assumption that he is Jewish than he is with his attackers' views. He believes that if he corrects this "surveillance" everything will be okay, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether I play a twilight (the only thing I liked about "Fargo") or a down-to-shine lighthouse sheriff is William H. Macy's roles associated with a common thread - his character shares a subtle, deliberate face that gives them fabric. Macy's nails Lawrence down to the last detail and says more with a furtive look or tremble in her voice than a page of dialogue. By showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is able to share his fear and confusion with the viewer. The supportive shock brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is convincing as Gerty, Lawrence's bombshell wife with past. Trailer Park Rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of anger as a result of "a mistake" and inadvertently aggravating Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is scary as Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, just sharing ignorance and poison that gathers neighbors to his virulent cause. In the midst of the chaos, Finchestein (David Paymer) is the focus of aggression and the voice of reasoning raises the important issues. Paymer's just-handed depiction keeps Finklestein capable of becoming a stereotype or a person whose sole purpose is to create sympathy, making his one of the strongest performances in the film. The tight editing and cutting technology make it a clean image with few distractions, and blending an air of claustrophobia into the small town of America feels - at the same time comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of hard two-tone illumination to highlight the malicious aspects of the play and the carefully scored soundtrack is powerful without being overwhelming. Finally, set and costume design restores the era's feel, an important component of the movie's message. <br /> <br /> "Focus" "Unconventional approach to dealing with prejudice is enough to recommend this movie. Just think of the great story, solid acting and appearance of the movie as extra bonuses.
