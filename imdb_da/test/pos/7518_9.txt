Anyone going to the Manhattan Hospital Center takes his life in his hands. It includes the staff at the hospital. <br /> <br /> I had never seen the hospital before and I was fascinated by how similar signs and situations of the plot were to the second Paddy Chayefsky Masterpiece, Network. There are elements of George C. Scott's character that have both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of the hospital and he is sour as hell and will not take it anymore. He is completely alienated from his wife and children. It takes a Faye Dunaway typist in Diana Riggs person to get him out of it. You roll in the hay with her, and he is shocked back to the reality and the fact that he can still contribute in the world. <br /> <br /> But first, he has a real problem. Someone is killing hospital staff, four of them in a 48-hour period. And the good part is that their deaths are due to a large part of the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. This is where the comedy comes in. There is an actual Howard Beale-type character with Barnard Hughes, Diana Riggs father. His end is not quite as dramatic as Beale's. <br /> <br /> Paying for medical suppliers was part of my job. Some of them could be as large creeps as you would find portrayed in the hospital. The black comedy satir had something really bite for it for me. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but he won and refused to accept the previous year's Oscar for Patton, but he wasn't about to get another chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Yet his handling of the role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to see the hospital back to back with the network and see how many similarities you see.
