As with many of Wong's films, many people find them boring and confusing. Well I like them and I also like this movie. I went out and rented it on DVD and I watched it 3 times. It's a very subtle movie that gives an intoxicating experience. for those who do not enjoy it ...... you just wasted 2 hours in your life .... too bad ... muhahahahaha.
