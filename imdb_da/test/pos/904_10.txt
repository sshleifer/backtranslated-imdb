Genius or complete madness? It depends on your interpretation of this movie. I responded to it on a par with a self-confident "cop-movie parody" and I sincerely hope it was meant to be because I can't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to chew up in nature and really get into the spirit of things! Should this movie mark a departure for Rudd from its core background in the comedy genre? Something insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I do not think! <br /> <br /> With the cheesy, almost awkward play, low budget FX and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it simply evoked the old TV show "Sledge Hammer" for me! HYSTERIC FUN !!! :-) <br /> Of course, I might have completely interpreted the movie incorrectly. If it was actually an attempt at a "straight" action movie, then it was definitely a fun mistake !! <br /> <br /> Look with lots of alcohol and some friends! ;-)
