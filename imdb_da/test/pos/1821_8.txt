I really liked this movie, it reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is fantastic. I'm a great nic cage fan and this is my favorite movie he is in. I love the story, it's a total love story against the odds kind of thing. I think everyone who graduated in the early 80s (1980-1984) should see the film. It brought back the memory of high school for me.
