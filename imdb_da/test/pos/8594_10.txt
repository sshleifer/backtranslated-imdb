I feel very lucky to have the chance not only to watch this movie but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an excellent portrayal that gives a full sense of history without falling into the usual Hollywood staircases - yes, he is shown to his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the ever-growing self Congo. The film is made excellent, moving together at a pace that is consistently engaging. I'm looking forward to see other Raoul Peck movies, and more from Eric Ebouaney!
