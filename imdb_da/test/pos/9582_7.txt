Long before Terri Schiavo brought the issue of living as a "vegetable" to the public, "One day in Joe Egg's death" treated it. Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely brindled. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) are trying every kind of dark humor to try to get on with their lives, but they cannot escape the facts. At some point they are even considering euthanasia. The question of them and their friends is: What will ever be this difficulty? <br /> <br /> With this movie, Alan Bates continued his strip of great movies, ahead of "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can safely say that he will be disappointed missing.
