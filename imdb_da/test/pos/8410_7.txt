<br /> <br /> It's widely known and has been said before: Nobody can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer who has been divorced from former hubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett, and although this is a successor and not a re-husband (God forbidden!), She still cannot rise to the occasion ( ie her voice sounds bad on several occasions, she has brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not for the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle, therefore she has a incredible talent for flirting (as she did in the SCARLETT novel and GWTW of course) and to be a nice flirt as Scarlett is, you would probably need a higher tone like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I assume that I compare Kilmer with Leigh a little too much, but when someone has a role as masterful as Leigh did with Scarlett, you can simply help criticize new potential Scarletts, Timothy Dalton should not have had any accent whatsoever, round off the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in fi I had none. His plays have never been really remarkable (except perhaps his depiction of the evil, watching King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett. Standouts in the cast are especially Tina Kellagher (a born actress with lots of authenticity in her release) as the tragic victim of Mary Boyle. And then of course there is Sean Bean as cold, calculation and not to mention, almost demonic evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's possible violator. One thing I could not forgive the author was that Scarlett was raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and scary among the Irish in the book, but he is not as close as heartless as his A second omission from the novel, but read to the movie is Belle Watling's character, which played most horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role that we could all have lived without seeing how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any help from Mrs watling. <br /> <br /> For a movie in itself, scarlett is a very good one, but not quite in the height of a place of winning actresses were very much needed for Scarlett as well as Rhett. <br /> <br />
