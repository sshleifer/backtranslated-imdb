The trio is a pleasant nostalgic journey to the first hint of desire - when it was still about simple exploration of the unknown - before we grew up and added the complexities of HIV status, emotional baggage and gotta-run-min-pager-just - went-off in the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anxiety portrayed is pure youth fear, but it does sound right in all three stories. Their sweetness and positivity make you happy that you are gay. And those kinds of movies are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Good News! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now easily accessible on DVD from September 1999.
