This movie is very stupid and very fun. You can never criticize it for taking seriously. If you've heard their previous album or watched their HBO videos from the album, imagine the extremely horrible, rocking good time that is this movie that tells the fate of how the Tenacious D group was formed. <Br /> <br /> Full of comos, it not only provides a fictional account of Tenacious D, but is also a send-up of musical history. Humor is reminiscent of Mary, because they often "go places you would think they wouldn't", but it lacks the scatological humor in South Park. This film contains no nudity except mooning.
