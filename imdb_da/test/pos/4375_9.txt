Mr. Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after he went to the hospital for chest pain (he had a history of heart problems). The media and cartoons covered the loss everywhere more than I or he would ever have expected ... but he was the grandfather of the observation comedy. This recording was his last production and includes a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. Filtering the project took place shortly after his seventeenth birthday, which he was happy to have reached (observed?). I have followed Carl's career from the day with fuzzy black and white TV and enjoyed his current album. <br /> <br /> It is a privilege for any Carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. He was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70! As he would say ,,, he is NOT "smiling down from heaven on you". If he does anything at all, he does not teach harp; maybe he looks up !!!
