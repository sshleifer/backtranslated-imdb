This is a brilliant, sumptuous Czech movie from Sveraks father and sister team, all about two Czech pilots flying to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain, but also falling over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Have some excellent and incredibly realistic air combat scenes ?? probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the movie Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, companionship, loss and seriousness. Also the trials and hardships of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier here with the great stalwart Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice little motifs like the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown all over and at some point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record spinning around cutely (music is another theme of the movie, of course ). Plus, all the traditional icons in English life: pounded beer glasses (as opposed to the post-war glass glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in a fine Chinese tea set in an English country garden (though it is shot in the Czech Republic?) , mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, the aerodrome and the surrounding countryside are ridiculous, unlike anywhere in the South of England, though the virtuouso-air sequences represent this. blow. But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer, but all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin, who scored the original Battle of Britain movie among other classic English war films. There is even a good little cameo role for ?? apparently ?? the famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays the piano title song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! <br /> <br /> It has few smutty but fun little freudian units that always show an inflated condom floating at the ceiling when Karel (the cluster but brilliant Krystof Hadek) sticks to the airfield while his love competitor and co-pilot Pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Recommended and worth seeing / hiring ?? get the DVD with special features (things like how they created dog fighting and things). Probably the only movie ever to combine subtitles with characters that speak English, German, French and Czech at once.
