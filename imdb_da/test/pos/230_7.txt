To be brief, the story is paper-thin, and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an impossible young Phil Silvers keep the film flowing all the way through and at times lifting it all up in the air. Some of the songs are horrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train wreck), but most of them are fun, and Hayworth's scenes on the absurdly large set for Kelly's rival must be seen as believed. Another treat is the perfect faux-NYC set in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the scary horrible male "chivalry" against women. The oily clay and transparent obsequiousness that consisted of male charm is then (in the films, at least) presented in the most shabby form here. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> One minor disappointment is that Eve Arden is caught in a role so small that she hardly has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
