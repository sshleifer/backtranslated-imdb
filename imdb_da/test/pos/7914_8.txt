When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder, Detective Carrella seeks the city for her murderer. Identifying the killer after an intensive manhunt is sent to Patricia to live with relatives in the country. For Carrella, the case is closed ... or is it? "Blood relatives" is an overlooked masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a policeman and it is nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a children's master. The conclusion is quite disturbing. Quiet "blood related" is more a mystery than a horror movie, so fans of gore are disappointed. A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.
