To understand the "Crash Course" in the right context, understand the 80s on television. Most TV shows had no point. Sitcomet expanded the drama at least 3 to 1. They were still finding out where the lines were so they could cross them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" were the bold move!) This TV movie "Crash Course" was an All Star cast that gathers members from all 80s classics: "227", "Family Slips "," Who is the boss "? Et al. Directors must have had some love for them all-star movies then. Nevertheless, this film offered very light fare and a simplified notion of heroism and maturity. And it's not bad sometimes. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
