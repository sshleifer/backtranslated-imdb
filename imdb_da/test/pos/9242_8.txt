I've seen this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a few days ago. Punk! All and everything involved in the movie is added to the bad. The music, of course. But the film itself captured the whole punk genre. Even a grandmother and schoolteacher (me) can appreciate artists who are able to make their ideas a reality (good, reality, film-wise). This film takes a handful of crossed-out filmmakers and clearly and wisely shows that "why" of their fear of not getting the green light to complete the Waldo movie. The (relatively) happy girl gave good comic relief, a good respite from the continued (but understandable) ragging on the guy who left them. Perhaps Stu loves, though. And be sure to see / read the credits - they are the icing on the cake!
