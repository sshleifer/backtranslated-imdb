I recently purchased this on DVD, which I had not heard of it and as Robert Carlyle. Of course, this movie won't have Hollywood special effects, saying that although the special effects were decent enough and the play was fine too. I found the movie to be entertaining and do not regret buying it at all. In almost 2 hours, it's just the right length for this type of movie. Don't expect exciting explosive action from the beginning to the end, but it's a pretty balanced movie with a decent enough story!
