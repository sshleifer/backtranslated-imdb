I've seen several Yul Brynner films - but it's his best performance as the camera captures his emotions close to him as he laces, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have been just as arrested in ten bids, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov and The Mad Woman of Chaillot, but none of these films has captured his talent range in close-ups as in this one. He arrests and counts to see in every shot. <br /> <br /> Just as fascinating and sexy, without removing clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The scripture allows her to radiate a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive - she reprized this kind of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help the group's release from the Russian coups, in fact she turns out to run away from the Russian major (as opposed to the Maupassant story or the Isaac Denisen story). Still, the film looks with the proposed but real physical characteristics of the Kerr character. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress, but she is a great actress. She puts her soul in the dignity of the characters she portrays that often collide with the character of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey, Quo Vadis and Iguana night memorable. Why is this an unusual movie? It's not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again a major cinema by Abraham Polonsky, but was never recognized as such because of the intolerance of left-wingers in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its casting - fantastic French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr. and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is international than American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denis find that the film is not really for any work. Nevertheless, the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) Version has a dignified charm of its own - provided the reality of the night that led to the group's release. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in giving an interesting and plausible twist to the stories that led to the film production, while mixing the pieces of both written stories (eg the last bus tour and the final kiss) < br /> <br /> But I have a grouse - why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (eg, insomnia), the original works have begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.
