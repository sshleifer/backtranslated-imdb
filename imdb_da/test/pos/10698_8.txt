I have always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go beyond that. In "Ninja III" it is fun scary and exciting. A ninja is shot by the police and uses his spirit for revenge. The victim, a lovely young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls for the policeman who was involved in the shooting. The love scene where she throws V8 on her body knocked me out! The death of the ninja becomes aware of another in Japan called Yamada (Sho Kosugi). He comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. Simply because he left Yamada left eye with a shuriken (throwing star). Fighting scenes were excellent. I liked the part when plywood falls on Yamada and he shares it with his foot. And when he was caught, he tells that officer Christie was involved in it, everything would be fine. Rule of thumb: Never under estimate a ninja. He took the other police out without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie did his best to put the ninja in his place to use her for a raising tool. It was a great movie, great for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!
