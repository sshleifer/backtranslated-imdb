Movies seem to fall into two categories: movies that reinforce existing societal values ​​and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This movie is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offers such as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets", which look more like Disney fantasies in comparison. "Apocalypse now!" project, production and resulting films, "Heart of Darkness" is updated to a post-modernist psychological horror story in the late 20th century. The support and crew that worked on it could probably relate to the frightening places the human mind can achieve. This is the situation of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz, who came to literary being in 1901 and subsequently referred to in TS Eliot's "The Hollow Men" (Mistah Kurtz, he died) from 1925. Although not a straight story of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness "(1901) nor a first-time description of Vietnam's experience," Apocalypse Now! " stands as a masterpiece that pushed on the envelope with film potential. "Apocalypse" is not just about the "atrocities" of the war as "Plato" and "the deer hunter", but the darker sensibility of human nature as revealed by the rapid and degrading confrontations of violent conflict on mass scale. Apocalypse now! is not as much seen as experienced. Most of the film is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a turn-the-force performance) aboard an American military boat crossing a named river in the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few Western people will ever step down. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army, the Special Forces Division Officer, who was the US military treasure until he went AWOL and dismissed the deep, unknown jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the Colonel has gone crazy, but as events unfold, something else has happened to him that is far more frightening than just insane. Sheen's mission is to end the Colonel with the American public, no wiser. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty episodic. The journey along the river consists of several vignettes such as Sheen and his crew encounter various independent "aspects" of the war on earth. American audiences from the 1970s had probably never seen this kind of film production before, with the possible exception for "Deer Hunter" released in the previous year. The first and one of the most notable is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar nominated performance), which is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves playing "Ralk of Valkyries" from Wagner's "The Ring" when he bombs helpless villages. His line "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning" is one of the often cited lines from the annals of the cinema. Other meetings include an amphitheater, where individuals will be entertained by people like Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production disasters that prevented this shooting in the can, the notable aspect of this movie is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) makes a fine of building tasks until the viewer is emotionally prepared to cope with the climatic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some shots from both Sheen and Brando in some places are some of the strongest and scary images ever produced on film. Not even as Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola with regard to horrible pictures. Brando's Kurtz on a scene in particular is so terrifying that most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the realization that horror is not from without but from within. Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climatic moment is one of the most innovative cinematic revelations. According to the documentary film "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would be lost in the melodrama, and the atmosphere of the darker shades of the film would be compromised. He was not sure how he could make it work until his wife urged the director to witness a ceremonial sacrifice of an ox practiced by the natives Coppola used as an option in the scenes with Kurtz in his "village" . After viewing, Coppola had its end, and it is one of the most disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American filmmakers. Love it or hate it. No Western viewer will be the same after watching this scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for every taste, as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It is not only the violence and the meaningless violence that is difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It is the naked disclosure of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from the US suburbs that make this movie difficult for the average movie maker to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola didn't make a family picture. But if the viewer can understand his greater point, there is much to come out of Apocalypse Now! If you're looking for a movie experience to confirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensitivity and heroism, stay closer to John Wayne. But if you are willing to be taken to places you have never been, even the "wicked" rhetoric of war, "Apocalypse Now" will take you into a world you thought you had never visited before and the disturbing part of That is, you might recognize it.
