This is another of the rare films you feel grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual Hollywood trip. It is really a roller coaster ride as we follow the effects of a forged 500 Euro note on a wide range of people. One asks 'what if' all the time, but it is certainly a butterfly effect captured on film. It makes you laugh, cry and bite your lip. I loved every minute of it! And thank you SBS Australia for showing movies that are really entertaining, even worth trying to read the subtitles. The only drawback in my heart is that I don't want to book a holiday for the frozen country - they all seem to be too depressed - to be all the cold weather. Either way, see it - it's worth every second.
