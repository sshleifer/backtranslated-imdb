Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980s, I was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. It wasn't just Bogart he was obsessed with; But the whole era of the old flicks of my age knows so well. In addition, a plot resembles the Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters interact with Sacchi - and you have a work of art as far as I'm concerned. About ten years later, it appeared on television, and I lost it. >
