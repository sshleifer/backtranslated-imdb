Great film! The soundtrack is amazing! Very relaxing sound. Elton was back in 1971 before his own time. Lewis Gilbert did a great job of producing and managing this movie! The film was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The soundtracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie on a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "In Meant To Do My Work Today" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved in this amazing movie! It was not surprising that many of those involved in this movie continued to be the best in their field.
