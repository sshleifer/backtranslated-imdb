Although Flatliners is 15 years old, tonight was my first time ever to see it. I had heard about the movie Flatliners, but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point of seeing that period. Well, I caught it on one of the premium channels and I have to say it was very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was about some brilliant young medical students who decided to explore death. They have found a way to make a person die short and bring him / her back to life. Besides the all-star cast, this movie had some serious bite to it. Just the very thought of exploring death is raging enough, but I really thought the author and the director did an excellent job of giving another, yet hairy, one. This was not a generic attempt at excitement, scare and make one's mind race ... this was the right deal. <br /> <br /> Instead of turning it into an empty superficial star-loaded thriller, this film had substance. A nail bite, white bone, edge-by-seat, hard nose thriller. I give it an 8/10.
