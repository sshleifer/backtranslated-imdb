A cleverly directed movie by Martin Ritt, where a drive and anti-hero, John Cassevete lands in NY to escape a tragic event in his life, killing his brother in a car accident and leaving AWOL from the army. <Br /> <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grin in his depiction of a movie. Is surprised that Montgomery Clift did not get this part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, Sidney Poitier turns as the two work on the docks. Immediately Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this movie, seems to be against him, and the tragedy follows when Poitier tries to defend his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee plays Poitiers wife in this movie and is brilliant in a scene where she invites Cassavetes to reveal her mother's killer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting movie of moral values ​​and loneliness in society. Based on the lease, the right mood is depicted in the film.
