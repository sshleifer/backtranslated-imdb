comeundone, i love you! I couldn't come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it ends. My family hasn't seen this movie yet, but I also know them well; They will hate it. But this time I saw it alone and I found out that it was of great importance to me. Although the film is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed at the end. Initially, I thought it was strange how she just disappeared, but at some level it makes perfect sense. But as a comundone said, this movie doesn't make sense of reality. Instead, it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you insight into thinking about what the end means, I can say I loved how it turned out, and I love Mithi.
