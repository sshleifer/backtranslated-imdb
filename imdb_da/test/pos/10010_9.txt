I first saw this movie at IFC. Which is a good network by the way of watching underground movies. I saw this movie and thought it would be pure drama and a story line that didn't hold water. But it was really worth a visit. The main character is in such a rough form and you hate to see him deny help, but whatever you just can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is also amazing. At times, you feel that you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more or not like a loophole in the plot. There are no loopholes (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies that are being made so bad in America. I really enjoy the foreign settings because I feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand another culture. This movie did all the things to me and more. Please see this movie and if you are new to foreign films, this is a good start.
