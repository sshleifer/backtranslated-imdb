* THIS COMMENT WILL Reasonably Have SPOILERS !! I checked SPOILERS BOX just in case, but it couldn't have SPOILERS, but be aware if I say something that you might consider a spoiler and I don't! * Wow ... best game since Super Mario 64. I got this game the first day it came out and before I got it, I went to some game sites to look at its ratings (yes, they have already reviewed it before it came out) and I was shocked. I expected something like Sunshine, because in the end all the Mario games have been worse and worse. But this one completely beats the other games. The scorers of this game even beat Halo 3! It is simply amazing. STORY: Not the best thing Mario games are never known for their plots, and this is not much of a difference. Bowser kidnapped peach again, but this time invading the fungus at a festival celebrated once a century and getting a flying saucer, and it shoots lasers on the ground, and then they put the anchors in the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation in outer space . <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely great, the best graphics on the Wii so far. The water effects are also really good if you ever see the water, it looks right from the effects they put into it. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Just amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. Not all that, but even those who are not orchestrated still sound very good. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very entertaining, wanting to play more and more, and for me, since I tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot, I mean, I'm definitely not the one the only thing, but this game for me did not have much. Now it's still kind of, but not to the point like Mario 64, where I totally get lost and end up turning off the game because it made me angry, it never did. <br /> <br /> PROGRESS: There are two types of difficulty because you can only beat the technique with only 60 stars, which I think is easy, but to beat the game 100%, you must get 120 as always, and The quest is much harder, but still very fun. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, absolutely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to beat it with only 60 stars, but 120 took me more than 45-50 hours. Now I have not played it all so much, I played a lot a day so the next few days just a few hours each day, so the next two days I played it all day. For me, however, I think the search for 60 stars was a little short so if you want a long game, I suggest getting them all. PRESENTATION: Now the biographical scenes in this movie are excellent. How they are, it just looks like something I wanted to see in the theaters. They are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: This game is definitely a great game and I advise you not to wait for Christmas, get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you have some sidescroller levels where you move from side to side, or up and down, because they change in gravity, but even if the music has some old classics in it. So this game seems like a masterpiece. For me, it's my favorite Mario game all the time, but others may disagree. But it's still a good game. I recommend to all players who want to have fun in a game to get this.
