I just watched this movie again, I believe in the sixth time. I will undoubtedly see it many more times. This is one of the most amazing French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, it is even more mysterious what happened to the author and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he hasn't made another movie, and that was his only movie. The story and performance of this brilliant film is perfect, and it is clearly paying tribute to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where a side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior' and he is only killed by inches. In this movie, people bend and pass on and pass each other unawares, and if they had been a second away, they would have collided. The story goes so much that you can't take your eyes off the screen for another millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole movie has the same eerie quality, but while Hitchcock had a woman, two women, Mimouni has two women a woman and thereby invert plot structure. Reference is made to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo', which is central to the inspiration of this movie. The theme may seem superficial to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the wallpaper, the inevitable. Everything is crowded with passionate love and desire, but the desire exceeds its purpose and fights something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easy to transfer from Lisa to Alice, when it is realized that it is Alice that is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly illuminates the eternal mystery. The film is ultimately 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty while Bohringer is what the English call "plain". However, at this early stage, Romane Bohringer had more than mastered the art of "personality domination", whereby beautiful girls fall by the way and are not noticed because Romane is so fascinating that you cannot take her eyes long enough to look at the beautiful girls, and you only end up thinking about her. Most of us remember I'm sure her father Richard Bohringer is in a bathtub listening to opera in the movie 'Diva' many years ago. I'd rather see Roman than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating because Richard Bohringer is also spell binding, and he's not even a woman. Romane looks like she's becoming Anna Magnani when she's much older, and that means she'll get an Oscar if anyone can only write another 'Rose Tattoo' to her. The girl has so much passion inside her that she could set fire to the Seine. Wouldn't it be great if she and Julie Delpy got together? This movie made wonderful use of Paris places. But where is this 'place in Luxembourg'? It looked like Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the movie six more times just to study the accuracy of the timing and who brushes past who, and make sure I'm right. It's all like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games that are blindfolded by a grandmaster. How exciting it is! Romane, you can see through my window anytime! Mimouni, move on, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihoods, coincidence, synchronism, everything that goes on, is invisible and how it affects the visible. And once again we have here the Breton novel 'Nadja' spirit, crafted in a good French work of art. More! More! More!
