I haven't seen "Hardware Wars" this year, but I remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience, and it was far too early. Every aspect of this movie was fun, and it was even better than "Star Wars". I laughed. I cried. After seeing it, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars so I could kiss that goodbye (I'm talking about the last one). I love it when Ham Salad's side kick / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon buns, and the Darph Nader character is just fun! This movie would be great to watch back-to-back with "Thumb Wars" and I would sincerely wish there could have been a "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Umpire Strikes Out." (Was there?)
