After my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried 20 minutes of training and I was hooked. I lost about 50 lbs. It was the greatest weight I have ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. It would be a blessing if you started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included 20 minutes of training. I think it was the best training video ever made. I wish I could buy it somehow. The routine was easy to learn and you worked a little sweat. The training hours they have today are too complicated and too difficult to learn. Please do your best to get this video back in circulation. I pray, it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
