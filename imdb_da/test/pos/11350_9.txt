Two people living in the same flat complex find that their partners have an affair with each other. As they try to merge what happened, they also go on an emotional journey that makes it a decision. <br /> <br /> Based on his past success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old-fashioned and marvelous story of revived passion, longing and untouched love. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the mood of love is not for everyone's taste. It wanders quite warmly at 98mins: not very long after a movie, but it looks longer because there is not much happening. But this lazy feeling hides a rather heavily constructed film. Most of the story is cunningly woven around a set of role-playing games, where the characters behave suspected scenarios between their respective spouses and try to figure out how the case started. I say cleverly because it obviously makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is "in-roll" and what is genuine. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds rather artificial and self-conscious, it's because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong's finest, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with an excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai who treats the audience to a sensory and sensual overload. Along with Christopher Doyle (who later propagated his lush, arrogant style of Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully underestimated style can be seen in spring in a small town), it was cinematic genius. It has the whole of Doyle's bold beauty, with no respect, the cheesiness of the Athena poster of his work on Hero. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole sings in Spanish, to the joking strings of the main theme, it fits perfectly to the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all, a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, film or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful old-fashioned story of love that is lost and regained. <br /> <br /> Beware of Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which anticipates Wong's latest movie of the same name.
