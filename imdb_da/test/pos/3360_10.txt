Often when television shows are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical accuracy of costumes, equipment, and general art, such as the television series, is excellent. A great example of comedy and farce, with excellent script and comedy actors in the right parts. Based on a classic TV series that stands alone in British TV Comedy history.
