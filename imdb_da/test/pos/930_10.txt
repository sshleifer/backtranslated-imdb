Valentine, a model in France, is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet in England, but seems to grow more distant as the film progresses. One night after falling a passport made by her colleague, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives, and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who lives as a hermit and eavesdropper, and listens to all of the neighbors' conversations. She is fascinated by this man and often visits him and often becomes part of his eavesdropping game. A conversation that the two listen to is extremely important, but the conversation between a young, soon to be a judge and his wife, whom we find out of parallels, the life of the man who cancels them. When we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then his story continues and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. A little bit, Valentine can know how her life, this meeting and the fate of the young judge will be rooted together. Her beating dog that day seemed to be fate, a divine sacrifice of the dog for her owner, so Valentine could be the savior of the young judge traveling the same way as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a nasty future filled with with loneliness and loneliness. It seems that the old dream comes true and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An amazing finale for possibly the best trilogy all the time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of the cinema. His use of the French flags colors in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. Usually labeled with a subtle pause or late focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. I have to mention this and it's a huge SPOILER, I loved the end, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster along with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man looked at her TV, strengthens his happiness over the suffering he treated for many years. I couldn't think of a better way to finish the movie, but a smile on my face, great way to unpack a great movie and trilogy! I recommend this to ALL who love movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for both film and trilogy.
