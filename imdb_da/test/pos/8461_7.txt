Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soap-like materials. Ted Danson did his best with a unrelenting role in Chip Davis. The principle of this is that the two ladies friendship, a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticks. I found the relationship that Ted Danson's character had with the only woman Christine Lahti played quite sordid. He behaved in a caddish manner, but he left two "widows" running over him, bawling. I found it disgusting when Sandy told him that she would break it off after meeting her wife, he calls her that he misses her (he called his wife? There was no sign of it). He appeared as a heel. It might have made a more interesting movie if he had not been killed. Perhaps both ladies had wiped themselves and dumped him. I liked the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they had in common: Cad by a man.
