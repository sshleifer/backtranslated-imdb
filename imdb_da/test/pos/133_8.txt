SPOILER ALERT! Do not read further unless you are prepared for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had a lot under its shell. In addition to the apparent connections with "Oldboy" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relationship with this and also the subtle erotic theme disturbed all of the vampire's physical actions. <br /> The main actor Kang-ho Song is amazing in the priest's priest Sang-hyeon - randomly means "singing" "blood" in some languages ​​- who really loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl seems psychopathic, and the man is largely wrapped around his finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is completely different. As she moves, she is stiff, one-dimensional, and tight, but paralyzed, she says everything by not moving or looking through an eye. Park-wook really has mastered his filmography in this movie and owes much to Stanley Kubrick; There are a whole bunch of beautiful shots sprinkled throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require more gaze and probably repetitive views to fully capture. The music is quite stocked, where you mostly use strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; It is a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While doing very little and losing it, he seems to be a person who thinks a lot. While his love interest says and does much, her actions show little thought behind it. In my humble opinion. All in all, a very disturbing movie that is not made for action that is not even in the same dimension as most things about vampires these days; It is magnificent and dissuasive at the same time.
