I could never imagine I would start to love movies like this. After seeing Yimou Zhang's 'Hero' I decided to check out his other movies, maybe looking for something similar. The second Yimou Zhang movie I watched was 'No One Less', after which I realized what kind of cinema I am in. No wonder why I got 'Keep Cool' right away. It's a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I pay my respect to the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it's not the amount of money that makes movies good. It's about what the director wants to show and how successful he is about to do this. The story is very simple, a typical excerpt of a typical daily life, additionally displayed in a very simple way, and the camera's movements also enhance the impression and feel of the film. I give a top rating to this movie and impatiently wait to see other Yimou Zhang's films.
