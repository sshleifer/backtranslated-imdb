I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth, but every one of them had a hidden dark side. Kind of a mystery. David Graysmark himself was a riddle. The secret fears and just secrets in general that he had. There was a whole side of him that the other characters didn't know anything about, and it left the audience either wondering or assuming. There was always a part of this man that he would keep away, but he would also share a little with himself. He was the strong male protagonist, and I admire that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do almost any part! He is a fantastic talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him endlessly. Since this show he has gone on many other projects and has stretched his ability quite a bit more and quite well. Kudos to him and all the other actors from this show to do such a good job! I wish them all good. I wish the series would continue on! It's such a shame it didn't!
