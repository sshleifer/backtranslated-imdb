I am writing this after just watching the latest episode broadcast in the UK and it must be a hard work for me to keep up with the standard. The last episode called "Blink" has elements of gothic horror, all with statues that are not quite what they think. The doctor and Martha do not seem much, but it does not detract from a well-developed episode. The general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parties with "The Family" and the latest have been the best thing the current team has ever done. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant keeping it together, the whole offensive week of the week out helps as well. For those who are awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is worth it.
