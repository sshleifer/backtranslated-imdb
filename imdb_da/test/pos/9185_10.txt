Last night I had the remarkable pleasure of watching the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role he is not always associated with. He appeared for a time that he didn't have to hold a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always had him at "The King of Queens", but this role really brought him to the light more, and I hope to see him on the big screen much more in the near future. The movie was fun and sweet and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama left me feeling complete. It is nothing like most "chick flicks" in the form of tears and sadness, but keeps its own, and I believe can be equally enjoyed by both men and women. I urge all couples especially to watch this movie, but even if you are not involved in anyone, you can get some good ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> two ways big thumbs up !!!
