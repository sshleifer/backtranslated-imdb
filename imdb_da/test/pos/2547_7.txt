Some critics have compared the Chop Shop to the theatrical releases of God's city and Pixote. I have seen both them as well as the Chop Shop, and as in many cases I do not feel the comparison is justified. The city of God and Pixote certainly had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low-budget film about survival and hope, disappointment and continuation with life. One of the scenes is supposedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time, and the US's open footage was added. I say it because I live in the area where this movie was filmed, and security is crazy while tennis matches are underway. It is also noteworthy that the actors' actual names were the names of their characters in the film. Back to the movie. It's an enjoyable story of survival. But it ended up getting a 7 because ... at times the actors seemed very good. At other times, they just seemed to recite their lines. If the players were less competent (as they were in the low budget "The Big Dis" for example) I would have been more forgiving. But in several scenes, each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times they seemed bored. The director can be guilty of this. I also had problems with the end. This is one of the movies that "just ends". Maybe there will be part 2? Definitely worth the DVD. I don't usually summarize the story because the information is already available on IMDb.
