WONDERBIRD, surely an incredibly refined cartoon, drawn in a beautiful old fashioned way and sensationally old in almost all respects, is in a realm of a medieval and fierce monarch; Therefore, does the kingdom see, or at least what we see? about the king's palace, out to the bare, uninhabited. <br /> <br /> A few inhabitants are away from the sun in the withered underground city. <br /> <br /> A council det calls it an allegory, calling it a parable, but does not call it a fable. Because IMDb encourages prolixity and perhaps for other reasons too, I would add that this cartoon is the great Paul Grimault's work.
