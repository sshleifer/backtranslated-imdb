For me, the best and most memorable movies are often the ones that at first view do not know about. American Movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. Watching television late one night, I mocked the only good review among the dross - luckily I was in favor of a real treat. American Movie is a documentary film that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I believe), a highly articulated and charismatic Wisconson boy, as he struggles to write, rule and produce "MidWestern", a gritty low-budget Horror movie on which he has worked for years. In Mark, we discover a young man full of contrast. His appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, 80-inch heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. However, for camera, Markus shows sensational humor and insight as he philosophises for life, love, movies and American manner. As the film unfolds, it becomes obvious that Markus's lack of discipline and heavy drinking is relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. The American Movie is a charming watch filled with fun moments and vibrant characters. Chief among these is Mark's beloved buddy Mike Schank, a soft speech reformed stoner who has now conquered an addiction to scratch card, is now dependent on soda. I absolutely loved American movies. It creates real empathy between the viewer and the protagonists, and gives hilarity without feeling exhaustive. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.
