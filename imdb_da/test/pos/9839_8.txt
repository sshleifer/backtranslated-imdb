Frankie Darro was a wonderful children's actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little victories with giant chips on their shoulders. He appeared in a couple of top films from the early 30s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a groundbreaking criminal drama and the "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a current depression-ear film about children running on the rails. He was mostly a younger version of James Cagney. Although he was not very much, his willingness to make his own stunts was employed by a number of programmers, as the larger studies no longer used him. <br /> <br /> The "Crime School" should be a remake of "The Mayor of Hell", but it had much more humor in it and contained The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very casual deputy commissioner. "The Mayor's Mayor" is really a combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Although Cagney didn't look his way up until about 25 minutes, his influence (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a car wash racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate of glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reform office. It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys get the chance to learn a trade. In fact, it is a sacred place run by a sadistic host, Mr. Thompson (outstanding game of Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the living nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) has been given the job as the new Deputy Commissioner as a service. Upon his arrival at the school, he testifies to an erroneous escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy, he realizes that school needs extensive reforms. He soon goes to school and introduces a "self-government" system - rather than "Boy's Town". Although Cagney doesn't have much to do, the picture is brought together to the gripping climax of Darro's energy. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns, and his brutal treatment resulting in a boy's death ("Skinny") turns the rest the boys into an angry mob. They burn down a shed, and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" returns just in time to stop the mob with some sensible talk. Sure, all the boys seemed to get a stiff talking to for their crimes but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a "meanie". His sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. There is a scene in the beginning where the boys are served an inedible slop - Thompson orders ham and eggs and stops the bread on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although she is only "Blonde", has one of the most memorable lines when she pits and says "I thought there should be young boys here, where are they? "!!! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
