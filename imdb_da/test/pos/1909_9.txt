The Dolemite is amazing. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to a spoof of a genre without actually being spoofed. Citizen Kane this may not be, nor read Infant Au Revoir, but it is without doubt brilliant in itself. The production values ​​in this movie are so poor that they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot pulls a little in the middle, but the power of such a cheap performance as kung fu hookers is enough to bring everyone along with the snootiest movie lovers through. The infamous, ever-present boom mike evokes nuances of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny. I sometimes wonder that the boomers were abandoned for the purpose of commenting on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I am usually distracted by erotic scenes lacking eroticism to the high artistic point. Everything is this movie is alive and breathing, dripping with desperate longing to be loved and pampered at the same time. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
