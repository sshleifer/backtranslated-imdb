If the film is about vision and reality, the movie is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the US from Italy at the beginning of the '900, but it also speaks for now as emigration / immigration is still a focus. <br /> <br /> It's not a rich visionary movie. <br /> <br /> Works on the extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg a star. A Good Challenge for the Academy Award 2007 After the first Crialese's attempt, "Respiro", an emotional but for intellectual film, this has taught Fellini and Taviani's lesson to name only two Italian gentlemen. <Br /> <br /> Plot claims to control precisely, perhaps just a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If VOLVER (challenging for Oscar next year) by Almodovar is a mature movie of an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves more because of his good efforts to be a European film for the American scene . <br /> <br /> And that's it!
