I had borrowed the three Sarah films from a friend and had seen them while they were ill in bed during a weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. I enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked to perform the "Billy-boy" song, which was first heard under the credits of the first movie, entitled "Sarah, Plain and Tall." But the one thing in the winter's end that I didn't like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she had just too much spirit and resembled a brat in relation to the other children, even in terms of talkative but still good-natured Caleb when he was younger.
