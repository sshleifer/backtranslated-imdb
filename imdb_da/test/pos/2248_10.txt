Before watching this movie - clear your ears, take the makeup off your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This image gives you both heat enough to keep your relationship long enough. If you are a Jew / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, what popular film minority is ever - laughs at your memories. If you are something else or anything, you are still - laughing at the bittersweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. That this movie, nothing will seem strange, how weird it might seem. Still, I'm afraid few will see this movie because it's not the kind of picture people see when they go to movies. But please, do it for humanity, and don't forget to make the soundtrack a joy.
