This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It presented a culture in a real, unholy way. One must see for everyone who likes Indie and for those who do not. I think this movie will draw more into the indie scene. The action was top notch! Alice's character was portreyed as well. With perfect akwardness. This movie should be brought to the mainstream! I think it would do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen since doing ALICE. A look that is untouched by the Hollywood hand. Movies like this show young people that these things are not glamorous, but that they are genuine and compelling. If you liked PIECES OF APRIL you will love this one!
