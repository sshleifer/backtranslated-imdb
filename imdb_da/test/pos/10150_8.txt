Less than a thriller than a colorful adventure with exciting elements, MANEN, who knew for many, should not really be compared to such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, BACKWARD or PSYCHO; Instead, it is more akin to such cozy shovels as catching a thief and north by the northwest. The film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run out of a slaughter - and when their young son is kidnapped to secure their silence. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles from the all-American couple, and the characters get an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of "the ugly American abroad "about his personality; Day, which plays a popular scene and captures star retired on its marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play very well in history. MAN, who knew for many, contains a number of famous scenes; Both the scene where Stewart's fabric day before she told her about the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts is very powerful. Less often noted that although I do not even seem to be more satisfying, the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines a thrill along with perverted humor, as when Stewart tries to discover a taxidermist's shop and daybags, "Que Sera, Sera" in a most appropriate way at an embassy cocktail party. <br /> <br /> Although MANEN, who knew too much, lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greater work, it remains an enjoyable movie and one that compares very well to its work as a whole. It is Hitchcock light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
