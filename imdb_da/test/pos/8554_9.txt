I stumbled upon this movie while flipping channels at tevee late one night. It has continued to hold my interest some twenty years later, because of the important lesson in fact, it teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And even though it tells a true story that takes place in World War II, it is unbelievably the case with the ugly things that are happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you believed "ethnic cleansing" as it is today, has something to do with race or ethnicity, you will think differently after seeing this story. <br /> <br /> I suppose I had been pretty naive in believing that the evil follows any prescribed set of rules. Evil is like evil does. <br /> <br /> This film teaches a valuable lesson, and I especially recommend it for example. church groups or bourgeois organizations. <br /> <br /> I don't expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I really want to see it again because there is a fantastic scene in it that gives a completely unintentional but interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of "race expertise". In this scene, the protagonist captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war is "discovered" by an SS racial authority and ushered into a room. There, the two types play a guessing game where the SS officer is able to determine where our heroes (Anthony Quinn's character) came from - and where his ancestors came from. Well, "came to find out" that Quinn's character is not a member of a "subordinate" race, but on the contrary, he is a perfect archetypal Aryan! Which doesn't mean much to Quinn's character, who is more interested in talking about cities, rivers and mountain ranges that the SS guy had just named ... Nevertheless, it's a perfect Aryan archetype that has its benefits. He has, among other things, left his work in a slave labor factory, where he wears striped clothes and enters a slave modeling job, where he is going to wear customized Nazi uniforms. Yes, it is a better concert for sure for a guy who always appreciates wearing nice clothes ... until the Allied armies arrive and recognize his face from the canister. <br /> <br />
