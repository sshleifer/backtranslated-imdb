Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he cuts loose and puts out his maudlin approach to drama. He manages to experience Barry Levinson's usual detained pacing, and there are moments in this movie when he really shines. As the fun elected American president of the "Man of the Year", the Williams regains the hilarity and monstrosity that used to be associated with him. What makes him so appealing is his humanity and equality. Here is a man who can lean on his audience but really love them too. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. That's what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life. <br /> <br /> Once again, Laura Linney shows an intelligent woman in need. She is a fabulous and very talented performer, but I think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. The walks go pretty much through its roofless role, and the climatic scene in the SNL dirt flows almost over water. <br /> <br /> For a few fun moments, they are invaluable. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie.
