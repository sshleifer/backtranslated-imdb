The first feature length of the Muppet Movie, and except perhaps The Muppet Christmas Carol, is the movie pops world-wide still looking for as a guide. Disney has made Muppets a dis service and this movie proves it again and again. With classic comedians and guest stars comos, you stick to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in songwriting and Electric Mayhem madness and come out with a great movie, especially when you realize that the big casts are popping. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with dolls. Half of the fun today plays is that cameo actor / actress still alive ???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz, and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow save and revive Kermit and Company from the lethal understanding of Disney.
