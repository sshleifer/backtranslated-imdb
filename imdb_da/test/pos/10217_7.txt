Let me say from the beginning that I'm not a particular fan of this kind of movie, but Nightbreed has some fascination for me with a message of perspective. In the old days, the people who inhabit the Midi would have been called zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain human beings, this Craig Sheffer is born with the potential to become part of that world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg first looks like the gentle male professional has taken himself into a fanatic mission to free the Nightbreed world. He tricks the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery named Midian Cemetery, where Nightbreed gathers and lives underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer has also left a girl friend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after being killed and now one of the undead. She tries in her own way to be a bridge to humanity. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker creatures are a rather cruel appearance and are not very fond of humans. But it is clear that if people left them alone, Nightbreed does not break again. <br /> <br /> Your sympathy is definitely with Nightbreed, especially after watching a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid in action. <br /> <br /> For some time now, Clive Barker has been an out gay man and some have suggested to me that Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see where it would come in, especially since there are many people who do not even think of gays as something human because they are taught that way. <br /> <br /> The Proof Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of free violence, but it also makes you think, and I like the way Clive Barker faces traditional theology and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for Nightbreed creatures.
