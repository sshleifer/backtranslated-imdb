When the movie started, I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some of the soap opera antics, I started to like it. The reason was different than anything I had ever seen. Now it was a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classified as a horror, or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was, the creatures were only there for a short time. I can only assume that it was for money reason. <br /> <br /> The good side was that the movie was very entertaining. It was my interest (after the start) and made me wonder about creatures from another dimension. It was obvious that this was a first-time film for the director, but there were a few highlights. At the end I was hooked. Too bad Hollywood didn't make any more money behind this.
