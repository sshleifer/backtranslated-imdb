This is a gem. Indeed, as film Four production, the expected quality was delivered. Shot with great style that reminded me of some Errol Morris movies, well arranged and just gripping. It is still awful for a long time until it is scary. We know that something bad has happened (one can guess at the absence of a person in interviews), but we are forced to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. History spans most conceivable aspects, and unlike some documentaries, one did not try to refrain from showing the ugly sides of history, as well as having to do with people's guilt as he left him and wondered why they did not stop him in time. It took me a couple of hours to get out of the melancholy that grabbed me after seeing this very well-made documentary.
