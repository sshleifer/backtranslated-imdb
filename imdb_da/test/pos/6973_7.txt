** SPOILERS ** A simple movie about simple people who have problems is far too complicated to handle. <br /> <br /> Natalie aka Sara Ravenna, Shirley Knight, has been overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she is now pregnant is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Taking Off Her Home in Long Island New York Natalie has no idea where she goes, but hopes to find peace and quiet somewhere in the heart of America. It's on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that Natalie chooses hitchhiker Jimmie "Killer" Kilgannon, James Cann, who seems so lost and confused as she is. When Natalie calls herself Sara at that time, he soon finds out that Jimmie had suffered severe brain concussion while playing football at his collage team and has been reduced to such a single-minded person who is so passive that he lets everyone, including later in the movie Natalie, step over him. <br /> <br /> Sympathetic first Natalie gets very annoyed at the self-pitying Jimmie for not standing up for herself and being used as a doormat by everyone he comes into contact with in movies. Without knowing what to do with the child-like Jimmie Natalie, he finally gets a job far away from Nebraska as a cleaning man at Reptile Jungle Pet Market, owned and run by, Mr. Alfred, Tom Aldrege. Being the both friendly and simple person that he is Jimmie, lets all the animals get out of their cages and causes chaos in the pet store and fired by his boss Mr. Alfred. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie who thought she was finally doing Jimmie ends up in the Reptile Jungle when she gets a speed ticket from traffic consultant Gordon, Robert Duvall. It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person Natalie has to pay his traffic fine for. While all this happens to Gordon, the police had developed a strong taste for Natalie and want to get her in the bag, on her trailer home, the first chance he can. Gordon a widower with an uncontrollable 12-year-old daughter Rosalie, Marva Zimmet, needs a mature woman - with lots of lovin '- to make him forget about his many social and mental problems, and Natalie is just the medicine that the doctor has ordered! <Br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** Wild and shockingly finally with Gordon completely out of his mind and trying to rape Natalie, who refused his drunk advancement, which has finally come out of his selfish stupidity and came for her rescue. There is no happy ending here with Natalie rescued from being both hand-traded and raped by Gordon, but Jimmie who ran Gordon around as a Ping-Pong ball ending death for all his good and noble efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy was by far the most tragic and sympathetic person in the whole movie. All Jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with everything he ended up getting was the end of the stick. Of all even the one person who initially treated him with kindness and understanding Natalie Ravenna! Eventually, Jimmie even though he was treated as dirt by all despite his willingness not to offend that even those who passed over him came out as the most sympathetic best as at the same time heroic person throughout the film.
