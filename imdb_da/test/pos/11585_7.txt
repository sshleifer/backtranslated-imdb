Factors (I): "Mar Adentro" refers to the well-known (at least in Spain) tale of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegic who killed himself (aided by some friends) after 28 years as a result of his condition. The judges had repeatedly denied their demands for active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> -Facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes this year's film in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the critics' opinions are unanimous. The movie wins many prizes (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and annoys the Catholic community and life women's quadriplegics. A star is born. <br /> <br /> Factors (III): The intensity and quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" is just amazing and it makes me wonder how do we see the same bad young actors in most Spanish latest movie. I do not know whether Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is quite a difference between one or another); Anyway, his job is just impressive, as well as Lola Dueñas, Belén Ruedas, or the job of all guest stars. This is (the actor's choice) the strong point in Amenábar's film. <br /> <br /> Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at Cinema School, there is no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain. He takes good control of each of the technical aspects he knows what the audience wants, he knows how to touch the right chord, even though it becomes him such a demagogue (like Spielberg is - one of Amenabar's idols -). <br /> <br /> Factors (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", it looks like you have some sort of problem with the moral problem the story tells. There is a trap in this kind of images: you have to distinguish between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you don't like "Schindler's List," it doesn't mean you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you?). So for me it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (since it's a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, self-evident and anything but neutral (whatever Amenábar or Bardem has said about it: the signs that are not in favor of euthanasia do not come in handy !!). 50% Hard / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogue: "Mar Adentro" would not be irrelevant in my ranking of the best 50 Spanish films from all the time. No one has any special merits in history, but Ramon Sampedro himself. He's the movie. Now Alejandro Amenábar will be the more international Spanish director ever, perhaps he will go to Hollywood. but some of us would like to see him filming a simple story without getting any final twists without live death or dying alive ... "The Others" is still his best movie. My rating: 7/10
