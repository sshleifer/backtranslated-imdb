Almost no information is available on this movie or its air dates. After an ongoing and exhaustive search I found the DVD available for 3.99! -Release date February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / DVD and video. To get this information informed, I will continue to say that this is a well-made movie with a true and fascinating story of a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. It's a chance to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. made him a star. Also highlighted in the story is the venerable Barbara Hershey - does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to continue writing to get it sent. Thank you to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure TV movie that obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
