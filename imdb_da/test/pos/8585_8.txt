Being Belgian myself, I am interested in Congo's history. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and that is part of our country's history. Today, it seems very popular to say that all the Belgians did to Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying there didn't happen bad things. Of course they did, but it was not abnormal. Do you really think the French or British were so much nicer in their colonies? No, they weren't. It was "normal" at the time of our King Leopold II to use the Congo as a means of achieving personal prosperity. It was his private property (it didn't belong to the state then) and he tried to get the most out of it. Of course, cruel things like hands are cut off, done and yes to today's standards that cannot be considered for treatment, but these days it was commonplace. And it must be said, all this happened no more over the last few decades ... I know more people who have lived one functioning in the Congo for many years before the declaration of Congolese independence. It is true that they had more black servants, but they are very nice people, and I really cannot imagine that they have ever treated them badly. As far as I know, they have always treated them with great respect (though I do not say all the Belgians did). In fact, if they weren't so old now (almost all about 80 years old now), they would love to return to Congo. The good thing about this movie is that it provides a historically accurate vision of what happened in recent years with Belgian governance and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not as black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean) as I feared it would be. It does not say that all the Belgians did it wrong, and all Congolese did well. It perfectly shows how the Congolese in their hustle and bustle of being independent of the Belgians did not mind accepting help from the Russians as well as the Americans, who both watched the raw materials like copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber, ... and get the Congolese their political 'camp' and were not all who were interested in their independence. It not only gives a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became stronger, but also how Mobutu played a dual role. This shows the Belgian reaction that some of our compatriots are being violated, threatened and even murdered. (My father was one of the parachute colors sent to Congo to save the Belgians). It gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba encountered when the province of Katanga did not want to be part of the Congolese republic, what role the Belgians had in the murder of Lumumba ... it all comes to this film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters really look and work the right way. This film has been able to give a very good idea of ​​what life in the Congo at the end of the nineties and the beginning of the sixties was like and should be seen by anyone interested in the country's history. But it must also be seen in history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is part of our history, which should never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
