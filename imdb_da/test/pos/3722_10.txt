I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for as long as I have known his name, I have also searched for this film. I tried to look for this movie anywhere in California for over four years. This past summer I took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and saw it in France! I was blown away, it made my turn completely, and I finally feel satisfied that I have seen Luc Besson's first work. absolutely fantastic character development, very thoughtful, amazing plays and the ultimate concept movie. If you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic. I feel as if it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one, its risky, its unorthodox, and ultimately it is just exactly unique. If you are a luc besson fan, it is actually a must see if your a besson fan or not, it is definitely an important work, generally a great contribution to the cinema's immortal art.
