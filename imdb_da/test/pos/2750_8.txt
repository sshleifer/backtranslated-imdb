Very good "Precoder" starring Dick Barthelmess, who reminded me of Hawks' Only Angels Garden Wings (1939), where Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterly William Wellman, who was responsible for the Military Aviation Silent Picture "Wings". <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays a devil-maybe-caring airplane pilot who is causing an aviation accident. Then he meets and falls for beautiful Sally Eilers, who participates as part of a law in a bypass Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears in the scene, a triangular relationship follows. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some moving and touching scenes also thanks to the great chemistry that evolves between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, looks very much like actress Dorothy Mackaill ). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess's brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown of Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stunts, fast paced movies; in all very entertaining. Don't miss it when TCM floats it again.
