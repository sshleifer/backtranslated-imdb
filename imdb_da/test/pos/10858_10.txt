I think Andrew Davies did an admirable job of taking a grand book that emulated the pace and styling of a Victorian novel and turn it into a moving and entertaining movie. I'm glad I read (twice) the book first, which is usually the case for me. I know you have to see a novel and a movie as different media and judge them accordingly. But it is often difficult to read the original material after a movie gives the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the script. Davies, whom he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, particularly wanted to emphasize the more scatological bits in the book. I certainly enjoyed them, on movies as in the book. But Davies missed half a dozen moments that are so rude, painfully tender that he could have incorporated if his sensation was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also address the problem of his use of the book's primary symbol, the rose. When the manuscript was drawn by Davies, the old age was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that author Waters' final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. And I preferred way, the novel let Nan "age" than the way Davies chose. <br /> <br /> A quick commentary on the four actors preparing the primary roles. They are all wonderfully talented - well, except for song and dance, maybe - and besides, their physical preferences are so much what the mind's eye sees when reading the novel before watching the movie. I thought they were amazing. I recommend that every lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction adds both the book and the DVD of TIPPING THE VELVET to their bookshelves.
