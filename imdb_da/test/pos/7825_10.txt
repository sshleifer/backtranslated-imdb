It is typical of people who complain about something when they have nothing to do with it ... So it is a gay man who falls to equal women. First of all ... This is a true story so you can't say it's not credible. The other is written by a gay man, so the whole thing about being gay is just stupid. Personally, I think this was the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very pro gay. I think it shows that true love is about personality, not just appearance and sex. And it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. Perhaps we in Europe are taking it more because most TVs are a bit deeper and make you think more than American TV ... And we don't fear when it comes to showing particular things. <br /> <br /> If you want something fun with one of England's best (Lesley Sharp) and you will see a decent trustworthy love story without too much juice it is for you. I know I love it
