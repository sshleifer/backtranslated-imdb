Recently, it had the pleasure of watching this emotionally-charged movie by Mani Ratnam Director at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I have given my highest honor to the film festival on this feature. Make sure you don't let an opportunity to experience this biographical gem pass you ... but be impoverished: This movie will make you throw a tear if you belong to the species known as the homo sapien! And 10 !!
