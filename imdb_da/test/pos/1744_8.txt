This is a very modest, very nice movie with a great score of Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We are The Couple In The Castle which is quite evocative for the period and goes back to Penthouse Serenade like the opening premise (Hoppity's coming ) may well have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with the posters who have noticed that if the name Disney was added to this, it would now have achieved "classic" status rather than neglected. It is wonderfully inventive, never more than when objects are hardly noticed in the 'real' world, assuming a much greater importance - both for and against the insect world. In fact, it's a classic, albeit a smaller one.
