The whole series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nightlife we've ever seen. The section on depth is like traveling to outer space! We've seen this with our 10 and 7 year old boys, and all four of us haven't been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and couldn't believe it. There are so many new information that we have never learned in school. It is also the best view we have seen from any television or movie to the delicate balance of our Earth's ecosystem. How much time and effort has been put into capturing these shots is very clear when you sit down and look at this series. <br /> <br /> A must see for everyone.
