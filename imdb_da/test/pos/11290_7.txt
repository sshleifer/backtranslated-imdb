Although it doesn't really matter to the movie, it's a Creation myth. God (a cramped bloody figure in a chair) cuts out his organs with a straight razor and dies in his own rubbish. Mother Earth rises from its body and impregnates itself with its seed and gives birth to man. However, it is very unlikely that you can figure out anything without reading a synopsis first, and it is not very important for the movie you are doing, as it is more of a surreal art house, all in ink, black and white treated. A sick, gloomy atmosphere is created with the strong photograph and minimal sounds (mostly water drops, moans, scrapers, etc.), but each scene goes a little too long and it makes the movie as a whole. This could have been good as a short film, and the God who killed himself was excellent and extremely scary, especially the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you do Don't even know what you are looking for much of the time. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
