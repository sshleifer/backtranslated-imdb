Let's start from this point: This is not a movie intended for the common audience. Completely bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, completely unpredictable, it just keeps you rocky and looking at the screen and trying to figure out what's going to happen next time. If that in itself doesn't agree, it's an excellent movie, so go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It has material to be considered a cult movie, it can be placed in the same category of movies that win honors in Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately, Hollywood has already dropped into oblivion simply because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael cannot be an Oscar material, but he gives the right touch on the story. Even the genre is difficult to describe; It's not a comedy in the right sense, you don't know if you should laugh at the strange situations where Gus gets involved. It's more like an impossible adventure that some kids might want, but don't let them see it either ... it's not a movie for kids. So if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Home Alone" style, this is definitely not for you. But if you enjoy reading Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you would like Motorama. Then jump into your red Mustang, get a tattoo spell "Tora" and cruise Strangeland with Gus. I liked that
