IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked most was Howard's bachelor party. This was because they broke jokes about a lot of things, including the Barbra Streisand movie. I also thought Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very pretty in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is, "Are all homosexuals? Is this 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE'?" It was absolutely fun! The one sign I couldn't stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This was because she was very astonished and snobbish. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all of your Kevin Kline fans who haven't seen it. Be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.
