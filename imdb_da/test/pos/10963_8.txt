In the end, credits of "Shadows" after we read 'directed by John Cassavetes', some white letters on the screen can be seen: "The movie you've just seen is improvised," they say. I always pursue that words are so important in movies, as the filmmakers started using them because basically there are no movies without a script and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of the word; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It is a film without real protagonists without real masterpiece lines; It is mostly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some of the situations are connected, but Cassavetes, who seems to always be rushing to get to the speakers, uses a fast-paced technique when the characters come somewhere or escape from someone and do not speak. <br /> <br /> Appearance is all in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and many amazing solos, and there is a sign that he is a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters' names are the same names the actors). However, we never see him playing trumpet or jam with a band; He doesn't even talk about music and just walks with his friends around town. They speak a lot and about something that is in their minds; "Shadows" is fun in its intellectual references in parts like the above because these friends are not cultivated. However, the only important female character in the film (Lelia) will be an intellectual. But again, she has a very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she is trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At the same party, a woman actually makes an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a guy next to her: "Do you agree?". "Yes," he says, but you can tell he doesn't know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), speaks of his glory days in occasions, and we see him perform only once but no references to the musical industry there. Cassava's focus is the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), who for the most part involves chats about trivial things and not real "musical" conversations. So the trumpet player's important deal in "Shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; the intellectual wannabe girl is her way of dealing with romantic relationships (one of the strong points of the movie), and the singer's bond with his manager ?? Appearances. The reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation without feeding, if they were actually good. I think some of them are not, but they probably know how to improvise in a scene and you can notice how well they do it. "Shadows" are not about artists; It's about a way to make a cinema, based on the magic of conversation. And there you can say that performances matter. Therefore, in any conversation as a stalker, the camera is constantly on all the characters' eyes, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene where the trumpet player and his friends try to gather some girls. They are three, so each one is next to a girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. They all talk at once and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes friends see each other as they say what they say. It is natural.
