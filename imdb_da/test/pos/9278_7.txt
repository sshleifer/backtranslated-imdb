I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary about what I considered some of the most entertaining films ever made. Adults in L.A. During the 60s, many of these old black and white films were shown at local stations. I also remember a Friday night show called "Strange Tales of Science Fiction" that featured another Sci Fi flick every week. However, this documentary has spent too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmmaking. This is not what I was hoping for in this documentary. It could really have been a comprehensive study of the decade rather than a brief highlight of the most famous films in the era. Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films is quite familiar with standouts such as World of War, Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The Day Earth, Something, etc. I would like to have seen some excerpts from lesser-known films and maybe some interviews with people involved in making these films. I would agree that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg's statements and was a kind of commercial for his new release of World of War.
