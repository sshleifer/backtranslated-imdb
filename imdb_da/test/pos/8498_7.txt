If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes in 'Ray' and asked what I was thinking of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time for an empty star. What is this (fictional) person talking about? It wasn't Jamie Foxx on the big screen. It was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances in any of the recent years. As the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is widespread. <br /> <br /> The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step in mixing the gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not good. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-written biopic outline. Super talented youth struggles adversity, achieves greatness at the same time as self-destruction, so he chooses himself out of the race for a good ending. The film shows Charles' mistakes (heroin abuse, chronic women, persistent bastard faring), although it sucks you in with its beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the biggest women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his long-term mistress. Both actresses match the Foxx fight for battle. What, on the other hand, takes him to another level is his deep understanding and scary imitation of the great musical. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his haughty mother and Curtis Armstrong as music executive. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and --- even better --- more important. <br /> <br /> I wasn't Ray Charles aficionado before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film has extinguished a lot (like all biopics), but this image serves as both an old-fashioned crowd pleaser and a dark study of a brilliant / restless man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing (as if somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. Not a single actor can still sing like Mr. Charles. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to "everything" as we will probably see for a while.
