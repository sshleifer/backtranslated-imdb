This is one of Julie's greatest tribute to music, along with her "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl" album. To quote the great Medusa "Dare to go just, just wear your underwear, you get a ride home every time" - Wow !!! Now it's some good advice. "You can dance at my party! Yes, justify your dancing shoes! ..... You're invited to the party in my pants. Yes, come on, let's dance, at the party in my pants" Julie Brown is fun !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is great !!!
