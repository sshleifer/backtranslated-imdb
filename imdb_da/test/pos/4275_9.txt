As a local performer, I thought "Fat" showed what Broadway producers are looking for, and it highlighted a little of the working population. Although my favorites didn't win (but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself with them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer. <br /> <br /> They brought in Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between Broadway production and television audiences. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie ("Hopelessly Devoted," et al.) because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the B'Way cast looks so much older, but you have to remember that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails to be there. If the whole casting was green and fresh, I think it would have compromised the casting process with which manufacturers choose their talent.
