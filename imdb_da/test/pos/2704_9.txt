By watching this movie, I was amazed at how the media's perception can create a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard float the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities today, they were often criticized for their music as well as their appearance, styles, etc. It had a great effect on Karen who hit a fight against her and lost drastic weight, eventually giving her death. This heart film was not originally something I would have thought of seeing. But when I started to see it, I was hooked. Like the Tina Turner story, this film enlightens you and allows you to look into the life of the young artist. The action was fantastic, and even after almost 20 years after it was made, the direction and dialogue are still entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it. It is incredibly accurate and emotionally charged.
