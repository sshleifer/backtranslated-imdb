After sleeping out of sheer solitude, Lestat wakes from a 100-year sleep to the sound of a new music he wants to be a part of, and the band "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His longing to end his loneliness and his "living in the light" attitude along with his music, angered his fellow men and awaken an evil that has been slumbering for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those seeking a true book-to-movie adaptation. Those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in a huge disappointment. This movie will appeal to those who really enjoyed the "Interview With the Vampire" movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few plot holes and inconsistencies, but overall, this movie was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a sensuality and sexiness missing from the previous movie. The conditions depicted in the film were very sexy and sizzling. <br /> <br /> As a movie, history forces you and pulls you in. Casting is wonderful. Loved this story and movie. If you like smearing sensuality and sexual excitement, you'll love this movie!
