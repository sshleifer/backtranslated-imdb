This movie would be considered controversial today, but is still a lot of fun. Races stereotypes are made from humor and not hate. This film strips and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the early 1930s. This film shows that it started before the 1970s and beyond when it has accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in her typical genre here, even though his character was raised in China. <br /> <br /> The importance of a cat paw in this case is a person running to a political office but being used by the incumbent political machine to promote their agenda. In other words, they think this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he runs to the office. So when he is elected, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> The same theme is later used in James Stewart's film. Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This movie is smarter and subtle, as is Harold Lloyd's trademarks. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of romantic comedy tucked away with the filad's façade, but today's traditional audience will still appreciate political humor and the end is absolutely priceless. I want someone to beat today's political system in this way. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie and find myself Harold had done more like that in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this one. I think the person quoted most in the movie is fictional Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was the wise one, but this makes me believe that wisdom in China was not limited to him and is a vast area of ​​comedy Lloyd mined in this movie.
