This film is based on the book "A Many Splendored Thing" by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and whites, a subject that comes from His personal experiences as a European grows in China. The background and the beautiful Hong Kong settings give this love story a unique and rather bold atmosphere for the time being. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, history is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that may be more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks at that part and gives a wonderful, Oscar-nominated performance as a mixed race doctor during communism in the mainland. William Holden never looked better at playing a romantic leadership as a journalist covering war-torn regions in the world. The play is top notch, and the chain between the two lovers gives some real moments of the silver screen's love, which is sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined. The cinematography really brings out fifty Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor, where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The end is a real tear. Some may consider sentimental romance pass√©, but for those who enjoy classic Hollywood Love stories, this is a shining example.
