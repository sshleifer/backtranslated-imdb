I'm sorry to say because if you watch this movie now, you realize how low our media has dropped - all warning signs are in this movie. It's a great movie, I think the last big James Brooks movie, but others may disagree. It has rich characters (which are also trustworthy), great plays, good writing, and even though the music was a bit cheesy, I even liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is amazing. And Albert Brooks goes away with every scene he's in this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and convincing and has the whole movie weakened by the important and important topic of the news and how it slowly gets compromised in our nation. <br /> <br /> Watch this with NETWORK for a really fun and frightening evening.
