Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and doctors over the years than I usually think about. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pump and pretension in every aspect of our society, through the setting of one of its most frightening institutions ... the medical profession. <br /> <br /> The idea that such outcomes might be possible may be a shock to some, but is a joy to everyone with the perspective of experience. Dr Brock (Scott) undergoes a life-long crisis with monumental proportions before our eyes as we and he becomes enchanted with the prospect of his engagement with Miss Drummond (Rigg). The absurd thread is woven into this wonderful blend in the form of the irony that the hospital seems to kill its own workers as they mismanage their affairs in it. The Climax is unpredictable (unless you see it make it even more fun if you happen to guess. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's humorous brand, surely, and has incredibly fun "Dark moments" if you're open to them. </ br /> <br /> I loved every minute and was happy to watch it on DVD.
