I watched this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. The photograph is just so stylish and beautiful, and the story just isn't your average mafia movie, in fact the story is pretty much in the background. It is more the personal journey of a medieval man who is trapped in an existence he was forced to live. The actor Toni Servillo is great, he distinguishes this "quiet man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the daughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family's surname. <br /> <br /> If you expect your typical Italian movie, where everyone screams to each other in big families, this is NOT your movie. There are not your average clich√©s and it is definitely worth seeing.
