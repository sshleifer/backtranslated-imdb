Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through soap opera "A reason for love" as a way to escape her hit man and boring life. After a shocking incident involving two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, believing she's destined to marry the show's protagonist (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is the rare thing, a lesser-known movie with an all-star cast and a fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprises with the amazing script and spot on acting. In fact, such a plot makes a question for the R classification, but it is really good. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is a bit too graphic compared to the bright, funny comedy that comes and feels like something out of another movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believe in Betty's transformation Doe eyed, lovable nut job does she. <br /> <br /> As we join Betty on her journey, instructor Neil LaBute does some extraordinary magic that makes the movie unique and high over your bog standard comedy. An example of this would be Betty's first encounter with her crush. She pours her heart out to him, and he plays together and thinks she auditions for a part on the show. Even as we are aware of Betty's fate's contaminated nature, the music swells as she speaks and gives us, the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe in what she says, but we understand that her mind is broken. While other filmmakers will try to accentuate the ridiculous situation of twisting every ounce of eventual comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his protagonist and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> banter between the hit men played by Freeman and Rock is invaluable, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. Freeman in particular is excellent as always and pacing herself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of Betty, not even really knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart shows once again the versatility of the ungrateful role Betty's not good man is, and he is almost irreversible. The second revelation here is Kinnear, whose depiction of the soap's star is not too overcooked. There is a tendency to put on the celebrity bastard clich√© as thick as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead imbibing him with a pompous but self-conscious self-esteem, despite just being a soap star. <br /> <br /> The soap opera is realized so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical, much of the film would not have worked. To make a "Days of our life", spoof as seen in friends will have been the wrong step for this movie. The dedication to detail is settled, as the style and feeling of the soap opera begin to bleed into Betty's reality more and more while adhering to the overall unintentional comic aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real, unlike some movies where the atmosphere feels so crafted, you wondered why people who make it alive can't get it right. <br /> <br /> The nice resolution of the final action, although predictable, is quite satisfactory. It is a pity that after LaBute had directed this wonderful movie, mainstream came to call him to lead The Wicker Man's strange remake, a good example of a man so completely over the material given to him. Unfortunately, one cannot free him from all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Nurse Betty, it's something to discover. If you have, it's worth visiting again. There is a charm for Nurse Betty who is contagious, though it may not leave you thinking so much afterwards. A hidden gem anyway.
