I watched this movie on ITV and I enjoyed it very much. It was very visible and very fun. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention as she creates a wonderfully varied interesting sign to see. Ben's character is a little shy and Stoic, but the changes he goes through are wonderfully done by Rupert Grint, I will surely say he has a future in acting for Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is pretty good at her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is making her too .... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and finally he is also honest. The only sign I wasn't interested in was Bryony, she was a bit ordinary and unnecessary I thought. All in all, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to see. one of my favorite movies of the year easy.
