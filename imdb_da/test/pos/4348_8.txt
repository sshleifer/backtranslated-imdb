<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I have never seen a movie lacking in any moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the foam of death! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in showing a difficult world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he give us the spoon with a complete hell on earth seen through the moustached Bronson's face, but he also shows us the spoon he feeds us and says "look at what you see now looking at yourself and ask the question: Do you enjoy And even if you want to tell yourself, it can't be !!!! You know it deep inside, you want to know ... it's a masterpiece
