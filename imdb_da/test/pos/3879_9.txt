He made one for Christmas to try to bring back a number one song, and now the amazing Justin Lee Collins would reunite the cast members and perhaps some crews of one of his favorite TV shows as a child, The A-Team . The only member he could not get was the late great George Peppard who played the protagonist Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, but he got some kind of psychic trying to help. He managed to reunite all members, including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz, Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen), William Lucking (Col. Lynch) and Lance LeGault (colleague Roderick Decker, the only member of the team to die). He spoke to Mr T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in an expected interview, but he was not available to turn up at the reunion. It was really fun to look at him who tried to find them and talk to them, although they probably wouldn't, and the reunification is of course the great climax. Very good!
