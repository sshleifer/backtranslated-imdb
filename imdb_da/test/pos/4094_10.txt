1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful girlfriend and campy musical film of ALWAYS. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton short story about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a really special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange blend of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction between being the only anti-war musical imagination ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie was a critical and financial disappointment in the US, but earned a lot of money abroad. Only in America did it fail. Very different and unique in its approach as a film music, it deserves far better credit than it is given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both 1937 Frank Capra movies and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton short story. What I think about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the songs are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a gifted instructor and film photographer. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD ARE A CIRCLE, SHARE JOY AND LIVING TOGETHER, AWARE TAKING CHOOSE A GLY that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why should Shangri-La not be a little stupid place? The two love songs I can fear her and the plain I come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture. There is a peace and soft spoken quality in both of these songs, which holds much of history's philosophy. Moreover, the things I will not forget are a good duet with a strong melody. It is a good exchange of different types of perspectives, and who can fault Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on board? They are a wonderful team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I have always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnap a person from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the tall lama is a gentle soul but a little radical in his view of humanity as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be restored today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the leading character, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left in the outside world, as opposed to what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, in order for the movie to be credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as a suffering amnesia at the end as if he were in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were true to the novel in that respect. Find Conway Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway, who wants to believe in Shangri-La and returns to his old life in the world, is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van, as they see their friends leaving the mysterious valley. Interesting how Conway won't leave paradise, but gets pushed out of his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in exploring James Hilton's ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So, in a way, it is anti-capitalism in the theme where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human friendliness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other are the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It tries to answer the basic fundamental questions of life, and one can hardly fail to fail. One must remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was the post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable that characters broke out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for criticized critics. Expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two goals to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had had decades of economic success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow-up movie to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT. This film was Universal's greatest moneymaker until then, and the success of this image triggered a decade of disaster film. For years, AIRPORT was the most watched movie ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for the 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At that time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unimaginable sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the censorship of films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Gender and violence were a new frontier in the late 60s and early 70s, the audience was flocked to movies with content that they were not used to watching on the screen. Sumptuous musicals were no longer well received, no matter how good they were. Today, LAST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated at several levels. It is the ultimate escapist movie with a strong history, wonderful music, an expensive budget and a bit of flashy humor. It is unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced to 45 minutes in the movie. It changes the course midway through the introduction of the mysterious valley and why not? LAST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves to rediscover. A lost and legendary treasure that deserves far better than its reputation.
