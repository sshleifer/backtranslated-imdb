This was such a great series for black people at that time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many ... many people still talking about the show. If it's released, I'm sure many black youths will find this enlightening and interesting. The show dealt with many topics from racism, intra-racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer pressure and much more. The view ended so abruptly and left it fans' speechless and wondering why it was taken out of the air. Since then, we've only seen a couple of actors and actors. Please drop it on DVD ASAP.
