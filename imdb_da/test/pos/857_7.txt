I caught this movie in the local t.v. At 4:30 am I didn't have expectations for it, but after the opening point I knew I was in something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations left for your interpretation to "figure out" what really happened so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological thriller situation is very much about character development and the way things are done by the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Your part-sciences also play an important role, because through a series of events and dialogues you will be able to correctly interpret and generate meaning. The technical aspects are very good. Really good indeed. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is good at the eye, although she is most of the time in her white clothes. The fear factor is almost incomplete, but there are lots of mystery and excitement to dig out. <Br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.
