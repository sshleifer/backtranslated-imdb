This is Burt Reynold's "Citizen Kane". Tragically, nothing else he was ever involved in was approaching "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he put everything he had in it. It's a movie in love with movies. The open order, where Detective Sharkey simply saves a bus load of hostages, is a tremendously exciting piece of cinema. Everything goes so fast when it is starting to go wrong that it seems to take a life of its own, an excellent effect. It looks cold, tense and dangerous on Mr Reynolds streets. The supply house looks dirty and tired of desperate people on both sides of the law, shouting, cursing, trying to make offers or just staying alive. Until this underworld descends the newly demoted Sharkey - a reward for a bungled drug bust (caused by a corrupt policeman) - he and his team are part of the vice squad. Information they obtain about a curly politician leads them into the world of first-class call girls and ruthless barons drug. Look at the occasion of such a call-girl (Rachel Ward) Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know it), and when a woman's body is found with her face shot in one of the rooms, he thinks it's her . (Well I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene where she enters him seems beautiful, even if you have seen the original. The film is full of great details, I especially like Charles Durning's war history, subtly acting and sharply contrasting with Sharkey's abduction and torture, which is appropriately hard and brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two heterogeneous but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming qualities at all. They are "full of" every time they are on the screen and are no loss to society when their time comes, Mr Silva's end is extra special. As mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood movie that Clint never made. The biggest compliment I can pay "Sharkey's Machine" is to point out that Clint Eastwood, in my opinion, could not have done a better job with it. The soundtrack is of the same high standard with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title sequence and I can never hear it without seeing Sharkey jumping along the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I have never understood why this movie was a bit of a flop. I hope this is due to a critical review, especially at a time when so many cop films and shows without a quarter of their energy, freshness and pure joie de Vivre shelves from the rooftops. If you're ever tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a widespread one-trick pony, put "Sharkey's Machine" in your video machine. I promise you will not be disappointed.
