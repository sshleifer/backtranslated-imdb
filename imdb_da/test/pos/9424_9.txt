Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this superior story of Holmes, who fights the Third Reich and Professor Moriarty's mastermind genius. The film opens up in Switzerland when Holmes is in disguise as an "old bookshop." He should bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans regain the evil professor. Moriarty manages to overcome Scotland farm and LeStrad "Dennis Hoey" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue that Tobel left is a list of "dancing men". Who will break the hidden code for dancers, Holmes or Moriarty first? Can Holmes prevent the bomb area from falling into the German hands and thereby save England from precision bombing techniques developed by Tobel's bombing? See and enjoy.
