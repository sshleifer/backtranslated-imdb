This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Apart from that, I loved the main music this movie turned around. Chris / Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They totally support their son's interests and believe in him enough to support him - now it's AWESOME !! What really surprised me was Chris's recognition at the end. It was not entirely "hollywood" that made its way to self-discovery. The overall rise to stardom and fall was some rollercoaster ride.
