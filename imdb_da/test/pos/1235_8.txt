While caricatures and / or referrals to the entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products are usually a staple in shorts like this, they are not used in quantity here. Most of the individual gags are quite generic. As I will give examples, there will be spoilers below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (good, technical four-there is a quick one at the end of the comic) caricatures that I looked for which is a little low for this type of card, although one is a character with a reasonable activity. They are Jack Benny (like Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the infinite Ned Sparks (as a crab on the chances are very good that if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers card in the 1930s and 1940s, the caricature used be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio program called "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, mother!), A game on Superman (Superguy here) and the villain is a start on "King Kong". It's that kind of gag. The products themselves are mostly generic, and the gags are more playing on basic things in unusual situations, such as. Turtles coming out of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks, tomato soup cans make "The can-can", pepper cakes men who become parachutists, using parachute tissues, etc. Gags are very good and so is an excellent example of a Bob Clampett cartoon. Clampett had hit his steps as a director at this point, and while it's not anywhere near his best work, it's nothing to savor. The brief is available at Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Vol. 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. itself is also recommended.
