I was lucky enough to see a test screening of 'El Padrino' a few months ago in Santa Monica. I was blown away. You can't watch movies like this anymore. In the spirit of Scosese, Chapa tells the tragic stories of Kilo as he maneuvers the difficult streets of LA to rise above the line to become a doctrine of Escobarian proportions. The characters are complex and contradictory. The feelings are genuine. The action is fast and furious. The stunter is expansive. And Tilly is HOT. She hasn't seen this well since her "bound" days. I would recommend this to anyone. It is a wonderful tribute to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. And to all naysayers out there ?? see it again; of course you had your eyes closed the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the movie. I count the days until the successor is released. Someone has a date on it?
