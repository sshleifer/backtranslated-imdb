When I first saw the trailer, I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after hearing about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the whole collection in a box set, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very fun, and the characters were pretty cool. Favorite people in the show are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the opening and closing of the theme songs. The view also has some great talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. However, this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something cool. Then this show is one.
