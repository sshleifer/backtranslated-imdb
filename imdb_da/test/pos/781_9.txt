I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films has downloaded something and releases it, it's generally a good sign, but I'm usually not a fan of Julie Walters, who generally ignores his comedy roles (excuse some fans, but is a personal thing - I just find her fun in comedy). <br /> <br /> However, it was magnificent - a great show of everyone, but Grint and Walters are extraordinary! Lots of laughs, lots of pathos, great timing and a wonderful movie - such a movie that comes in age would not normally be something I could expect to suffer so much, but I cannot recommend it highly enough - and see Rupert Grint as he matures into a nice fine actor.
