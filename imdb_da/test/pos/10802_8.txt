Many American peas that worship and support the political half-truths of hucksters like Michael Moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, scare and lie to an under-informed public and get the people they fear or enemy killed, spidered and mutilated. Robespierre in this fine epic kills the resistance of remote control, all in an appropriate fair devotion to his principles. We get the impression that Robes felt quite justified in cutting off his opponent's heads, even when he sent his minions out to drum up false and misleading charges against the state. Today, the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive to Robes. They just murder your character with insinuation and false accusations that are laid without reason or source. Witness Dan Rather attempted to murder W's character on the eve of the 2004 election or the constant drumming that the 2000 election was stolen, although constitutional scientists continue to scoff at such irresponsible drive.
