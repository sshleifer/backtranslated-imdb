When we are young, we all choose an ideal task for ourselves: artist, actor, author, rocket researcher, etc. While most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character American Movie, Mark, has yet to relax his (and thirty-year-olds) to become a reputable recognized director. Despite the fact that Murphy's law will not leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, Mark is able to endure under every deterrent event with even greater driving to reach his goals. His desire to be an instructor then directs his character to see any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to achieve the goal. While I noticed other IMDB commentators, lambasting Mark's selfishness, I think it is an almost justified kind of selfishness, because Mark does not become a famous director similar to death. He speaks incessantly about leaving some sort of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way of doing this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the viewer of this movie sees early on Mark having a near chance to ever reach his dream. Is he aware of this? No, not at least, and none of his family or friends will let him into the secret (in fact some of them believe in him). Still, the disappointing future that the viewer feels is sure to occur, for Mark does not hinder the ability to find humor in the movie. This is a very much fun documentary. Most of the grin comes from when Mark is busy with scenes for the "Coven". There is a scene where an actor must have a head break a closet, and it just doesn't work. Another scene has Mark's very old uncle Bill saying a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after 20 takes a lot of headscratching and line-stumbling Bill finally decides he's got enough. A lot of humor unfortunately comes from Mark himself. His screenwriting, which he seems to be worthy of a Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "It's okay, it's okay, there's something to live for, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> Unlike what people might think, American Movie is a documentary that everyone can enjoy (although my sister, who saw some scenes, seemed to be pretty bizarre) . The fact that Chris Smith can successfully put on the screen a film that inspires both sadness from Mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with Bill (unfortunately passed before the movie was released) says a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark looks at this documentary. Is he aware that it throws him in a bad light? Or that it turns out to be a fool in many scenes of the movie? Or does he see it as something that will appear before his own A&E Biography segment? It's an exciting topic that amazes me, and I hope the latter will be right for him someday. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
