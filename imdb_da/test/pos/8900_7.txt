I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and looked at every one. I never heard of this movie when it was released, but I saw it with my children last night. I remembered the cartoon well enough to know that much was added to the story of the movie. Some of the changes I thought were a little corny (like the nephew's 'modern' dance and the Viking manager's daughter - almost everything about her), but I found it most enjoyable. Most importantly, seeing the reactions that my children saw on it confirmed that the film was happy with the audience. As a family movie, it seems better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that were not in the book I found had the same appeal as those were. All in all, a fun family movie, whether you are an asterix fan or not.
