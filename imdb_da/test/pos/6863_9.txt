I was shocked at how good this German version of movies like Scream was. Exceed all the modern American bets on slasherfilm. <br /> <br /> What all these movies don't do. Similar characters, true mystery, excitement, graphic murder and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best in its kind to come out for years. The German cinema goes from strength to strength just the last. It's a shame, more people won't go to see such movies because they miss out. It is easily accessible on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, I think you should watch it. It will be one of the best horror movies you will see all year round.
