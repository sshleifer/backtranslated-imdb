Sir. Bean was fun, I loved it, every episode was really fun, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a fun look, and his facial expression was fun !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also fun! <br /> <br /> Seeing all the adventures and situations he gets into is fun, this series was definitely a classic and I still see an episode from time to time. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy should check this out.
