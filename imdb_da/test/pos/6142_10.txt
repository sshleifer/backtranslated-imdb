I like the previous description of this movie as a poem. I caught this randomly on the Movie Channel last night, and was imprisoned enough to hold onto it all the way. There is really just one toally unique voice to the movie, a narrative poem that is meaningful without being decayed in pretension. There are also many hilarious moments from Wirey's middle school days that are raw without being potty humor. It is sad that this film is so low rated. That there are so many 1's makes me believe that the numbers are cooked - I can't see how anyone could see the movie as the unpleasant. It is certainly not a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique point of view on a very unique life, of a man whose much appeal comes from his secession, a solution he must overcome before destroying him. Give this flick a chance. It came out of nowhere for me and I feel richer for it.
