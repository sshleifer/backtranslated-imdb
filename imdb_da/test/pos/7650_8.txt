This would certainly not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So on his recommendation, I bought a copy because I didn't know if it would ever be on TV again. I had never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. First, I had trouble getting into the story because the first part of the movie is a picture of pictures - and that makes no sense. It is only later in the film that it all comes together. The stage cut - if that's what it's called, is a bit striking - it sometimes looks like a couple of frames have been cut out of each scene and the scenes are jerked - but I think it was made to add to unusual (if that is a word). The story runs here and there, and just about the time you have it all out, everything gets upside down and you have to adjust your thinking about who is the bad guy and who is not. Or bad woman. The action is very good - I thought about how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The ending was a real twist, quite unexpected, which I liked. A good show.
