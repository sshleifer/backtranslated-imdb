I haven't seen this fun of a fox show for a long time, and the wait was worth it. The kids in the show have something I can relate to on each episode, and even my dad will sit down and watch it. It is a show not for all ages that are not stupid for children. It is still standing but to the next level. The things that everyone says are things that everyone says and actions that everyone does. It says things that we all think, but in a well-rounded way to present. The first time I saw the show, I couldn't believe it was on the fox and that it was allowed to stay in the air after a few episodes, from Hilary's sweetheart choice to Kenny's sweetheart choice, it's worth seeing.
