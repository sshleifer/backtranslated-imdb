Again, I have read all the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent but totally disagreeable with those who believe it was / are lofty. Personally, I believe that nuclear weapons are the only energy left for us unless our governments (Fed and States) increase funding, thinking homeowners will use photocells on their roof. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern California are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun. I live in a loft that is exposed to total sunlight on its roof all day. I hardly use AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat into the ceiling to about five degrees of cooler. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf Coast in the United States, so I know about humidity ....... <br /> <br /> That said, I found "China Syndrome" to be a compelling movie about what could go wrong if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to inform those who still fear it like the plague: they are safe. TMI is still online ... Director James Bridges carefully watches this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to build excitement and a thought-provoking interesting movie. All roles were successful: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell) and producer Michael Douglas ("Richard Adams") are all good at their roles plus all the other casts. I was also glad there was no score. It was so interesting to get a really lively glimpse of the TV industry's back scenes - it shouldn't be surprising. Currently, Dan Rather is betting CBS and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump says "he is a loser"? Trump - who cares? "Tiberius1234" wrote a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that "being vaporized" by a nuclear waste is much better than living in a wasted world and becoming "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green". Get away from your video games for a few hours and watch this "dated" movie (really it isn't) and get some nuclear energy training. I recommend it to the whole family ....
