It looks b and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this movie! But do it! I didn't expect anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robber has gone wrong, missing a million dollars and two girls on their way to starting a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know which direction the movie is heading, make it a 180 and you'll be blown away by the big twists in the plot! It has a fantastic but unexpected end and you are back, want more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you won't be disappointed!
