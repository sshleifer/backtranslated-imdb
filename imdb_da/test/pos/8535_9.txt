I honestly didn't think first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects, boy was I wrong! From the beginning to the end, the film showed some amazingly good effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie is comparable to Peter Jackson's artworks, although this movie is not as nasty as "Braindead", but I'm sure these guys will make another splatter movie.
