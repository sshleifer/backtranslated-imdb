One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is amazing. He really fills his part and it is wonderful. He is such a good actor that you cannot think of anyone else to share. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard French people, trying to defend themselves in the battle born with a murder ... The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the mood of Paris during the period (which is around 1930-40), between two wars ... The clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. All these things help to make a good movie.
