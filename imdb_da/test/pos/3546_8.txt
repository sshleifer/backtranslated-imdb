Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You don't have to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Although you obviously hate opera, you really will have a bad time with this!) Not surprisingly, the segments vary from brilliant to just fair. Most of the stress seems to be over Godard's contribution - whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change you. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear story; others are more of a mounting of connected pictures. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces are more than 10 minutes or so; If you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you enjoy. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes open for performances by Buck Henry, Beverly D Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price of admission). <br /> <br />
