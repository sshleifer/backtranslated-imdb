Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to fulfill the role of Cato's Philadelphia Gordon, in this story, often compared to Margaret Mitchell's American civil war class Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is undoubtedly his best role as well as her larrakin love interest, and the two leads a wonderful Australian cast in this, no doubt the best known and best loved Australian miniseries. It's an excellent production all around, but don't try to see it all in one place and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrayal of life in the united Australia. Rating: 8/10
