American Movie is a wonderful documentary. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very particular independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first movie. <br /> <br /> The raw film and insightful content of this movie is an excellent example of how to produce documentaries. I also feel that the film can be very inspiring to those of us who would like to be filmmakers themselves.
