A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on Broadway, which means she'll have to leave the little dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a gem (they never eat them). The story contains many opportunities for songs and dance. The movie has two questions that Rusty has to answer: Is fame all that it is blown to be? and is less really more if you are happy? The answer to these questions is the film. The film also does a good job of presenting the talents that all three main characters had. Never a dull moment!
