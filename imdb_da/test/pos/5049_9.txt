To qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old people I know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. - nor have I ever been older. These minor problems out of the way were the relationship between the characters of this film and the feelings expressed therein, completely realistic and genuine. In fact, even though we are not yet 30, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interaction between the protagonist and his wife. For those who do not die young (there is a fantastic line in the movie about this when the two best friends talk about dying younger and one of them says - and I switch, we missed our chance - we just gotta keep it out), we will all be where these signs are one day. I know that many movie guests prefer to be swept away * from reality as opposed to being * confronted * with it, but even they could enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality - and the importance of living life to the full - this movie is.
