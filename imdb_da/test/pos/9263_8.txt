In truth, this really is not a "movie" as much as an extended final episode; By this I mean that if you hadn't followed the TV series (murder: street life), I suppose you would have difficulty following this TV movie. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a good watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that every cast member would return, many after many years of absence, to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. The film brings out the "family" feeling, not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It is all very bitterly sweet to know that this will be the last time we will see them all again under the title HOMICIDE. Historically, I found this movie somewhat lacking. Giardello's Mayor Candidate Committee seems specially designed, and I felt that his shooting could have been dealt with in the context of his permanent position as a lieutenant. Also that. Bayliss's extreme plot twist, which was left hanging at the end of the series, has finally been resolved, but I for one never felt it was necessary; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let's remember that the very first episode first went unresolved for the whole series!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I love this movie and the fact that it was made after H: LOTS had been canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has not had the least exposure to the series. Now if they just wanted to release it on DVD ...
