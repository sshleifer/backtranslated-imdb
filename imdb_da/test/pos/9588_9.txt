Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old lady owner. In the same luggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. <br /> <br /> In no time has Sylvester grabbed Tweety, but a coach comes back and beats the "sneakin" cat, "as he calls him back in his cage. He puts Tweety up "in a safer place" and tells the cat: "Remember now: no tricks!" Sylvester puts her halo on and looks innocent. Yes right. <br /> <br /> I found the funniest things, but did not involve Sylvester versus Tweety, but the "viscious dog" that is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat is mouthing him and paying a great price in a very fun way. Sylvester just doesn't teach, but that's why we love him! (I know a number of IMDb reviewers don't like Tweety, but I like both main characters - they both break me!) <br /> <br /> The train and the surrounding landscape are also beautifully illustrated here - really nice image.
