I've seen a few movies in my time, but this one is unique. You have to see it more than once to really appreciate it, it is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion at the most extreme, and that's filmography is just breathtaking. The Count's character is intensely passionate and tragic without having to raise his voice or actually leave his bed, the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted. The film has some sort of mathematical precision and perfection for what is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all together. This movie is unmissable, all the hype around it and all prices can't begin to do it any justice. Hats off to Michael Ondaatje to write the incredible book on which it is based.
