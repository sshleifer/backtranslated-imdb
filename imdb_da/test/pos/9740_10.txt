In the 60's, the Cleveland television audience could see an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi Show (11:30 am Friday). This was the best mockfest material any of us in junior highs ever saw. We wanted regular "sleepovers" (though we didn't call them) just to get into the fun of seeing these things with a group of friends. So next week we will quote our favorite balls from the latest episode. <br /> <br /> Seeing today is very much the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at the dialogue, the lame creatures, the stupid costumes and the awful spaceships long enough, there are some good things I do not appreciate the first time. Production designers built some good sets, both rooms and laboratory equipment. Charles Middleton's "Ming the Merciless" character was the very best screen villain, certainly up to that time and arguing better than anyone since. Jean Rogers is staggeringly beautiful. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
