I am a physics student myself and I have to say that this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory out there. The Elegant Universe manages to make the whole subject of string (although in fact M) theory accessible to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some popular science programs feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in the deep end throwing technical jargon on them without as much as an explanation and presenting the theory in a dull, outdated style. This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the problems that need to be resolved between the two so that we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe in both large and small scale. <br /> <br /> I suppose some might say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but that's: it's against the point. Explanatory string theory from the beginning is almost impossible without mentioning the physics at the bottom, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you like this program really depends on whether you are willing to be confused first with some of the ideas presented by Greene: Extra dimensions and excitement of spacetime are not widespread in everyday life, are they? But if you continue with some of the more exotic concepts in this program, you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you study physics, yes, it's great entertainment as well as you'll be able to follow and appreciate it even more!
