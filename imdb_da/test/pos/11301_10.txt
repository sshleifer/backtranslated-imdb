I just want to comment on the woman above that the movie makes Beethoven's credit in the beggar. In the beginning, they credit it. Thank you. I think it's a great movie. They just chose the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful, and they picked the voices for the characters very well. It never teaches children to give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up, and it shows children that they can do the same. The film also has humor in for all ages, parents and children to laugh at. The colors of this movie are amazing and the kids can really feel good while they see it. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan, and I'm sure your kid will be too. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and Magic of Pegasus stuff so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they don't see it. Thank you!
