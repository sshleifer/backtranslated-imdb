Another great musical from Hollywood's Golden Age! I liked this movie story of a trio of friends who are artists at a small nightclub far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time, they are very happy with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the small club owner and is also the boyfriend of one of her dancers, Rita Hayworth, who happens to get some attention when she gets the chance to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now talking about the city. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. A dance business by Gene Kelly stands out. He walks alone on the street at night and sees his reflection in a window. His reflection soon begins to dance with him in the streets, great filmography. Don't miss this one, great entertainment.
