This is a nice, de-not-make-em-like-this-kind movie. Well done by all and together with interesting character actors. An intelligent, witty script dealt with the right mix of broad comedy and discreet humor. Hold up to repeated (annual?) Views. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** Re-make this movie of the same name directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of charm and whiteness of the original.
