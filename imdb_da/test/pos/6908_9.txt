I went to see Glenn McQuaid's "I Sell The Dead" in the North American premiere of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. When I saw the other show worldwide, I didn't quite know what to expect from this movie, especially because I hadn't seen the short movie that inspired this great screen adaptation. <br /> <br /> I start with a slightly more detailed plot synopsis without giving away any spoilers. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Arthur Blake, how he became a rough robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his mentor discovered. <br /> <br /> The costume and set design in this movie was excellent. I was amazed to hear that the whole movie was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate on time, which really brings you as a viewer of the day's thinking. This movie works just as well as a period as it makes a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two leaders was very fluid. They played each other with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, and Glenn added his comic touch even in tense situations. The story is very encircling, and the ball rolls right from the start. I would compare it to a visual side turner, always wondering what will happen next time. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique by adding different emotional layers to the film itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie to everyone in the mood for some dark humor, with a bit of horror mixed in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
