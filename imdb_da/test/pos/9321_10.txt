I enjoyed this movie a lot. I found it very entertaining for me because I feel that it captured the romance of the turn of the century Irish-American culture. There are no messages. There is no violence and there is no open sex, just healthy 1947 style entertainment, and Dennis Morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs. A really good movie.
