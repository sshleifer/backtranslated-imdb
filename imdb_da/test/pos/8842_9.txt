"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging his talents into excitement and shock with decent production values, he showed himself a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie. <br /> <br /> Filming in really difficult conditions creates a very credible isolated research base that puts the excitement before even something has happened. The ensemble cast works well with Kurt Russell, who proves a charismatic leading man, even under all that beard. <br /> <br /> Building excitement slowly with instant horror thrills (compassionate effects, master Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy vs. Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that is rarely matched. Given this came out the same year as ET it couldn't be any different! <br /> <br /> Worth seeing / rewatch. 9 out of 10 p. The DVD is excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD comment goes (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus the Dolby Digital remix for even frightening sound effects.
