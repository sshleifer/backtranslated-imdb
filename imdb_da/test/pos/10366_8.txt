Count me as one happy to see no Hastings in this episode. The poor man's Dr. Watson does nothing for me as he just pulls down every scene he is in. Yep is often needed for the story of representative of officials, and a little Miss Lemon is fine for spices, but Hastings turns from painfully dim to over-mannered in various episodes. If I have to sit through a more vacuum "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a rule, the more Poirot you get in a Poirot story, the better. Each line for Hastings is one taken away from Poirot. And I have never read the books, so I really don't care about allegiance to Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem separating the movies from the books. If you want the book as written, read it. I don't see the point of watching the TV version if you know what's coming next in each step. Theater is not prose - don't expect a transcription.
