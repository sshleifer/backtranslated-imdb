Went to the premiere of the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely loved the movie !!! I am Diane's # 1 biggest fan and of course, as always, she gave a great performance !! I've seen every one of her movies and I have to say this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moved and took the weather. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous, but also a great deal serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave a great performance. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate an excellent movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I would definitely go and see it again and again and again. This is the best movie this year so far !!!
