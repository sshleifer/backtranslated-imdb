If you want to forge James Bond, it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who looks like both Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so forward-looking Jean Dujardin, who captures the perfect Connery snow that masks like a smile plus the Rossiter's self-sufficiency thinking he is suave. Dujardin plays it as a Clouseau that can keep itself by karate. The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook, who has disappeared mysteriously and contains such inappropriate options as a Nazi cell hidden inside a pyramid. If there is a crushing note, the leading lady, Berenice Bejo, has all the sensualities of a suet pudding and is darkened - but just right - by Aure Atika. It's good for a view, but it's about it.
