NORTHFORK is above all a masterpiece of widescreen filmography. For this alone, the movie is worth it for its time. The sharp, wide open plains and badlands of eastern Montana are trapped in the extra, subdued tones of the fall or early spring. The giant gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the film's protagonist. The film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen questions about the Western landscape. The dialogue can try at times, but images and concepts are strong enough to lift the movie. The 1950s period works so well here and performed as well. I think the last few years will be kind to this movie.
