To date, I believed there were only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980) as a masterpiece and perhaps the last great Western (since 1970), after Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and happy to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, like me. A recent book, The Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate. Through the production and the release, it was destroyed, like no movie since Cleopatra, almost twenty years earlier. At one point, it was considered the most expensive budget movie all the time and even passed Cleopatra. It was blamed for the study of his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios fell. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the deer hunter, was hated and despised for his success and films that made excess, but clearly, it was petty jealousy at worst. <br /> <br /> Cimino ended up dancing one of the great shows of the American experience. This film should not be missed, but any serious student in American filmmaking.
