This film is almost never seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it over and over is from a slightly worn VHS copy I made when the movie was shown on television in 1991 here in England. <br /> <br /> Of course, an ensemble cast enjoys itself and this is reflected to the viewer. A razor-sharp script helps things together, and once you've seen this, you'll want to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the "star" but everyone contributes to a great movie with a good jazz soundtrack to start. There are emotional moments during the film, but never to sick sweet sentimentalism - these are the guys on the journey of life, and they convey the excitement wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you can actually see it.
