I recently purchased this movie on DVD at a $ 5 discount store. Although it is a no-frills DVD on the Geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features) image - and the sound quality was excellent. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, whom I must admit to not hearing about, plays the pencil - Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight, but shouldn't do it! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the leading guy, also with the great charm he is known for. Bad, but with scruples as when he refuses to deny Pinky his "whack" for the job. Whack, in England, is apparently the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in American gangster movies! All it supports is an excellent piece of work that produces a very credible film. What is best for me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable (I often find myself lost in plot confusion and different characters) without any special effects. No blood No violence. Not even a car chase! Just a well-written story, well-acted, well-run and well-photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the music. What does bluegrass music do in a bank heist story that takes place in England?
