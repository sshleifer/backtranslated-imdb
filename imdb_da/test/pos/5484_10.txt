I just watched this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What a movie! This is the kind of movie you want everybody in the world to see because it's just so cold and so interesting. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go cold. DO NOT READ THIS SUMMARY before watching the movie! All I have to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and Jeff Maguire's manuscript are top notch. I wish all strings were more like this.
