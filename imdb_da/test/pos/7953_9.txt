I really appreciate what Jung-won had done before his death. Everything. I would like to say that his choice for love is selfless. If he chose Da-rim, it would be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Of course he won't let it happen. As he did in the movie, he chose to give up. So it was just temporary pain for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> By comparison, My Life Without Me is very different. Their behavior shows a big difference between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can't say what's better. Anyone can have the right to choose. It is up to you. Life is right for everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if you only think it suits you. <br /> <br /> In fact, the slow pace of the movie cannot be the excuse to reject the movie. Just calm down. You get more of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've ever seen. 9.10
