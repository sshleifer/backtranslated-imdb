I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt on a plot that he resumed later in his career. Possibly the most amazing thing about how faceless main characters are. After seeing, you remember Murray Alper as the joyful truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touching tour as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable travel freak show and of course Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom exceed Bob Cummings quite as a wood refugee ( compare the bridge jump to Harrison Ford's similar stunt in Andrew Davis 'The Fugitive' and Priscilla Lane, whose change of heart and subsequent love for Cummings is never entirely credible. <br /> <br /> Of course, the other big support player is Hitchcock himself who is booking the movie with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many criticize the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with the lack of technology, even trying and conveying what the director wants to show is a great achievement. Of course, this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the Second World War, but being a Hitchcock is never the most important and the emphasis is always on the action. Worth checking out, especially for support roles.
