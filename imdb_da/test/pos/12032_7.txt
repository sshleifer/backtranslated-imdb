Hollywood has transformed the mafia into a production line of production, ranging from banal to excellent and despite some good actors and a sensible script (many of which are - for a change - true!) This "home entertainment" effort must fall slack in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checklists stop crossing), but spends a lot of time creating a pastiche of the best of others' work. Godfather is the most obvious, but there are also other references. I won't bother naming them. Nevertheless, it is a good taste borrower! The producer seems to put a quota for shots and murders (at least every 20 minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" I am told that there are different versions of this production, so maybe it's just the version I've seen. <br /> <br /> Gangster doesn't make money, they take money. Usually for fear. Some look more like the murder and the chaos side of the business than making money. They were the ones who were the first to go (in fact and here). "You can't make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano at some point. One of the smarter gangsters, though all things are relative. He was a skilled white slave dealer and a drug dealer before being brought home to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school "moustached Pete's" was picked up by the new blood that wanted power and money for itself and to break free from the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely doing business outside itself ). The young Turk knew that they had to be allied with other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to launder money) and that is at least referred to and recognized. What is not made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia - but most of them put their money and went legit. And why not? Who will die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man who was willing to kill if needed but not an unjust or stupid. His story was tragic because he could have made money in the ground over the earth, and he showed a special skill to avoid being killed. Despite the number of respectable names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), there is no charisma or talent to bring us in and feel anything. We are - just - passive observers in a life we ​​are happy not to have led. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only trademark was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can't get enough of the gangster genre, it will be better than seeing Godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time, and it's even better - as basic entertainment - than the horrible misfire there was Godfather 3.
