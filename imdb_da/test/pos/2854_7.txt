Smaller spoiler follows, but nothing you haven't learned from reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Along with a wonderful central performance by Ren√©e Zellweger, nurse Betty is a dark but stunningly good-natured comedy. <br /> <br /> A bit of an emotional and psychological breakdown after witnessing his sleazy man's murder, already worried and desperately unhappy waitress, Betty is convinced that a sign of her favorite date lip is her far-lost fiance and sits down from Kansas to Hollywood to find him. <br /> <br /> Instead of joking at the expense of Betty's mental state, author John C. Richards is very sympathetic, as Zellweger portrays her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable anyway. Critically, she is never really a victim in spite of this, and although she is undoubtedly motivated by the characters who treat her badly, everyone is understandable - even Greg Kinnear as the subject of her fake feelings can be a selfish, flashing, arrogant pig, But he really thinks she's just a quirky wannabe actress with talent bags rather than an insane stalker. <br /> <br /> The Pharisee end, where all the protagonists descend in the same place (in this case Betty's house) at the same time to get it out is as old as the cinema itself, but it works quite well here, though the shift in tone is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is strongly supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, both of whom work hard and are particularly pleased to see Chris Rock show restraint in his earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> Not nearly as cruel as you might expect, and not at all crazy, is nurse Betty - far from being ridiculously solid entertainment elevated to someth intrusive more of the leading actress.
