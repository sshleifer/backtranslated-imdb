This was it! I would never have expected the end if I didn't already know the scenes. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was why Shannon was kicked off and not Alyssa. I hate her, I'd rather her character die that Shannon is. What was fun is that in the scene where the beeps die in the hospital and Prue cried next to the side, I began to cry for fun. at the time this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was piper from the beginning so i told myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> So go back in time things were a shocker and really good. I also blame Pheobe for Prue's death because, instead of being with her sisters, she had to be a slim bitch and be with her good for nothing demon girlfriend. <br /> <br /> But I think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed be!
