This movie has everything that goes for it: Fully developed characters, a realistic depiction of working Washington, bathed in warmth and humor, uniquely Albert Brooks. Dumbing down of network news is even more a problem now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! So satisfying to look after complex people who are trying to achieve complex goals - and it all goes along with the speed of lightning. Such a true life-image of friendships that tease romance. See if you can see John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from Real Broadcast News? Finally, if you are from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions for cabs!
