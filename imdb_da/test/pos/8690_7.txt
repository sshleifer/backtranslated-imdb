With a look that could kill and a willingness to show her charm, Paget's sensuality leaves no doubt where her assets lay ... She plays a sultry-innocent 13th-century princess praising her people for saving Egypt from the ambitions of a powerful Bedouin (Michael Rennie) and joining her forces with the son of the caliph Baghdad (Jeffrey Hunter) to save his screaming throne ...

Her juicy legs makes her hard to forget! <br /> <br /> The emphasis is not on the plot, but on the visual delight of a large number of beautiful girls in sensual Technicolored costumes ...
