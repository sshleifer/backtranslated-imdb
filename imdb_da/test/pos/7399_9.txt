Where do I start, I like the scary monster called Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would be back and he was. Changing the room to a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a good job as Jack Frost, you can see when an actor is having fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the show. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome successor who is better than the first. I have a complaint, the little Jacks or Jacklings that I call them. They looked like puppets. I think they could have done a better job with Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but CGI was good, and overall, the whole movie is worth seeing over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you would like this sequel. No questions or debate, 9 GREAT STARS.
