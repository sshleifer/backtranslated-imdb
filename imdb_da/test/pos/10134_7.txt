Not much to it, but a validation of small town values ​​and the embrace of a mentally challenged young man in his heart. <br /> <br /> I read some of the reviews and was surprised by some of the hostility it created. I felt that Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect as opposed to Sean Penn's swirling foal image in "I'm Sam." <br /> <br /> The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all more heart-warming. Sport is taken seriously in small town high school America (and elsewhere, I suppose), and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to a less fortunate rank true, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio, but rather came to the decision even in the radio's loving and open ways. Very well done for everyone. 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
