I think the problem with this show doesn't get the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and for friends. The three sitcoms were star shows of their time. <br /> <br /> At the end of this special time, KOQs came on television. <br /> <br /> But don't let that happen. <br /> <br /> The King of Queens is as good as not better than two of the three mentioned. Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed as hard as I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs come really close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laugh, I have to judge KOQs second only to Seinfeld. ELR has to be different, although the character creation and interaction is more endearing. <br /> <br /> No matter how, KOQ's top ten has been in the last 20 years. The only other sitcom worth mentioning now are two and a half men who really don't hold a candle to the other four, but that's all we've left.
