I have loved this movie for a long time. I hadn't seen it for a while so I checked it out again and found it even more enjoyable now. I loved Chipmunks cartoon when I was young, so of course I adored 'The Chipmunk Adventure.' <br /> <br /> I honestly can't think of a better plot for this movie. It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel all over the world, and then I have as much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. That part with Elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry ... "Chipmunk Adventure" will remain a favorite for me forever, I'm sure. I think that's because I saw it when I was so young. I don't think it would have an impact on an elder who sees it for the first time. (Unless of course they have a young heart)
