Colombian terrorists hold hostages to a US military school until their claims are met. Students decide to fight back. Will they be able to do that? <br /> <br /> Silly premise, but the movie actually works. The group of children fighting, all came and came when this movie came out in 1991: Sean Astin (looks very cute); Wil Wheaton (looks miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (token Latino who is very nice, very muscular and is mostly shown in no but tight underwear); TEA. Russell (the token black guy) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is a thoughtless action movie. The only other good performances are from Denholm Elliott (with a ball as principal) and Louis Gossett Jr. as dean. <br /> <br /> Other than that - there's lots of action, excitement, explosions and little brains. In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and this is less) - it's a little too long (there are three inferences) and there's lots of casual, bloody violence (the R value was well deserved). Still, I enjoyed it very much.
