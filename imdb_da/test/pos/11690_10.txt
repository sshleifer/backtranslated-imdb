First, I must admit that I have doubts about the director. He has made some films (with Jarkovsky) about the recent "Czech = East" story or more precisely about families (individuals), how did they survive some historical moments. But it was always like Chinese food sour-sweet. This movie was completely different. It was clean, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human nature. This movie is an excellent piece of art (history, acting, image, music), but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don't want to see. By the way, I've seen it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid I in the US won't be able to do it.
