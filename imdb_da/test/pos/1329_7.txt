Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> "If you steal fifty million dollars, they'll find you." (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This proverb certainly calls in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been told that Danny Ocean and his companions were the ones who dropped him off and now he wants it all back. The Ocean band needs a lot of money and fast, but can't work in the states, as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it is out to Europe to kill death that thaws the theft while trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super politician, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. <br /> <br /> On their first heist in Amsterdam, they find out who hit them was "Night Fox", a super slick thief with a playful complex. He issues them with a challenge that could fully depreciate their debts or land them in a form of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II buried-living sequence. Interesting? So yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Lots. <br /> <br /> Ocean and his ties of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else, and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends, we see lots more "pally" situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​choke as we knew they would; Bernie Mac speaks too much, and Don Cheadle's cock-no accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle but couldn't comply with that). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, fill each other's glasses and read each other's minds. But what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development compared to how smoothly the whole curse was. And as much as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this movie as a large square stick in a tight 11 sided hole. She simply doesn't fit, and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, the stars of this movie were Vincent Cassel as Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of places. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he were born in both. His Night Fox is arrogant, "terribly cavalier with the lives of others" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean band. This is where I think the movie is losing its way. Cassel and the European sites give a far too realistic contrast to the American actors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Admittingly, you can't repeat the same formula twice for the letter, but going far to the left or right usually does more harm than good in a regular movie like this one.
