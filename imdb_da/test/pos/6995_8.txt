This movie is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over - the Posiedan adventure in space. The characters are all stock characters - celebrating heroine, Judas, sweep, etc. The only question is really who is next to snuff it. Sometimes these are proven formal works - as in this case - but more often not - as the truly mind-numbing "Red Planet". <br /> <br /> So why does this work? Because it's stylish. The action is above average. And above all, it is not predictable. The conclusion is not signed. I really had no idea how it all would end and was surprised at how it ended. It alone deserves top marks in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting and entertaining movie. And although it was never likely to change the cinema's face as we know it, it does not disappoint.
