This is a good flick! It's fun for everyone, even adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface who murder in this along with other crazy characters. Very fun flick, for kids of all ages. Must be rented here every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good couple and have to love the other. He's probably my favorite character! I was never big on the TV show, but this movie brings back only so many good memories. Must see for families, fans of the show or anyone! Enjoyable, no matter how small or old you are! Rent it now in your local video store! <br /> <br /> P.S. Need a DVD release!
