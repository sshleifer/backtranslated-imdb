I saw it this week it opened four years ago and I really didn't know what to expect to be unaware of Sorrentino's work at that time. He has created a very exciting and ultimately moving statement of a strange character, one for whom the term "life is for living" no longer applies. It surrendered to me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story. I enjoyed much of the pacing and the way I gradually got the pieces to find out what happened. Tony Servillo is great, like Magnani. It opens with an excellent stylish wide shot and ends with a very moving image that takes the film to sublime territory. I thought long ago about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and I didn't shake it for weeks. I recently bought the movie and the last scene where he thinks his friend gets me every time. I still don't have to talk to anyone who's seen this. It is a pity that it did not reach a wider audience, as if it were the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
