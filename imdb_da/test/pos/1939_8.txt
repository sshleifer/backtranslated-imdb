River's Edge is more than just the story of a murder. It is an accusation of the wave of apathy that has plagued young pockets for decades now. Our protagonists are a group of what my high school would have referred to as "stoners". One of them just decided to choke his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to "talk to him". This dangerous young man, played by Daniel Roebuck, has an intensity that will scare you. He takes the other children in the group out to show them his dearest body, and oddly enough, it doesn't seem to really matter. The film's balance reflects the desperate circumstances in which these people live and how the blame is ultimately capable of cheating on themselves in these apathetic children. River's Edge certainly does not allow the behavior of its characters to operate. We clearly see the dangers arising from such uncontrolled apathy and only want to be full or full. We are shown the dysfunctional home life these children have, and perhaps it is supposed to explain their terrible behavior. But can it only be unstable homes that lead to this kind of destructive way of life? Crispin Glover is his usual whacked-out self. He is driving around the city in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. He tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but he clearly does not understand what could have caused the young man to do so. Dennis Hopper plays an older man these kids get their dope from. Although he is definitely a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the younger generation's apathy and anger. Witnessing his confused reaction as Roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. As wild as Hopper's character is, even he knows that this young man should not go to earth. <br /> <br /> What do you think of these children? Well, there really is no way to like their characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can't help either hating or undoing them. Twenty years later, many young people out there are still alive and well alive. When are these children lost? What makes so many of them want to act anti-social? This movie, and the questions it poses about teenagers, hold you for a while. It is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. The dog.
