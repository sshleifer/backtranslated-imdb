I must say that I know documentary films from Mr Ã–rnek, and then I knew that I would get a very well made film documentary. I was not disappointed. As a historian, I experienced hundreds of documentaries and liked the different approaches to this work. The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipolie through sunglasses from both sides. Then the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> Narrated is this docu by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both increasing the intensity and emotionality of this documentary with their large voices. <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a movie theater in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought DVD last year and will be waiting again 3-7 years for the next talented director and his very good documentaries. Summary: Well done. Intense. History with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
