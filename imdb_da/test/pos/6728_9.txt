This movie has "haunted" me since I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn't know what it was called, so I'm so happy to have finally tracked it down. I remember being scared, because I had just been in a tin mine in Cornwall, when I saw it, so could imagine it all. Luckily I saw no ghosts of dead children there, but I found this movie really alarming and frightening when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, even though I couldn't find it anywhere. I think remembering The Children's Film Foundation movies is generally good, but they don't show them at all. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe in the same era on the BBC - just as disturbing in their own way.
