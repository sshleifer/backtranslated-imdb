"Hi, I ordered no cabin!" "Yes, you have a ..." What can I say about Hack ... which man among men. He was a hired ex-cop turning the lead with a heart of gold. If you could (and fortunately for American television viewers ... a person a week) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, then you saw a caring man devoted to vigilant justice. The show was amazing, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms would break into goose bids when our dear friend Hack wanted to leave his cabin in another dark alley ... with nothing more than his fists ... ready to avenge a wronged civilian. A smile would break out on my face as the screen showed me a criminal in a dark grass facial expression when Taxi of Justice's headlights illuminated his face. Week after week, I canceled my duties as President of the Klingon Association to bask in the warm glow of Hack's brilliance. I have never seen a better show and I took care of the loss of one of America's greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I would like to inform the world that my wife and I expect Hack Koen to enter the world in three weeks.
