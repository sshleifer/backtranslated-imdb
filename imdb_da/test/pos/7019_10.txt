When dirty dance was on TV in the middle of last year I was out, so I couldn't see it, my mother swore I had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere. At least to the point she couldn't find her video for Christmas, I bought her the DVD, yes she hasn't looked in. It was about a while, when one night I decided to take it upstairs to see and I fell in love with it. This is a great movie with lots of lovely scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! It's certainly not for everyone, but if you love a love story, you'll want to see Dirty Dancing over and over again! Dirty Dancing - The way love is supposed to be!
