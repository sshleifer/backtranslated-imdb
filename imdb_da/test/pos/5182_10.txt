I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater while in New York City and was quite taken. The performance of William Hall Jr. is huge. This is a movie for the classic movie gallery. Garrett Bennett's direction reminds me of early Barry Levinson's and Robert Redford's work. The movie seems to exceed the typical independent film. It has a soul and a visual force that is completely unique. I saw this with a small audience (400) who was imprisoned from the first credit to the last, and even though I was not out and about, weeping (like the lady next to me), I must admit that I had a little watering in the eyes ... <br /> <br />
