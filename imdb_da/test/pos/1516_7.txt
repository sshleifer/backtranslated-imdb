I don't know exactly what it is, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf without thinking about leaving me ... Fulci has made one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well-made movies I ' ve ever seen. Not sure what is more to say about it but I love this movie !!! The steak tartar scene is completely outrageous, and the whole Nazi torture orgy failure is oddly fun ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with "screaming"? "Cat in the brain" is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere ... Yes I will definitely say it is not a "good" movie, but I guarantee some scenes will stick to your mind forever! This is an exercise in madness, people ... I think if I was a "serious" critic, I would give it a 3 but on pure pleasure (again I can't really explain my feelings) I would give it a 7 .... Really whacked out flick ...
