I watched this movie on the A&E channel last weekend. The mystery was okay, I couldn't guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery about some of them, especially George Abernathie, performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin Susannah. In fact, the story of these two characters left me wanting to know more. From what I have tried to delight in the Agatha Christie book with the same title, I think this movie did not follow it with the letter. Very good performance by the players involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion.
