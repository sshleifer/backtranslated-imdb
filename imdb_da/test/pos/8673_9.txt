What we have here is a movie that is perfect for anyone participating in the world of post-industrialism: those who sit in their privatized home make money by buying and selling sensual goods and maintaining a system that is not worthy of another than the preservation of self. The beautiful movie recording (I appreciate the fix 35s and soft boxes) makes it an even more alien place to travel through, both comfortable to look at but frightening to understand (maybe it's too dramatic, but its true). <br /> <br /> Andreas's journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. His quest is honorable, honorable, and precious. The conclusion is necessary and we are not quite sure if he is better, which is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Letters! Highly recommended to all people who see their world with a critical eye and especially to those who do not (perhaps it will encourage reflection or two).
