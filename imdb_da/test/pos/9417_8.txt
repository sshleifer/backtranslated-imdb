Sherlock Holmes movies from the classic universal era tend to vary in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their outputs unpleasant or amazingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit in well with the mid-quality and, as always, are an enjoyable excursion that fans of the series, like myself, will enjoy. This film sees Holmes in the midst of a World War II by the evil Nazis to steal a Swiss scientist's invention, which may prove to be a key element of the battlefield. World 2 World War II Sherlock Holmes films do not tend to be as good as those of The Scarlet Claw, where Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are usually pursued by too much propaganda or more plot-related plot war than the mystery. However, this is pretty much away from both and by focusing on Holmes and his study, the film works much better. Perhaps Universal saw what brought down the former Terror Voice and changed its focus because of it. <br /> <br /> Once again, Basil Rathbone puts an excellent maverick performance as the essence and while Nigel Bruce is not as much as usual, it's nice to see him when he does. The two did not spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes films; but it gives more time to Holmes for showboat in different aprons, which is always very fun. Dennis Hoeys Lestrade is certainly my favorite of secondary characters, and while he is not as fun as usual; His facial expression is great, and his presence helps emphasize how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car after paint drops on the road is my favorite moment in the movie. It is good to see Holmes nemesis, Professor Moriarty back, although it seems that he has just been thrown in for hell of it. Lionel Atwill's performance is not as good as George Zucco's in Sherlock Holme's adventure, as he never really convinces that he really is a brilliant mind; But watching him lock horns with the protagonist is fun, and it's nice to see him in the movie to compensate for World War II themes that are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The movie starts out as more of a thriller than a mystery game; But when it comes, it's hard to lay down, and this is a more than solid entry into the universe's oeuvre.
