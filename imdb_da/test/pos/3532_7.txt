I had delayed buying this one since its DVD release ?? for one thing, because I had been a little underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for doing on Media Blasters / Shriek View 2-Disc Set! I now chanced on it as a rental and am glad I did ?? because it is not only better than the previous effort (at least on this preliminary assessment), but I also found the film to be one of the better imitations of THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). However, this factor has only helped to recall that I have not yet checked another such example? Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I bought some time ago, but after all, the Halloween time is approaching ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie controls an effortless backwoods atmosphere (it was shot in the woods and mountainous Oregon) ?? with lots of effective friezes all the way through, but fortunately not too much violence (although the last of the bad guys are sent in a scandalous way!). The most important young cast here (one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) is not as uncomfortable as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offer? Despite being freely pampered in one, you associate with teen-oriented flicks and that largely persist to this day! George Kennedy looks like a sympathetic ranger; Although he does not have much to do, his characterization is certainly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also noteworthy among the locals is the well-known character actor Mike Kellin in a good role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the story ?? Of course, his warning to teenagers goes unrestrained, but he can later lead Kennedy to them. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family of teenagers cross the forest, eventually revealing a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls shows real curiosity to the intruders, the rest are obviously hostile to them? and in the case of the burly and uncouth twins, appropriately frightening (one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages); At some point in the story, Ranger even offers an interesting explanation of the nature of their aggressive and generally unconscious behavior.
