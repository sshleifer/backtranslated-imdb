I'm amazed and appalled by the number of reviewers on this site who didn't get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black / white relationships or old / young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately forged both elements to adapt imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex abuse, although Christina Ricci's character, Rae, characterizes them. It is not about popular religion in the black community, although religion plays a major role. It is not a love story, even though there is not one but two happy couples in the end. And it is certainly not about the south, where "everything is warmer", even though it is in the south and it is unthinkable hot; Holy smokers, even tag-line writers did not get the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable of the Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they play about how it heals them. <br /> <br /> It's as if filmmakers sat down with an empty slate and asked, "Okay, if we were to help people understand what Blues really is about, how would it look?" it in rural areas south. Then they dream up two characters, one of his wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war, and his poorly abused girl sleeps with everyone in the city. Then we throw into grizzled worldliness that is just touched by popular religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and even though they respect him, they know they can't give it to him), some violence between men and women and much and much of steaming sexual images, including - ready to go over the top? - A black man in a sleeveless undershirt with a half-naked white girl in captivity at the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it a true blues picker, use music as the main healing element of the plot, flip clips of blues-man Son House at both ends and Voila - you have a modern parable of what Blues is about . Even the film's climax is not a sign conflict, but the whole city dances steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable desire and is healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) domestic religion and stubbornness (and don't forget the chain.) But then we are shown the restored Rae dancing to the blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force or just of the same blurry behavior that destroyed her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but the blues are really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives a good expression of both (sex and violence) without loosening either. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we are looking at Samuel L Jackson; The man is incredibly good. He even selects some of his own tunes in the movie, and his game is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is usually not that good either. Well, half her work is done by the costume that was not there and her slimy figure, but she is a great combination of cynical desire, rebellion and vulnerability; bravo to her, she has arrived. I was impressed by the landlord John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he is a professional actor and not a real minister. Parents should be aware of what they get their children to bring this home. The language is quite far from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are broken in a dozen ways during the movie (Lazarus means good and is decent, but honestly chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus user Ricci half of the movie dressed for sex; If you have teenage boys, they will lick the screen halfway into the movie. I do not recommend this for children of all ages. Adults only, thank you. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Black Snake Moan is informative and precise about blues, popular religion and sexual abuse, and tells a story that is redemptive in many ways. It's unorthodox, but it's worth the time. And my goodness is the soundtrack hot.
