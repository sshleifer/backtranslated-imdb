I like this movie over everyone else. It's "multi-layered"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Each view provides a new understanding of the story, plot and characters. Flawlessly acted and extremely comfortable if you take the time to see it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between players; the subtle relationships; period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the exciting lover and Geoffrey the vicious man is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm, where Catherine & El-masy discusses the different types of sandstorm, is one of the highlights of the film and where the affair really starts. The second relationship between Hanna & El-masy is another "layer" of the film, which is absolutely enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards.
