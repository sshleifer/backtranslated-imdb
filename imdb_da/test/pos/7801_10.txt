Andaz Apna Apna is a movie, I treasure and one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time ... well almost anytime! This movie is simply amazing and according to me is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I put it over Hera Pheri ... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you want to watch out for, but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because each scene is a scene to watch out for! Aamir & Salman shares great chemistry and is perfect in their shoes, but I put the characters behind favoritism: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. is an innocent character belonging to the reputable family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible, beautiful, charismatic charming son. Gogo, making life's biggest mistake by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is like Balla once said "A fraud and a cheat!"). Now Gogo's only goal is to get back what is his and in his journey to recover his lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 he needs to achieve and thus begins ... Gogo's battle against the world of sinners. /> Placement # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is a vicious character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chose to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, when a child had always envied his brother and then one day, took things worse when his father gave his whole wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father, but in the dark of the night he instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father), although Teja did not regret his actions. Teja's only mission is now to get back to his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery. Teja must also return the loan to Gogo (but has no intention at all to do so). To reach his evil goals, Teja has two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son ... who is a very very smart boy!) <Br /> <br /> Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Will marry the rich heiress Raveena so he sells his father's cheap salon and head out to Mumbai. Amar has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will persuade him after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and switch to London if necessary. Placement # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character expressed in the movie, and the way Amar tries to exploit him in a friend's mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I didn't reveal more signs because Jesus Christ! I just didn't want to stop writing! The movie is amazing! Go and take the DVD now and watch out for the cheap VCDs, as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie. The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final meeting between Prem and the Crimean Master Gogo (watch it), it appears in climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive signs and teaches us a lot about life and values ​​and ethics. It teaches us bravery (why should Amar ask Prem to stay when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained he had to go to the toilet ???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially those scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and gets overdose of abdominal pain. The part where Teja reveals his sad feelings, why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested at the end, without even coming back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is a complete package .... sit back and enjoy the trip! Rate there will be another trip after that ... and then a third! The movie was considered a flop again then, and I bet no one liked it but buckle guys! This movie is a big hit! Though it didn't have enough people to come to theaters, the movie is one of the best-selling home boxes and one of the most common movies on most channels, so manufacturers have eased their way to the banks long ago!
