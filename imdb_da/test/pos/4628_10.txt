It was riveting. I just couldn't look away. As the movie rolled on, I began to feel it was heavy and confronted, but I had no idea how much more intense it would be. <br /> <br /> The film gives an insight into what, unfortunately, is the everyday life of many school children. Some of us live outside this environment and will pass by and not know what happens. Parents should especially watch this movie just to see a glimpse of what their children are going through. Often, parents reject their children problems as trivial, but unfortunately for a high schooler they are massive. And, unfortunately, the problems can escalate into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely look for everyone.
