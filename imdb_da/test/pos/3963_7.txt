This movie has something that most other movies in its genre do not do: intelligence and good news. Accepted, is the story of a child named Bartleby (Justin Long), who is rejected by every college he uses. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a couple of other students facing similar problems start a fake college to pawn themselves to their parents like college kids. Not everything goes to planning and the movie is about them. But behind this plot, which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new perspective on the American education system. The College they create "South Harmon Institute of Technology" accepts those who were not accepted elsewhere. The message is that you don't need "money, tradition or fancy book - you just need a desire to improve yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that it is still OK and different (whether it is a person or a school) is not necessarily bad and that anybody should be given the opportunity to improve themselves - despite whether they are 'strange'. It is a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well. But not only are messages great - it's fun! haha i laughed very hard. Humor can be subtle but can also be blatant, and it is a wonderful mix. Brothers beware.
