In the late 1940s there was a short film series titled "Flicker Flashbacks", where excerpts from silent dramas with Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were played by grin. Scratchy clips from ancient old movies were rearranged, projected too quickly and overlaid with jangly music and lame quips. The attitude expressed by this brutal treatment certainly summed up the mid-century's view of Hollywood's early days: silent cinema was considered hokey, florid, a little embarrassing and merely good for a chuckle. In the 1950s, this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 essay on the silence of Life Magazine was a factor, but the television played a major role in reakquainting viewers with silent movies. Admittedly, the television network sometimes handled the material as cruel as the "Flicker Flashbacks" people, but higher toned series such as "Silents, Please" treated the films with respect. Another milestone was Robert Youngson's compilation THE GOLDEN EVENTHOME KOMEDY, which turned out to be a surprising hit when it was released in theaters late in 1957. I don't know if Charles Chaplin was aware of Youngson's movie or its success at the cashier's office but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, A DOG'S LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both made in 1918) and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922 and released the following year). These three films came to work well as a trio, as they contrast well in plot, theme and setting. In addition, all three known faces from Chaplin's stock exchange, some of which play multiple roles in each card. At the time of the re-release, the films had not been publicly screened for over thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was concerned about maintaining its reputation with a new generation of filmmakers, especially since his best work rarely appeared on television in the early days of the new medium. Chaplin apparently concluded that the movies were moving too fast at the old silent projection rate, so it was decided to "stretch" them, which meant every second frame was printed twice. Perhaps he would avoid the "Flicker Flashbacks" look, but that was not the best way to go. Aesthetically, the results were horrible and virtually destroyed the film's action, but it was such that CHAPLIN REVUE was released to theaters in 1959, and that is the version that was uploaded to video and made commercially available by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. I bought a VHS copy of the movie at that time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stop-and-start rhythm of the movies. It's a special pleasure to find out that David Shepard's restoration of Chaplin's compilation (originally made for the laser disc format) is a major improvement over the Playhouse Video version. Mostly, the projection speed is corrected. "Stretch printing" is at least gone, though the action seems to be pulling a bit at times. For example: In a DOG's life under Edna & Charlie's unpleasant dance in the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare arms are visibly blurred; At another time, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is relieved of duty, the effect seems oddly slow in a moment, but it may be due to a maneuvering of the movie updates to cover a bit of degradation. All in all, the picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE begins with rare behind-the-scenes footage taken at the Chaplin studio. This includes shots of a naturally staged, jokey rehearsal session where Chaplin slips the smallest actor Loyal Underwood, as well as scenes of Charlie on his dressing table, putting on his makeup and trimming the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's story, delivered with a quick clip. Chaplin also composed a new musical point for the compilation, and in my opinion his themes for the REVUE were ranked with his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the cafe sequence in A HUNDS LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy song called "Bound for Texas" song' Fifties style by Matt Monro (rather like Gene Autry), which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place. Otherwise the music throughout the rest of REVUE is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere. It feels like the image release of CHAPLIN REVUE is somehow its long-postponed debut, presenting these classic comedies as the way they should be watched all the time. In this form, the RevUE ranking with Chaplin's most durable and comfortable works.
