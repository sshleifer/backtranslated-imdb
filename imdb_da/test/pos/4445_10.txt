"Don't Torture a Duck" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen and I've seen my share. Calling it is a giallo a little misleading because it is not a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and horrific scenes ever in a movie, this old, Fulci's twist and spin film oozes with an eerie mood and an Italian Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The final is genuine and original. <br /> <br /> Having seen "Don't Torture a Duck", you should really wonder how Fulci's later stuff became so striking. I like all his stuff, but he failed. Maybe he figured he was already doing it ... Because he with this movie hits bullseye. I would recommend this movie to anyone who believes Dario Argento owns the giallo genre. Fulci beats him with this one. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
