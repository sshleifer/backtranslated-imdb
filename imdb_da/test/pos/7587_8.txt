After viewing this card on VHS tape with the Summer Stock feature, I rewatch on the TCM site every Sunday. It marked the film debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and the 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teens exhibit their musical talents with a solo from Deanna of "Il Bacio", then one from Judy of "Waltz with a Swing" before the two climax with "Americana". The little plot of this 11-minute movie relates to the possible unemployment of Edna's (Durban's real first name, as she's addressed here), grandfather's leading job at the park because of low participation. With the help of the two girls, you can probably guess what happens from there! Contrast is marked not only by Garland's and Durbin's musical choices, but also by their height, poise and movement. Despite all that, they work quite well at the end and it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland while Durbin was already contracted at Universal when this short was made but was briefly allowed again as her feature debuted (Three Smart Girls) were early preparation for stages. Judy herself would make her first feature (Pigskin Parade) at 20th Century Fox when MGM decided which movie she wanted the next star in. It would be Broadway Melody from 1938 where she would perform the show stop number, "Dear Mr. Gable You Got me to love you) ". But back to this card, every Sunday gives a warm and wonderful glimpse of two-star singers at the beginning of their legendary career, unaware of what the future holds for them ...
