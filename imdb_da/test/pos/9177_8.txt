-Loves are hard to find in this fast food society that we live in, so called Hitch makes it a duty to help men find love with women that they are not crazy in love with. His rules are that he only helps you to find love and not just casual sex that seems like a lot, but soon words start to spread around, and people start to get the wrong idea of ​​what he is doing, beginning to complicate the relationship with the woman he just met that he is in love with. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from foreigners or robots. There are no jaw effects, nor does he show his smothered body. He is just a normal person in this movie, who was really nice. He does not necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie, but then again the story does not call it, but it was also fun to see him relaxed and not show his ripped body to make them us without six packages of jealousy. His character here is, like all his characters, sympathetic, witty and very charming, which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love story seem to share. The Kevin James character is just an ordinary guy who needs help joining the dream girl who really makes you aware of the guy and mess for him every step of the way. The only sign that was a sore spot for me was the Mendez character because she is so cold and calculated that it is hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. He must love a challenge I think. <br /> <br /> Now that's the part of the review where I want to make a joke on how I would never need Hitch because I'm such a player, but I just got through writing about 16 reviews to another website plus I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little abandoned right now. If the movie is filled with enough charm and similar characters with fun lines, it slowly falls into the sea of ​​formal romantic films, where after the big scene where the horrible secret comes out, everyone is forgiven, and the relationship is even better than before. But hey, like 4000 films about the underdog that overcomes adversity, so I think a movie with a predictable ending that has been made almost dead does not cause much harm. I also like the movie from the movie because ultimately you don't need a formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and everything will fall into play, which is the theme of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if it turned out that the James character gets the girl following all that the Smith character said, then it would be a pretty blank movie, but as it stands, it works really well. <br /> <br /> - Although predictable, it is a PERFECT movie. It's cute, it's fun, and it's romantic, so anyone looking at this movie on a date must get something after it's over. And some I mean sex
