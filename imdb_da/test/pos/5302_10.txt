This is the latest Ghibli movie, and it is also a great departure from the studio's established style. First of all, this film was of course aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of the other movies and has a brand new far less realistic form of animation? and yet it is ever so entertaining. Although there is nothing to attract adults, I still found myself drawn on the screen and completely immersed in history. The film's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are much in advance with their feelings / intentions, etc. But that makes them even more endless. Particular attention was also paid to the soundtrack, which is fantastic despite the fact that it is different from the previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing the sweet theme song all the time, who wants anyone watching this movie!
