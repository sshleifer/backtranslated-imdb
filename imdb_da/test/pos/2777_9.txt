Although it's not the most technically advanced movie I've seen, it was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. The main characters are cute, and you really like them and feel something when Susie Q. is going, but feels good again when she returns like Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of stock dialogue and a constructed plot line, but most of all, lots of fun.
