Hadnt heard much about this movie, except that it was the National Award and Oscar entry. It's a marathi movie, I can't get an apple from orange in marathi. But when I saw the movie playing on DD1 late Sunday evening, I just got glued. Now I am no judge of film techniques and action skills. But I've seen a large number of movies, of different genres, and for an average viewer, I highly recommend this movie. The feeling is very earthly and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. See it to feel it human. Most recently, no movie has touched the heart, especially in Hindi cinema. The chronic performance of the movie is when the young child returns. The camera moves around to reveal the baby, wearing black glasses, has lost his eyes, the child hears the other children splashing in the water and begins to pat. I was awestruck. And the two hours I used to watch the movie - much worth it :-)
