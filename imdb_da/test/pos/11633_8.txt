I don't understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, don't see it! It's stupid how everyone changes "I love you" son to "I hate you." If you don't like that, fine. Whatever it is your opinion. But there is no need to break down the show when it isn't even so bad. Ok, so its corny, and yes, it has its faults but it's a kids show. Children will not be sad and miserable, they will be happy. And Barney helps it. And even in the show there are moments of sadness and anger and etc. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the children see Barney as a fantasy character. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and hard place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does it for us. This show is amazing. I looked at Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I saw it, and I'm at the top of my class. It may not necessarily make you smarter, but it's not the intention. I think Barney's point is to create a place where children can be children and the childhood spirit can be expressed. Where the imagination lives on. So many teenagers are now imaginative and afraid to express themselves. Barney helps to encourage it. Barney helped me not to be scared and just show myself to who I am. I am a sophomore in high school now, an AP student with a 4.0, a drama student with love for theater and art, and with a new cousin who loves Barney. I see it with him and enjoy it and sing with it. Yes, it's corny and silly, and anything, but it's good for kids. Who wants to be an adult who doesn't have the time to have fun? I am a child of heart and I love Barney. It is great for kids and those who are a child of the heart. It's a great show for babies and toddlers. Then stop hating. Say you don't like it, but stop it with "Dumbest show ever" or "Barneys a load of bull" or whatever. Keep it to yourself. Take a chill pill or whatever. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you can't see me go: "Grover is a load of bull" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all the BULLSS ** T people say about books or movies, like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, OK, whatever. Nobody cares. Don't say that hate things about it, cuz you can just offend someone.
