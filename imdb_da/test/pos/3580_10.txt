An amazing look at the sea and life in it. <br /> <br /> The good thing: <br /> <br /> Camera work was quite phenomenal. Each shot is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals that I could never imagine. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done anything better. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> There was one or two different times when there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old (I hold another belief). <br /> <br /> All in all, a TV series that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
