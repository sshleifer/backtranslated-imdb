Set in Bam Margera's hometown of Westchester PA, 'Haggard' is a semi-true story of the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn has been dumped by his 2-year-old girlfriend, the Glauren, who now sees a beer rinse, long-haired metal head named 'Hellboy', and it runs Dunn sindssy with jealousy. In a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what goes on between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into her house and provide evidence of the affair, with some disastrous results for all concerned! I found this movie a lot of fun, maybe partly because I am a unified Jackass and CKY fan, and it must be said that a lot of humor is likely to be lost on those who do not have prior knowledge of Margera's crazy brand of "comedy." br /> <br /> The film features a lot of interest for skaters, not least cameo appearance skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk as a police officer, and there are also Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis, and Bam's long-suffering parents, April. and Phil. <br /> <br /> The DVD extras include music videos from CKY (with Bam's Brother Jess on drums) and Bams favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the movie takes its name from HIM frontman Ville Vallo). also a documentary and a "for hot for jackass" shit. In summary, as I said before, this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I feel that Margera and co have made a lot of effort with " Haggard 'and I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.
