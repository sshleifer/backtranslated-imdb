I bought this a while back during a massive martial arts phase. Although this is certainly not the best, I love this kind of film production, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that he normally has not managed martial arts while he lacked a formal martial arts training. He also has a good beard. This film has him in a good, heroic role, and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other films, he still rejects himself well. Early performances by Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also good to see, especially because Chow Yun Fat takes the evil guys without his trademark gun. He must not be a great fighter, but he does well. Eddy Ko is just as big a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villain as in many of his other films and does well as usual. The guy who plays Bu is also good, I can't remember his name, but he's also in the Magnificent Butcher. Although the fighting is not as good as other films in the era, Postman fights back with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely splendid mood. There are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents that all come together for decent effect. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers movies, or as a crowd gratifying as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock solid entertainment.
