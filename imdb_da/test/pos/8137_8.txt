What are the movies? I mean ... what are movies made for? Shootings? Killing? NONE. They are made for life stories, and that's what this movie does. It presents how life has changed for two years. Father and son, father needs a job and asks his son for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are some characteristics that remain including the family caress. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the main topic is love for the son of the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The movie is ONLY a dialogue, but the dialogue is more than I could ever have wanted. This movie is a pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu delivers us another beautiful movie. Well done !
