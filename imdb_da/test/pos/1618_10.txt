OK, I'm a sucker. I loved it. I had no expectations and got them all met. It was a horrible movie. I loved it. I have managed to carry a DVD from over use. No one can understand my obsession. Nor can I tell the truth. For those who have seen the movie, it comes as no surprise, but I asked the clerk on the video store if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had been checked out and over half of the time it had been for me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is horrible. The special effects are terrible. The action is horrible, but I loved it. The actors are stupid, the plot is stupid, they many times - like seeing through monsters. The "arachnids" looked as if they were made of plastic waste bags (maybe they were). There was light underground, TNT wasn You really have to love B movies to enjoy this ... alcohol helps tremendously for others.
