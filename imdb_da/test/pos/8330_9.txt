We bought the DVD "Walking with Dinosaurs" and have been almost ecstatic about the things being done so well on it. Many DVDs today offer the pure minimum ... the feature itself and perhaps another language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to watch the DVD in multiple markets). <br /> <br /> Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful extras and well-considered vignettes that see the * navigation menu * interesting. Intros to each chapter of the "Making Of" DVD is ridiculously fun. The quality of audio and video is great. And of course, the story and the content ... what more can a dinosaur love ask for? <br /> <br /> I saw most of the version released on TDC (told by Avery Brooks) and about half of the DVD (told by Kenneth Branaugh). As far as I can tell, the broadcast version struck in a series of mostly American slang terms in the story (ie in a section on T. Rex mating, Branugh says "the woman is tiring of the man's attention" and Brooks says "Honeymoon is over" ) and cut out some of the closer puppet work. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, great value and wonderful production. many kudos to the BBC and the crew who made this gem.
