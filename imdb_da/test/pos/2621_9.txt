Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from Sauce's Assassin Shax. While Phoebe sees in the Shadow Book how to overcome the demon, Prue and Piper are fighting and chasing Shax on the street to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national emotions with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and return while a fanatic woman shakes Piper who dies. The source suggests Phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save his sister. Phoebe accepts the deal and the time comes back to the moment Shax attacks Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffiths. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. With Piper's death and The Power of Three destroyed, why should The Source return to save her? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best in the third season and lets viewers wait for the next episode. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in Time")
