In "The Squire of Gothos" Kirk and his crew meet a strong super-creature who holds the captain, "Bones" and a few crew members in captivity for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think it's the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen and the program that made me hungry for more. It's not one of the best episodes, but the grand premise of a foreign being that puts Enterprise's crew in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so fun to see. That way, super-humanoid expects one of Star Trek's most famous characters, Next Generation's enigmatic "Q". This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: This is the first time that Uhura is part of the action, and history allows the viewer to see what a welcoming character Uhuara can be when history allows her. Too bad the show did not quite explore this iconic figure.
