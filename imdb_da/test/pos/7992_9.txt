1992's "Batman Returns" was Tim Burton's second round as director and once again he scored a hit by making this movie again dark and gloomy as his 1989 one. Gotham City is once again a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out of every street corner. It was also wise to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that ties well and nicely with business corruption by businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to make Gotham's "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) mayor! Still, Keaton returns as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne, and he gives another star performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world, but he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own which is very slinky and she is just a straightforward vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all, both want to get rid of bats. Really this movie, though fierce and somewhat rough with many penguin scenes, is clearly an exciting start to finish thrill ride as you never find a dull moment and thumb up to Tim again for his exploration of the dark and conflicting characters made movies even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever since no one could have played "The Catwoman" any better, and Devito was perfect as "Penguin" his body frame fits the character, just perfect his performance, though ghoulish was fun to watch. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining thrill ride that you cannot take your eyes off as a seer, you will enjoy it many times, it is so exciting and explosive.
