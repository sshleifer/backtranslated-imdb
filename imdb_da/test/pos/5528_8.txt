I saw six of a kind to W.C. Fields - he's only in it for about 10 minutes and has a long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other amazing moments. Reamaining 55 minutes is also lovely, fortunately, mostly because of the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He's everyone's foil. He stiffens and stumbles to our pleasure. Also his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. Adherence to the case is George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is especially fun near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the picture. Gracie is fun, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I can't remember laughing at him once (though he has a big scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles desperately tries to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields where He asks Fields to sell him a sweater, that bit is only Fields' though). The situation is constant fun: Whindeys will drive to California, but to help them out, George and Gracie are recruited. 8.10.
