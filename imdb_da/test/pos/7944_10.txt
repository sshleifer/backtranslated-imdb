In 1242, Russia was invaded by two sides: from the orientation of the Mongols and from Europe's side of the Teutonic Knights of the Germans in the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The people to organize the defense of Novgorod and the countries of Russia call the Prince Alexander Nevsky, who had defeated the Swedes in an earlier battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans after a huge blow on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 because of the threat of the Germans to Russia during the Second World War. The idea was to make propaganda to Russia. But it is an overwhelming, wonderful, amazingly powerful masterpiece. It is the amazing battle scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very used to special effects, as in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, and may not understand how amazing this black and white battle is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and see it as an art, he will surely be astonished in the end with such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
