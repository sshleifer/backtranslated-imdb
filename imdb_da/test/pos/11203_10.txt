After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-90s few, but the most prescient observers could have anticipated such a recent pique in the Turkish film industry, it built enough on ex-photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan's work. br /> <br /> Uzak is the director's third move and forms something of a trilogy with his two previous images (Kasaba and Clouds of May) following similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer living alone in a small Istanbul apartment, which was only occasionally visited by his brusque, married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, has left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. The younger one joins Mahmoud, while he is fruitlessly looking for work in the city, drinking in cafes and nervously observing young women when he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the film has been translated as "Remove," and the film beautifully illustrates any possible connotation of the word Yusuf's physical distance from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men. Ceylan's film rarely contains increased drama, but instead gives full and rich characters to evolve from within tightly framed static shots. He works as an instructor, producer, writer, film photographer and co-editor and throws friends and family in many of the roles. Such a limited, isolated approach to film making can be expected to lead to films that are difficult to infiltrate and associate with most viewers, making Uzak's undoubted humanity even more impressive. Ceylan, however, is a better film formalist than a playwright, ruling from such former film-masters as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After seeing Uzak I can think of getting better suited to the task.
