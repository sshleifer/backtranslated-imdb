This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read a couple of reviews in advance that called it a good B-class movie and were prepared for the worst. Halfway through it, I suddenly realized that I was completely wrapped in it and enjoyed it a lot. There were some really exciting moments when you were looking forward and nervous about the remote control or any other object in range. Overall, this movie does not deserve the B-class tag. <br /> <br /> Credit to director, Gary Ellis and writers, Bill Boatman and Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys continue with bigger budgets and some study grants.
