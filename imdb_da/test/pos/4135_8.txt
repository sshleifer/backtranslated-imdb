I first saw Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what made me sit in front of the television set for HBO and watch this exciting biopic. What I remember was to realize that it was a (somewhat) true story of a person who actually lived. I remember the music, the good songs I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey was singing his own songs and so good - what a stud!) Then the ending came. He died. He's freaking dead. I could not believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge that most people come into this movie. It taught me a hard lesson about life and how it does not follow the rules that most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and got engaged again and a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit a little bias.
