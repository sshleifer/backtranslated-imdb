Although Cover Girl's plot is very flimsy and tired, it serves as an anchor for Kern and Gershwin musical tracks. After her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to star in this musical that seems tailored to her. Besides looking as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was loaning to Columbia from the MGM, matched her with dancing and the sequence where he made cavorts with his own shadow well done. The supporting characters were also competently listed. Personally, I haven't had Cover Girl as much as the musicians Hayworth made with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. Min score: 7/10.
