Can't rate this very well because I can't say I liked it. But it's the story that bothered me, not the realization of the movie. The action, directing, atmosphere, music was all good. It's just that when you see a bunch of people doing things you can't really relate to, the movie ends. It is educational in the way that it shows war gravel, from home and the way feelings don't have to make sense and still be strong, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> This plot covers a period of a few years when the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and later the child, while ex (Knightley) marries another guy. But the excitement is there, Dylan is a self-smoker and the new man comes home from the war with a small case of PTSD. Add in some rather temperamental signs and you have your hands full. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You need to be "in the mood" to like this movie. The hard part is to define this mood. I don't think I've ever been to it yet. Ever. So it is probably better watched by adults with an understanding of strangely complex human behavior and perhaps a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
