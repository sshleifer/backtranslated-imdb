Nice to see an adult comedy. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin via Mike Nichol's own mastery. Sir. Nichol's masters are presenting characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and raging Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and raging Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in "Closer ". In "Charlie Wilson's War" is the shocking truth beyond the characters, and the sad and raging Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it's only personal to a point. Hanks will limit his luster in single malt and Julia Roberts throws lots and introduces characters with obvious straightforwardness. Amy Adams witnesses and exist as a sign, testimony. An insurmountable task that Miss Adams manages to overcome, beautifully. It is Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t who monopolized my attention. His character may not be a first, but it is a first way that Hoffman presented him to us. Someone who survives the breach he is treated with the absolute conviction that he is smarter than all of them. Hoffman is amazing. The pacing of the narrative does not help to fall into a myriad of useless questions. A sharp, short, smart, sad comedy, and when was the last time I could say it?
