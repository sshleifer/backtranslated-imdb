This is the final feature film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, using Wim Wenders, and adapting from his short story "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 short stories with well-known themes that we have come to expect from his previous works, and summarizes these themes in vignettes weighed together through Wender's directed scenes involving John Malkovich's director character. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth, as we are accustomed to from an Antonioni movie, while Malkovich's story of supposed depths steered with obscure diction that sounded a bit pretentious and out of place. <br /> <Nonetheless, all four stories seem to touch random meetings and extremely fast-paced romances that played more like desire at first glance, perhaps due to lack of time (as they are short stories anyway) to allow for for a more layered approach to carefully define and manage the characters we know from a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach is here for the characters to indulge in showing a lack of deeper connection that is sacrificed to the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Perhaps this is supposed to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre) who meet when you ask the other for directions to a hotel and later meetings in a caf√©. It's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet, but part and face again much later, but as the games people play, it's almost like an L'Avventura or a La Notte with a lack of communication and expectations from the man. John Malkovich's director character plays a key role in the next card showing some really lecherous looks against a girl working in a shop played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and feels uncomfortable, but somehow picked the courage to approach him, and in what I thought to scare him, he tells his background that she was killing her father by stab him 12 times. But in a moment, the two are away from the bedroom gym. <br /> <br /> Next card, Don't Look For Me is the longest of the party, with Peter Weller playing a cheating man to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the more star studded of the party, with Jean Reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it, extending the small universe where this short exists. But unfortunately, Reno's involvement was also referred to some ridiculous push as it enters the relentless domain with laser fast romantic tanglements. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel as well, while the initial story of the story of souls was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme here where this short wish to play, it will be the double of man. In between this short and the next was a small scene that reunited our couple from La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former painted a landscape reminiscent of the Red Desert. Finally, we have the last shot This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez as a young man who goes after a girl (Irene Jacob) whom he just met and fell in love with, only to realize that it is also a love late. It's a relatively talkie piece, like the first story, with the characters talking in conversation while walking in the streets of the city they are in, such as Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> While on the whole, the movie can succeed as individual pieces, they never quite measure up as a combined effort with the "excuse" to connect them with a film director's exploration of possible stories and an inspiration fight for his next movie.
