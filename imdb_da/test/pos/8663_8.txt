A bus kills an nameless man outside of a worn standard oil fire station in the middle of heaven. We never learn where the bus came from or why he is on it or who he is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "cumbersome man" referred to in the movie title? Has he died and been in heaven or hell? Like our husband, we don't get a chance to stop and wonder. He is greeted by a gatekeeper of varieties and transported to an indefinite city. From day 1, all choices are made for him. An apartment has been rented, a job is found, an office assigned. In fact, his life is not quite contrary to life in the virtual reality of corporate cabins and suburban condos. Women are heartless, dinner parties are traits, office jobs suck. But some pieces do not fit the puzzle. Quietly efficient, gray-clad goons roam the streets. Are they some kind of paramedics, or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even in the real world? When we think we might get some answers, new mysteries unfold. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you half relieved that it's over, half want more. I hope they will soon come to a computer game.
