Though this was a movie in just under forty minutes, it is one of the best directed and acted stories I've ever seen. It goes in less than 45 minutes what most movies can't be in over 90. It's the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. They come from a poor farm family in the Mississippi. Both are caught up in war and the conflict between tasks and love for family. It brought tears to his eyes, especially because the whole movie is so well acted and controlled, plus it tells the story of so many wars where one earns and the other back. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this movie as amazingly amazing!
