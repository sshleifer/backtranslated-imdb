Complaint and almost unbearable melancholy of Amalia Rodriques' music goes to a place in the soul that only music can touch. In her voice and magical presence, Fado's exquisite pain is an art form that I didn't know until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautiful and lovingly crafted documentary is the fact that the film maker resists the temptation to editorialize and simply allows us to share in the magnetics and the elegant passion of this icon. There seems to be an inevitable correlation between the Portuguese Fado and the American Blues. <br /> <br /> Documentary films are at best transported to a previously unknown reality. And having got this glimpse, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
