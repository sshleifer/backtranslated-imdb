Let me start by saying overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give it a 7/10. The Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost every role. In this movie he does not play his usual character, the type that is in control, but Geena Davis is in control, and Sam is together for the trip. His timing on his lines is amazing and he is the highlight of the movie. Geena Davis also gives a good preformation like Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible action hero, and I do not think that many other actresses could pull off the performance of Geena Does. 2. The action: This is a very action-packed movie. Things are almost always going down or blowing up, or someone is hunting over another. Special effects are pretty good, especially because they are almost 8 years old. I can see some green screen stuff, but it doesn't detract from the actor too much. <br /> <br /> The bad: 1. Why did it take half of the movie to create the plot? This movie had to be edited in the script scene so it didn't run as long as it did. Maybe a drama or something can run that long, but people really have to be in the movie all the time to maintain it. I think if you can stick out in the first half, you get the other half. 2. Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank top, but she never seems cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a huge sign after he is blown out of a room and then lands in a tree and rises up. When you see this part, you think it's a gag. overall fun movie 7/10
