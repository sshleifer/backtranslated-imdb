I got this as a complete set of 9 episodes of 5 DVDs. I didn't know anything about the history of the series. Season 1 in the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 shows 5 episodes, the latter being Beyond Good and Evil with an original Air Date on December 7, 1998. The other 4 episodes in season 2 was released from December 1997 to febrausry 1998. So besides good and evil, season 3 episode 1 is similar, except that there are no more episodes in season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters in the first 8 episodes, Dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner) is missing from this episode to be replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charley Fielding Eva Pave). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series Inspector Lynley Mysteries, who started in 2001. So they planned to have a season 3, but only one episode was broadcast. It seems strange to try to continue a series named after the protagonist, McCallum, when the protagonist is away from the series. So they could have planned a return by Dr. Iain McCallum, but as it failed, the series was canceled. I have no internal knowledge of this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
