The creative team that brought us the Police Squad - and the naked gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode. Basically, the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be fun, the viewer would actually have to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a couple of minutes while they were having food or going to the toilet etc. The greeting of the greeting is extremely dry (it uses no lattice tracks), and the universe in which the characters are located is one where something can happen, regardless of logic, as long as it was absolutely incredible; So in an episode, a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street to get a heart surgery tip. Those who are familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films. In the films, Nielsen developed a special "take" approach - that is, the eyes are expanded when confronted with the unexpected. This does not happen in the performance, where Nielsen's Drebin is the center that the rest of the universe is about - nothing is unexpected for him. There are also no romances in the show, and no parodies of MTV. Finally, the show takes some risks to avoid the movies; In the first episode, Drebin, to "re-enact the crime", a group of murder detectives have shot each other from a variety of angles - ballistic in the hard way. This is actually a risky bit of humor, as we have to accept that it is quite normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experiments. This kind of thing rarely goes into the movies. Individually, each of the episodes is more fun than any of the naked pistol films, as they are both more compact (more in shorter time frame), but even more leisurely (there is no hurry for a punch line that sometimes happens in the films). There are some discrepancies that occur in the films (primarily "2" and "3") which never occur in shorter time frames. Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first movie) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you look at the episode of the TV series after an event in a meeting, the dry quality of humor can carry away its tolerance. <br /> <br /> However, it would be helpful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - whose laughter has as some claim medical value to see this show is good for one's health .
