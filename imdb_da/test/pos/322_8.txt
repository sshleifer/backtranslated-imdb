Last night I saw a PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). It was strange that it was 137 minutes long - a little longer than the time specified on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I was the first to lose interest in this movie because the pretty confusing movie really lost me. The context of what arose was missing, and I'm glad I'm stuck in it. In the beginning, a young couple are married and shortly after the wedding, the war breaks out into their original Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and aboard a refugee ship heading for India. In a refugee center you see the lady by giving birth - after which the titles of the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The whole focus of the movie is then completely changed - to a young girl who is turning 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems to be interesting or important and you wonder what is missing - what about the lady who was going to give birth? My wife and I discussed this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the baby's lady in the first part of the movie. Somehow, she had been adopted and talked about her life with mother and father # 2 - although she was not aware that these people were not her biological parents. <br /> Shortly afterwards, the parents themselves revealed to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the movie) when they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parents and tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally turned up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way, her parents agreed to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact of all this on the girl and the parents (especially the adoptive mother) was impressive to see and surely derive my interest. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamil militants, occasionally for three decades. The family's decision to look for the mother back in Sri Lanka was actually noble, but also a bit stupid - as they took so many risks and were almost killed again and again by blinding the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating, but also left me asking about the adoptive parents' hygiene - first she says she is not your biological child, and now you take her in the middle of a war zone !!! Sure, the baby really wanted to meet her biological mother, but it was really stupid in backside. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the child - thus avoid being in the midst of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the movie was great to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect, it is probably an emotional hometown. Also, while I was expecting this because I watched several Indian movies, many Westerners will be a little surprised at the live songs that seem to come out of no where - this is standard in most movies from India - including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
