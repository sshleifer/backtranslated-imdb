Some movies just flash away, but Tourist Trap has resisted the time trial and has rightly become a cult favorite. Although not completely original - it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it keeps its own with a humorous sense, real scary moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio and the fun performances of Chuck Connors and cast. Don't let the PG class stay away. This movie shows that no gore and nudity is needed in any horror movie to make it entertaining. These elements are usually used to cover the lack of tension in a movie. Here, the scares are merited and effective. Plus, only Chuck Connors could wear a scene where he has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on widescreen DVD, this movie is a must for fans of 70's horror fare.
