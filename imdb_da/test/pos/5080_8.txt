Imagine you've just been on a plane for 18 hours. You've been on a business trip to South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You've lived in the US for 20 years. You are in your thirties, you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the road. One thing, even if you have a green card, you are still Egyptian. At transit, you are asked to come up with 2 security guards, the next thing you know you are overridden, hooded and chained and after a brief (yet reasonable civil) interrogation you must be done! This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the start of the movie. His is a story of pain and (literally) torture. It is one of several story lines. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucracies behind the rendering. Another story is about the family of the man leading interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are also other stories, and eventually they all come together. Although the more famous actors like Reese Witherspoon (like the confused pregnant wife) Jake Gyllenhaal (as CIA rookie forced to watch interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as CIA hotshot Corine Whitman), it is truly the more unknown actors who carry the story and give it its heart. For me, the actor who played the unlucky Mr El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this movie. His portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. It's almost like he was tortured for real! Also, the Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive as the part worried the family and an extremely cruel torturer. Hard to see and not exactly fun, but still very worth it.
