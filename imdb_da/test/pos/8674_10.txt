I think it's the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It is about 40-year-old Andreas who is hit by a metro station and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, but everything here has been made ready for him. He has a job, a house and clothes. In the beginning, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who clean up and repair everything that does not fit in with their definition of perfect. But Andreas can't really seem to fit in and start to return to his old world and try to get back with all means. <br /> <br /> What impresses me most in this movie is how they make the city seem so surreal, even though I've seen many of these places in reality, they seem so remote. Another thing that contributes a lot to it is the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and troublesome Andreas. And all the other characters also do a good job of playing apathetic (sounds like a hard job, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to very entertaining situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie. The reason can be a little confusing, but the movie has such a good atmosphere, I would recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> And I don't recommend listening to "ccscd212" as it looks like he's seen too many commercial American movies and seems to be getting used to just earning the morale on a silver plate . The way I see it is not much in this movie trying to tell us whether suicide is right or wrong. I consider it a warning about the direction our society seems to take. But of course everyone can watch a movie in their own way.
