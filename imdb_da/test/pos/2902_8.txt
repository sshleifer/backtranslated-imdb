I watched this movie back in 1954 on a double bill with "King's Valley." These films helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Today, "The Egyptian" is suffering from flat dialogue and a few gauche touches, but it is a brilliant movie to watch - that kind of thing Hollywood, unfortunately it just doesn't do anymore - and It has a fantastic story ... not just the usual boy-meeting-girl or revenge-is-my affair. Too bad 20. Will not reissue restored prints of this seen on the Big Screen.
