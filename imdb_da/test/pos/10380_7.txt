NVA combines eastalgia humor, military comedy and teen film. Although it is somehow typically German movie-like sentimental, I think it's a big and very funny movie. You will not only laugh at NVA but also gain some insight into the East German armed forces in the late 1980s and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Republic. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another movie directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you enjoy Good Bye Lenin, who is much more serious and less obviously fun. <br /> <br /> The action is acceptable. But beware of former boy singer Kim Frank, who only has two facial expressions: Natural and shocked saucer-eyed!
