Plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in film, but directly, and is looking for his first big chance. He discovers Molly in a game and immediately knows that she will be a great movie star. He signs her a contract with the provision that he should lead. The manufacturer agrees and their great careers are underway. What follows is a recreation of the silent movies and early sound films with great emphasis on comedy. And oh yes, there is romance and a little sadness too. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is also a real plus with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras also in this restored version released in 2008. It should be emphasized that this movie is a story 1, not just a tribute to silent movies. Later years would bring similar films such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969). What is special about this movie is to recreate silent movies in 1939. We see parts of them as the cinema's audience in the bygone era would (while some sound effects are included) in brilliant b & w while the rest of the movie is inside untouched color. One of the greatest in the quiet era, Buster Keaton, who at this time was on an uphill climb, is used excellently in 2 quiet movies restored scenes and he is at the top of his game! It is said that he also had some input on his scenes. But the real reason to watch the movie, if you are a film story movie, is beyond anything else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's film heritage. It doesn't take a genius to realize that this movie is a "positive" recast of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly is of course Mabel. Sennett had the cake holes, bathrooms and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. Not only all that, but Sennett was the technical advisor for this movie and also appears in it. Since most film actors today prefer sound functions, those associated with short motifs and silents are omitted for pastures. As Mack Sennett fell into that category, it's fortunate that there is the Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was, of course, very instrumental in the development of comedy in movies. His career started in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He was half retired in 1935 with about 500 films for his credit. He had worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). As a movie comedy is an extremely difficult way to pursue an entire career, Mack played it wisely and did only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an academic award in the category of short subjects, and another in 1937 for a lifetime at work. In the 1940s, his presence was still marked, for example. Here came Co-Eds (1945), where a recreation of the oyster soup scene that was used in Macks Wandering Willies (1926) is made. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett's Crosby movies. 2 years later, some nostalgia brought down the movie Down Memory Lane, where he participated. With his ability to always relate to the right people, a guest role came with the ever-popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show later this year. 1950 re-released its greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on television, This is your life, then his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), a great companion to the Hollywood Cavalcade, was released. In 1955, a more concrete connection with Abbott & Costello brought him a como in A&C Meet Keystone Cup. Finally in 1957, another tribute to the compilation movie, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you look at Hollywood Cavalcade, it is the legacy of a pioneer in a movie. In the movie on the banquet stage, the camera throws over the guests at a long table. When we get to the silver-haired Mack, he only turns his head to the camera as if to say "here I am!". As he rises to give a speech shortly afterwards, he is most subdued and suppresses the words that gave him as if to mentally convey: "I know my influence on comedy will never end but people will forget Mack Sennett Perhaps this movie will help. "
