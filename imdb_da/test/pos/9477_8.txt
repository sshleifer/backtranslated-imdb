This is what James Cagney is all about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard like nails and no-nonsense charisma. Although the plot sounds serious, the movie is anything but. It's done in 30-inch screw-basketball comedy style and works well with his "bickering" with fianc√© Mae Clark and his reactions to his colleague James Burke's great stories. <br /> <br /> What raises it usually is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. The dialogue is good, but it is nothing unless delivery is present and can skip the signs involved. This is done well by everyone throughout. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable.
