Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows the city. <br /> <br /> In 2006, the Da Vinci Code broke records, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown's followers, it did not do his award-winning book justice, and even though they ran for just over two and a half hours, it seemed to be many. <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempting to solve the mystery of the Louvre murder, but for angels and demons, the scales were raised again as star and director back. <br /> <br /> After asking, most people prefer angels and demons to the Da Vinci Code for an entertaining reading, and it seems like criticism and fans, but it is still not fully justified to prefer this latest adaptation to the release in 2006. <br /> <br /> This Howard image has definitely a more clinical energy and exercise for it as opposed to Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon h as just one night to solve the Forgotten activities of the Forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and due to the time constraints, action and desperation of ante and delivering a thrill that surely beats the Da Vinci Code, but also generates lots of twists and amazing murder sequences. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor in this release in 2009 is that the constant elements are eligible for the killings. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a sense of superior power to the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the thrill of constant thrills and sharp drama with the problems and beliefs that have been followed up once again. <br /> <br /> Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discovery discoveries that once thought to be lost forever, and Langdon is again the key to showing all the light in and among the controversy of other pressing circumstances . <br /> <br /> It is fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex author; he likes to cope with problems and dramas in his action and exciting sequences. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the choice of a new pope, the negotiations with a new scientific experiment, and the power of religion is again present. Everything interesting to discover and listen to, if debates and dialogues occasionally tend to scold, but as there is so much in the novel, it was always likely. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who honestly held the kind of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst possible way. His jerky, ever-moving camera styling does nothing to keep up the pressure, and we can never quite accept what is happening on the screen thanks to this frankly horribly ornate style. He's definitely no Paul Greengrass, and it's not Bourne at all. <br /> <br /> Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
