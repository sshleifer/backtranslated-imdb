I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dance, music and choreography! Leaders, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had got me jailed with their exquisite dance! They must always keep shining and continue to dance. Their on-stage chemistry was amazing, and the connection between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favorite and probably will always be. Long Live Riverdance!
