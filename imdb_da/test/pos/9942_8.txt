Betty is a driver for the production of a production by Verdi's Macbeth. When a car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty gets pulled into the spotlight. The opening evening is an excellent success, and Betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate privately with her boyfriend. But when the girlfriend leaves the room, Betty is pulled from behind by an unknown black-screened, masked figure. The unknown attacker binds Betty to a column, gags her and places needles under the eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain, Betty should close them. The girlfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and pushes a knife through his lower jaw with such force, the tip of the knife can be clearly seen in the mouth. And Betty has been forced to see all this. Then Betty's scary trial begins with a killer, not just trying to hurt her, but also forcing her to look at while frightening his friends. Opera is classified as a Giallo, but for me it differs in a few ways from the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of history than in something like Argentos Tenebre or The Bird with Crystal Plumage. The black-haired, masked killer can be ubiquitous, but clues and red herring, usually associated with a good Giallo, are absent. Instead, Opera is about the excitement of an unknown killer and makes the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on the pig-sounding scenes, Betty's fear and the murderers' obsession with Betty. Opera features what I think are some of Argento's most artistic death scenes. When the killer digs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty has it. But the sadistic killer will only force Betty to see when he brutally sticks his girlfriend in the neck? The knife appears in the mouth. It's a well shot and designed scene. And they needles in the eyes ?? brilliant. Or take the death of the seamstress. In the beginning, her death looks like an ordinary murder. But when the seamstress accidentally extinguishes the murderer's lock, it began when just another death scene shifts it up, as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's neck open to get its chain. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in Opera, which I am amazed with every time I see it ?? Mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole. This scene shows a lot of what I think about Argento. It has style to burn. Argento was definitely not the first Italian instructor to concentrate on eye relief, but in Opera he has taken eye trauma to pay attention. a new level. Needles that keep the eyes open, a ball in the eye and the ravens throwing in the eye are all part of Argento's vision (the pun). And these scenes have the effect that I think Argento was going to. The first time I saw the killer putting these needles in Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop blinking. It actually had a physical effect on me. What is it about the eyes that make them a target of abuse in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not sound like such a fanboy), there are issues I have with Opera that keeps me from judging it as Argento's best. One of my problems is with the air duct system running through Betty's apartment complex. While I am not in doubt, there are air ducts in older apartment complexes that connect the apartments, the canals of Opera are STORE. I'm not an expert, but I doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such air ducts. It doesn't seem practical at all. And do you think no one would have done anything with them long ago to keep criminal and curious neighbors out of the other apartments? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I suppose my big problem with the movie comes with the final. What happens to the ending? It feels completely out of place, tacked on and a bad thought. I'm not sure what's more to say than it's terrible.
