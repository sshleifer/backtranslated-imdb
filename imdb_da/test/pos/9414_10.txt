I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film its not exactly precise English title) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humor. It lets them either cold and confused - as clearly made several other commentators on this site - or resulting in doubled laughter, unacceptable grin and occasionally ridiculed admiration. <br /> <br /> The team comes from the movie's complete blend of parodies in contemporary style. The goals include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classic scene drama forms, from kabuki to late shakespearian and Spanish renaissance Christian fantasy; naff vacuity of the modern American and European musical, which testifies to a wealth of random tap and rapeseed and some very funny banal texts, all choreographed with loving "amateur" cliché; Japanese anime and samurai live action clichés; portentous Buddhist ritual; and the overwhelming sweetness of Viennese operetta. I haven't laughed so loudly at this type of movie since Ken Russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in "The Boyfriend". The grin comes from the clever textual subversion of the Japanese legend, told in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the play of the 17th century master Chikamatsu. As in his work, the story is advanced in a mix of song, recitative, high-wing poetry and low comedy - here is the source of the incompetent ninja, ostrich, of peasants under the illusion that he is a tanuki raccoon in human cover. All this is somehow connected, and even more remarkably, one can engage the sentinel's feelings through the cosmetologist of cultural references. <br /> <br /> In fact, Princess Raccoon wears his pan-cultural garb with nourishing brightness, and it is astonished here. Visually - again, as with Russell's masterpiece - the movie is a treat, a color capture with its digitized background images of classic Japanese images from monitors and printers, over-the-top costumes and scenes sets, mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and coasts. You will love it or destroy it, but there is no reason to throw chalk to be cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" stands first and foremost as a viciously fun and affectionate blow of our contemporary cultural vacuum in both East and West. Bravo!
