A very good film about anti-Semitism at the end of 2. world War. The scene that really speaks highly of these people's ignorance is the meeting of the church when the priest gives his speech against the "international money dealers and communists". It sounds incredible like the speakers that Adolph Hitler used to force down his people's throats, but none of the participants seem to make this comparison.
