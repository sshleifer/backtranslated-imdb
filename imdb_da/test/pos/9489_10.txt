Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double DVD came out, I was understandably excited. I just want to cut the hunt here and say that if you're a kind of Zeppelin fan, run out and buy it right away! It's absolutely spectacular! It blows 'The Song Remains The Same' completely out of the water. Why this material was never released before is beyond me. The pictures presented here really show Zep at the top of their game, which I never really felt that "singing" did it right. Jimmy Page is the best ever without a doubt, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like a chump! Looking for live jam 'White Summer' ... whew! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
