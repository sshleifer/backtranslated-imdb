This movie is truly unique. It really captures the doctor's spirit, but makes it entertaining for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was credible and erotic, not drawn by many adjustments. It's also fun that I almost cried with laughter. <br /> <br /> Like most Troma, it is in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, but adds some really good plays and a Shakespeare plot. You really have to watch this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are some hillarious jokes in the credits (the best credits I've seen since Hot Shots) lots of Troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare ref. And Lemmy from Motorhead House tells. I borrowed this movie for a friend and had an almost impossible job getting it back. Troma at best, this movie is really a gem and goes into my top 5 favorite movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Though it is not the kind of movie you want to see with your mother and maybe offend some people. For someone bored with the run of the mill's cinema, with a crazy humor, you have to watch this movie.
