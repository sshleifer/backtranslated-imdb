In Hong Kong, 1962, editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife and secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband are also editing an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and suppressed love. Later, they realize that their comrades have an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shame and probably repressed state of married woman keep her love on a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholy and romantic love story with a wonderful photograph and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The movie hadn't had a script, and the actors were never sure what to shoot. Later, the director edited his story based on the footage. When Chow moves to Singapore, for many years there is a gap in history until 1966 when its conclusion is deliberately open and not well-defined, leaving questions like who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cupid Ã€ Flor da Pele' ('Love on the surface of the skin')
