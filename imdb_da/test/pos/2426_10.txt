Let me first say that this movie is not for everyone. It has a very strange subject. A spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse. She notices him sitting in the rain and inviting him to wipe and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. Yet she is fascinated by him and sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and continues his silence, although we later find out that he is not at all dumb and that he reports to his sister everything that happens between him and the woman. I will not give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie watch it. You can't take your eyes off it. What makes it so interesting? Now, it's totally unique. I have never seen anything like this and seeing these two together is very unpleasant. Especially when you find out what this boring, boring, obsessive spider is capable of. You won't forget it soon.
