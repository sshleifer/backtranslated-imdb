I'm out of words to describe the beauty of the "Cranes flying," but I will still try to write about it. It is a strong and delicate love story that takes place in World War II. It is the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them. The film's pictures are so beautiful that you are carried away - the film technique is in perfect harmony with the emotions. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes depicting the direct war: a bombing - wind, lightning explosions - that will have major implications in the protagonist's main activity, Veronika, waiting for Boris to return; and there is another scene on the front where we will be confronted with an emotional / visual hurricane showing the pictures played in Boris's mind. Another scene acts as the movie's leitmotif and gives its title - the cranes fly in the sky. This image stands as the symbol of nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: Not to give up hope and fight for a better future. Kalatozov is a great instructor, this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply. It's not just pure technology. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What more can I say? The film exceeds the time it was made - the action takes place during World War II. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. As long as there are wars (big or small), the movie will remain relevant.
