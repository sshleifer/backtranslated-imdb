This was one of the movies I would always come across (whether on TV or cheap DVD), but never hit me to give it a shot when I thought I didn't miss much. It was on one night and I thought it was good ?? why not. A good decision too, as I would kick myself to take so long to get around to it. For me, it left me impressed, as it is up there with Burt Reynold's best features ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') and is returning to the 70s / 80s gritty, hardboiled urban crime thrillers that were not scared Being forebodingly obscure and going out of their way to set up characters, pack it with realistic brutal power and effectively incorporate the local places (Atlanta is the case here) to the fold of grounded photography. In some nuances it reminded me of 'Dirty Harry', but it is resolved. But it's saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks, funky shifts and unhinged sounds, much had me thinking of Lalo Schifrins vibrant score he orchestrated to 'Dirty Harry'. The music's soundtrack, on the other hand, is hit or miss. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was a narcotic drug in the Atlantic before a slip-out under a bust saw him demoted to vice work. Along with his new squad, they come across a prostitution ring that captures their interest because it is owned by a hard-to-track and judge's criminal. What they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call girl who can give them some important names, but they must come to her before she has made a goal. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynold's actions also lead into an unconscious solid and muscular way that would suit his laconically-crafted performance and Gerald Di Pego's thematically bitter and tight manuscript (adapted to William Williams novel). Well, he shows a kind of heart / insightful thought among the armor within the scenes involving subsequent British actor Rachel Ward, whether it is played scenes when he sees her from another building (and slowly becomes a traitor of her) to when They eventually coincide, but these latter interactions through the midst of slowing the momentum, but giving it noir as a stroke. The show is pretty good with Reynolds making a huge report with exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The mocking fate and witty dialogues between these guys was a ghost. With regard to the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds impressive strength and power, but it is Henry Silva (who seems to be born for these roles), beautifully cunning and unstoppable, making the show. Where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place. Plus, his adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climax with Sharky and his team is superbly done. <br /> <br /> The thrilling action channels can be fast and dry, but remain easily violent as a tremendous thought grinding sequence. Some handy old-fashioned movie techniques add excitement. The exciting material keeps it quite tactical to be character-derived, but when we think of the smooth sailing, it gives a blurred surprise or two along with some intense brown confrontations.
