I watched the movie and am very happy to see a movie so different in character and history to the stupid, mainstream American major productions. It is a film with a background that is interesting for young people as much as all age groups. Unlike some reviews, the audience seems to share my judgment, as the film is very successful where it is still being used worldwide. For example, in the Netherlands ranked number 3. Negative statements must be respected, but one should expect to be guided on a factual basis. If you have the chance, watch the movie and enjoy it.
