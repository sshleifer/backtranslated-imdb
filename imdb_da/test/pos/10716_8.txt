Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer follows an insidious businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and their baby in search of a better life, forcing Ted to get closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two tapes become very dense (but only after a little friction), and just as everything goes perfectly, Ted's wife comes back to town and wants to have sole custody of their son. Ted then goes on mission not to let his son be taken away from him and fight his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a great performance with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspirational movie. The film took the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you don't mind a tearjerker, Kramer vs Kramer is a great movie to watch. Grade: B +
