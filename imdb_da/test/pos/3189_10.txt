Love In Limbo is my all-time favoirite movie. (put in W.A) It is hilairious and has an excellent cast, including a group of three beautiful actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), back on the day when he actually saw HOT with short hair and not facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet), and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a senior high school student who is obsessed with sex and is shown to sell pornographic drawings to his classmates. He is starting a new job with his uncles clothing factory and joining forces with another new guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up chickens. They become friends with good-twoshoe's geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe), and the three guys drive up to Kalgoorlie to turn a brothel and lose their virgin ...... <br /> <br /> See what it is a classic !! For so long I have tried to get a DVD or Soundtrack, someone tells me if you have em.
