It was amazing. As a librarian and a participant in the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund Event on Thursday evening, October 18, I was privileged to see a pre-release screening of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed due to concerns about the welfare of the children involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event could continue as planned. <br /> <br /> As for the film, I feel it was masterfully done. It had so much influence on me, as I think Stanley Kubrik is a Clockwork Orange, although it is much less graphic - much less. There is no comparison between the horrible, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; Only the subject and the consequences for the human psyche are comparable. (I've written more details about the violence and rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was amazing; one of the best made movies I've seen. The depiction of the Afghan boys flying their dragons captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is intensely serious, and the film carries the audience's feelings into the subject without many "Hollywood touches" that have destroyed other movies. Although the turned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism (for me). Finally, I must mention the excellent soundtrack. The review of Rumi's poetry as two protagonists flies the country during the Russian invasion - under scary circumstances - really showed the power of these poems. I urge anyone to disregard the subtitles of that scene to the extent you can and just listen to the beauty of language. I don't even know what language Amir quotes if his normal Danish dialect is the same as Rumi's original Persian dialect. Also pay attention to the sound that is heard every time a dragon line is cut. I found it a deep, clear sound, even though the librarians who were with me did not see it at all. I can't wonder if dragons actually make a sound when they are "scored" or if it gives a feeling of the vibration / sound that kite flyer experiences during the competition.
