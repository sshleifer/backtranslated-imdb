I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens. It begins with a scene where Doug talks to Carrie on the phone and suggests that they agree to stop completing each conversation with "I Love You." But it's hard to do, and he ends up calling her back only to close with "I love you." It's a very smart moment, and one I think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time. I think (but I'm sure) it's the same episode where Doug gets some local construction guys whistling and throwing lurid comments on Carrie to spoil her spirits. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repetition. Don't know which network I was looking at. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
