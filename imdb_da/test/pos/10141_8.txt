Certainly, this film has the truth about what it claims to be based on actual events on a naval base. It is about the attempt to cover the local naval commander for unacceptable behavior of a marine mother, which resulted in him being shot to death by his former girlfriends, a marine captain. The man and the woman had been lovers, but the captain tried to interrupt the relationship when she discovered her boy's friend was married. He continued to steal her and went so far as to shoot his side arm in one direction at a time. Finally, he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service gun and killed. The civil prosecutor raised the killing self-defense, but the marinists decided to murder the captain. The big ones you see were decorated entirely from Vietnam, and an old friend to the commander Colonel on the Marine base. The captain had also made some enemies in his motor bass command and rejected some male advances in a very agile style. There is considerable psychological freight motivation and governs the actions of the most important participants in this drama, as the highly skilled casting comes across nicely. However, the director and editor seem to be determined to cover the events as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and changing views. You are lucky if you know where you are most of the time. Carry with them; It's a worthy story when the captain's court campaigns unfold, and it seems that every man's hand is against her, even her lawyer at times. <br /> <br /> Judgment? Well, it's a thrill story, so you'll have to see for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message folded into the movie, but forget it. Sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. We need these Marines, although they are not always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": "Tommy this and Tommy are, and Tommy is waiting outside. But there is room for Mr. Atkins when troopship is on the tide."
