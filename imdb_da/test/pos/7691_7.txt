I first saw the opening of Otto Premingser's "Porgy and Bess" on television, probably sometime in the early 80s, and my younger self found it a little slow despite the timeless music. I knocked it off. <br /> <br /> Last night, an extremely rare, cobbled together print was screened at L.A. Cinematheque, and it was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a lot of vulnerability, strength and subtle (at least in today's standards) eroticism to her side. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie, but his performance is amazing as it is Pearl Bailey. Even better is Sammy Davis as the amorous, cat-like Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the wild Bully Crown. <br /> <br /> I'm still not a fan of Preminger's earlier, the lead - and much easier to see - "Carmen Jones." Porgy and Bess "are far better than the less controversial movie - although this may be due to the fact that the source material is also much better. <br /> <br /> As seen last night, this is a robust but far from perfect work Not all moments are quite alive, and there is something awkward in the way that the film blends the blatantly stylized Catfish Row set (beautifully done by Oliver Smith) with actual locations, also for my rather untrained ear, some short parts of the score seems unfairly popular. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this does not cause the filmmakers to achieve - Preming's decision to shoot almost exclusively in large images without close-ups and occasional interim images, undoubtedly made it unattended on television "scanned and scanned" and can kill it even on widescreen DVDs if it gets the recovery it deserves. On smaller screens we can't explain the many details essential to how Preminger staged the movie. <br /> <br /> Also my xh heard last night was strange. Many of the vowels, especially on the "Summertime" opening, seemed terribly soft and overwhelmed by the instrument music. Perhaps this can be solved in a restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the issue of the movie's race policy. Personally, I see nothing wrong with it, at least in a modern context. At the time when so few films portrayed strong African American characters, this may have been an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And although there may not be much "authorization" here, these are recognizable people who are not racial stereotypes. These are operational signs that make bad choices because that is what tragic characters do. That alone made it a huge step forward in time. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic African-American characters are less rare (but still not common enough), these characters seem no more or less than human. They could really be poor and underdue people of any ethnic background. <br /> <br /> Thorny politics aside, the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American music and (secondary) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and yes Pearl Bailey were all great performing artists that we will never see again. This less than perfect but still solid movie deserves to be seen and worth.
