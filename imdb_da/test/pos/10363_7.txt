I actually flew to the life channel by mistake, just as this movie began and ended up seeing it. <br /> <br /> It certainly addresses a serious problem, probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack by a young woman by an ego-maniacal fellow student who feels that he is over the system and unfortunately it is Often. <br /> <br /> Casting here was credible and the performance credible. Many of these Canadian / lifetime flicks are definitely "over-the-top". But this is one that I can feel as "under-the-top". <br /> <br /> While appreciating the fact that it was not presented in an overblown way, this movie somehow seemed like a record that is playing at a slower rate than correctly, the 96 minutes seemed like many more, and it seemed like a shorter movie, released over and over, apparently going on and on and back and on - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion. <br /> <br /> But the many characters and performances made it better than the average movie of this type, despite this criticism. And although these images often "milk" the climax, so you could have given it a little more detail and length.
