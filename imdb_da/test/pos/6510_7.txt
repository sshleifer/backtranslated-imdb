Okay, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And also the special effects. But remember, this wasn't a big budget movie, okay? Not all movies get as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> But I thought it was quite fun. B-? Nothing that, in my opinion, will waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie if it was weak on some points. Hope this comment helps. ~ Angela
