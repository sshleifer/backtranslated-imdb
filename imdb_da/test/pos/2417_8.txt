This is the fourth movie in the Karate Kid series. however it has nothing to do with the previous 3. the only sign left is my myagi.this time around Mr myagi meets restless teen julie pierce (hliary swank before she was famous) julie has all sorts of problems including being bullied in school of a guy belonging to a pseudo military club on campus. Naturally, she is trained to fight. Still, Julie teaches karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns to respect herself and eventually regains her respect. I think the unique idea of ​​the antagonist is a woman and has a man as his enemy. There are also some battle scenes that are done quite well, very low key and minimal violence. the battles are graphic. The end is also good and a little surprising. It is predictable, but not a typical end to this kind of movie. The film, of course, has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned. It is not as good as the 1st mov that is, and certainly not as good as the 2nd it is, however, a great leap forward compared to the underlying 3. entry.this is a very entertaining underneath dog movie that fits the whole family. 8.10
