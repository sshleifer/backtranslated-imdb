Now I have seen many many B-grade movies in my 15 years of life, and I have to say that this was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the property and the story, but it suffered from the amateur effect (although Adrienne Barbeau gave a decent performance like Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not keep his portion good enough to be considered good. The second performance that really fits the movie was Barry Hopes (Barney Resnick). It starts with an avid real estate agent who takes an Asian couple through a house, only to find that there is a dead girl in the showhouse shower. It progresses with detective speculation and introduces key people with reasonable grace. I think that for any person who is in the mood for giggling on the over-the-top drama that the victim's real estate agent gives over the top gory scenes, this is really a gem ... XD Who do I do fun? It's not that big but worth seeing if you're boring boring.
