'Thursday' is a good movie, but we recognize too much from other films in his genre and therefore lack originality. If you've seen 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and a bunch of other movies inspired by the last, you've seen almost every part from 'Thursday'. There is a scene that involves torture that even has the same dialogue as in Tarantino's reservoir dogs. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Because not all parts are taken from the same movie, the complete thing has some new ideas and some great details. The opening sequence at first is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They come into a fight with a clerk at a gas station over a cup of coffee, and it ends up with the clerk of death and the arrival of a policeman. We have already glimpsed a suitcase with a lot of money in it. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but used to work with Nick. She doesn't know anything. Then Nick gives him a call and says he is coming. We learn that he has turned his friends over and the problems are starting. <br /> <br /> What happens is not for me to reveal, but we meet with some other characters, anyone interested in money or drugs Nick also had with him. Casey has washed them down the drain. Very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very fun subplot with actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (though you really think about it, you see them) This is a great movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by Skip Woods.
