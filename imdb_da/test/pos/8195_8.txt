This is an excellent movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but then it doesn't try to be. In fact, "the emperor and the murder" probably (more fortunately) more in common with a Shakespeare production than a Hollywood blockbuster. In the 3rd century BC Qin's king tries to unite (in other words, "conquer") the seven kingdoms in China. He has already overthrown the kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> That's where Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are, of course, very in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they design a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the king and flee to Yan. Once here she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin back to kill the king. When the murder fails, the king will have his excuse to invade Yan. <br /> <br /> But in Yan Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Listen and see more and more examples of her old-fashioned friendship's recklessness, she begins to wonder that the king must be murdered for real. <br /> <br /> A sure sign that you don't see a Hollywood production is The Final King-Assassin Meeting. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined, and the final result already predetermined, it is a battle that can really go either. <br /> <br /> This is a well-developed and well-traded story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible uglyness. Most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. I am increasingly convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. However, I must say that she has an unintentional fun line in this movie. Early on, Gong Li asks one of her servants "Do I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
