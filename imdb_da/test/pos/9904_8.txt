Checking Out (2004) brought crowds of film lovers to Scottsdale's Harkin's Cine-capri. Festival attendees, who waited for hours, were turned away at the door, despite the television theater screening capability. Checking Out (2004) is a beautifully made moving image; an inspiring comedy for a wide range of audiences to enjoy. Director Jeff Hare mixes traditional film technology with a new creativity intersection and captures Peter Falk at his biggest and most sentimental moments (usually shown in close-ups) on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> With its uplifting mix of witty humor and plot of plot development, Checking Out (2004) is an independent movie that is well-liked and deserves your attention.
