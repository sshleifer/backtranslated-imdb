OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Deal with it. To see the biography, see it. This is an original, fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about this as they make all other deviations from the facts. Sad, but true. I think Kane Hodder was the man who named the movie a good idea. I thought it wasn't so good at first, I want to be honest. But it made it just scary. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think it's a good movie. But if you are obsessed (like some other people), stay away from this movie and everyone else.
