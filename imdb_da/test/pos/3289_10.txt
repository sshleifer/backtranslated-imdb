I watched Chomps during the approximately 2 days of his theatrical release. It's a nice and fun movie in the 'Benji' spirit, but much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by bullies and villains who get their only deserts, is both sympathetic and cordial. It is also thought provocative. With deep subtlety, this film affects them attention to cruelty, personal behavior and bullying. Movies have different genera and different purposes. This film, which is lovely for all ages, offers an interesting humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone will recognize personality and behavior types by themselves and others. Everyone wants to see humor. The mood makes the movement comfortable and brings the understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> Chomps are a great choice for light-haired laughter and a 'good movie'. Memorable.
