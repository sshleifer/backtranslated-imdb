Back in 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror music video with the "American Werewolf" team and with Vincent Price's voice, that was exactly what he wanted to do. And never have a music video created such a feeling sooner or later ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute card became the world's largest selling musical all the time. But odds are you already know about it, as when there is a list of the best music videos from time to time, it almost always takes the top. <br /> <br /> It begins with Michael Jackson going down the dark street with his date after their car has gone down. He explains to her that he is "not like other men" (wrong right), and then the full moon comes out of the clouds. His girlfriend stands there screaming and screaming and screaming a little more during a lavish transformation sequence that Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the woods, catches her and we ... cut into a movie theater. Oh, all this happens just in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date see. <br /> <br /> Then we are five minutes in and still no sign of the song "Thriller". Extravagant, much? Anyway, you need to know how it goes from here ... dancing, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... end credit. Finish credits for a friggin 'music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackson's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards, it is certainly a bitch of a visual experience. If you still haven't seen it in its entirety then you definitely need one day soon.
