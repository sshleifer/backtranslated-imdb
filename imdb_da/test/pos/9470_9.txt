She is The Man was everything I wanted to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teenage type "chick flick" movie and I knew this would be awesome !! In the same vein as 10 things I hate about you (one of my faves) She's The Man is a unique, well-written, very well-executed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But she's The Man is actually a more intellectual fun, and most of the humor relies on the witty script, "Three's Company" style story about wrong identities and mixed messages and cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even since the days of the terrible campers (still strangely entertaining "The Amanda Show", she has shown an excellent talent for comedies. She is probably one of the most talented comedians out there. Her style of physical comedy, imitation and witty dialect makes her Previously, her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well-made "What a Girl Want." If it wasn't her outbreak than she's The Man, take care of her hands. The ultimate girl next door. It is a shame that she does not do big screen work because she could be the next "It" girl. She is All American, sweet, down to earth, ridiculous teenage (although she is twenty now ) and whether she will be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain seen, but for the purpose of this movie she is perfect !! She actually pulls out of the rather incredible plot of her publishes his twin brother and make it credible. Not quite ... but credible enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her mistakes, trying to be a guy, but it's just fun, not stop laughing. Channing Tatum releases himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's "Havoc" by player Duke. He is the jocke, the football team captain, and finally Bynes' object of love, unfortunately he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes.) He is a good leader and chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (which again is Bynes.) She also does well, even though her part is small, and she does not affect the rest of the cast in one way or another. James Kirk is great in his little role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... they are absolutely credible as twins and more, from a distance you could understand someone who believes Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fits all into one place, and their roles range from brief to more support, but in essence they all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but all are more or less entertaining the villages' amazing performances. She easily wears the film without hesitation and makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that show so much in the trailer and yet it is not one of those films that when that part comes up, it's no fun anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more fun in the current movie. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this movie. He weaves together a potentially complicated story and makes it flowing naturally and makes everything fall together. The story, which is loosely based on Shakespeare's twelfth night, but it is remarkable how much they managed to translate into this modern movie. It seems to be completely away from the wall, but more precisely to the classic comedy than you would think. There is not too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour pulls a little and also becomes a possible predictable one, but it does not change the hilarity of the first half of the movie. Nevertheless, you will laugh at tears and this is one of the funniest movies in the theater right now down !!! 9.10
