The show is great. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Amazing dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they weren't * the * bad *, but because the show really is * the * good *. The editors are compulsive cutters, you cannot see a scene without cutting for more than 15 seconds. It's okay to show different angles, but the guys worked for the first time with multiple cameras in their lives, and they remind you how many cameras they have every five seconds on average ... They are able to film the start of a jump with a camera, then cut it in the middle and show the rest of it at a different angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how much they tried, they couldn't ruin that wonderful show. It is a must for dancing and music lovers.
