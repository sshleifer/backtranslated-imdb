I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was fun. Things with this movie are that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is a smart popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well together. Shatner is a standout in the supportive cast as himself, a former television politician, introduced by Russia's character to train the police on how to be "the TV police". It is by far the funniest scenes. If you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh, watch this movie.
