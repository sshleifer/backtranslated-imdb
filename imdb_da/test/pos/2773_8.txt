My kids loved this movie. we saw it every chance we got. It was fun a fun movie. we saw it as a family and all of us enjoyed it. It was a movie you could see without unpleasant spots that you should explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to see it again. Even after all these years, they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very sweet girl. all my boys had crushed her. they loved her as the pink power ranger why we saw this movie to begin with. (as you can say, I wander a bit to fill LOL lines). But seriously it is a fun movie and worth seeing. Disney please give us a DVD or replay!
