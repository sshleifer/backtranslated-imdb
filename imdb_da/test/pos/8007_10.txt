And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season as winter / Xmas atmosphere as Burton creates for Gotham City is very cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release this as a summer movie. That's not true. <br /> <br /> But what's even more breathtaking when considering the content of this movie is that it was aimed at families. An overclass family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dress up in leather like a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dress up in leather like a cat and a freak running for political office. And S&M and bondage are presented in a very perverted manner. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this movie is the best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only real live action incarnations of the cartoon character. It was true that the animated series was closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and the non-named after that, Batman Returns is the best of the four. Darker and more violent than the first movies when Gothic Pathos feel a new high. I was very keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (not even getting started at George Clooney!), He showed the right balance of Weirdo Loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realistic' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes were disturbing to see. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek it's no other than a very young leather / butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is even better than it was the first round. His powerful and engaging themes are far superior to the dross that followed in the later 2 Schumacher films. This movie is the Batman phenomenon on its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after that. Let's hope Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some integrity back to live-action Batman with their movie next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago! !!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. Pick it up cheaply as I did and hope for a SE in the future.
