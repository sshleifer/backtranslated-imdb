Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half-human, half-vampire known daywalker. He has all his strengths, and his only weakness is the thirst of blood. Since joining whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived among us unnoticed for centuries, but almighty overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to awaken the blood god and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is well cast, written and directed; that the viewer has an exciting ride from start to finish. Leaves are packed with great fighting sequences and smooth dialogue, and it is definitely more action than horror, but it definitely delivers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
