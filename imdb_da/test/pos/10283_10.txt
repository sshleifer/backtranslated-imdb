L'Appartement is, I think, a very targeted Hitchcockian movie. The plot was abundant with symbolism (ie, the white and red roses) and plot twists wrapped nicely. The look was very Parisian and drew you closer to the story. I saw it in London and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
