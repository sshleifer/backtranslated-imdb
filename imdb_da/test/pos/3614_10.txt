A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the ferocity and cruelty of wars, whatever the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz was quite impressive, but it is the older Greek figures that go tallest roses. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes seem a little long at times, this movie will be a heavy Oscar competitor.
