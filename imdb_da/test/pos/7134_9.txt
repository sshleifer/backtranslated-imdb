I'm certainly not a gamer, but a few people in my family and my girlfriend are. So I decided a little reluctantly to find out what the big deal was with "fantasy stuff". I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIUS! It's slapstick, but not disrespectful for those who enjoy role playing games. Also, and most importantly, people who have never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel abandoned or lost to try to understand the plot. The action was great and field shots / sets were trustworthy. This makes me see other movies from this production company. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three toast - well done !!
