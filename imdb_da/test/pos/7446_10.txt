Square really landed this. They did not try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, will they be happy fans when they watch this movie! The story may not be as interesting or trustworthy, but it ties in well with the story of the game and has more honest to happy fun moments !! A total surprise there and a welcome too <br /> <br /> There are lots of cameos and fun references to the game as well. And most importantly, the scenes of the battle rock so hard they can cut through the diamond! They are really the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it, though everything else sucked. I think they are some of the best ever created PERIODS. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Goodbye. <br /> <br /> PS: I know my review sounds like a teen's ravages. It was just like what I was thinking.
