"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it only when I was 10 years old and after school I rushed home and hit Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I LOVED it !! It's such a fun and cool show. It is created by Klasky-Csupo, which is great creators of cartoons. They animated some of my favorite shows ever, such as "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". <br /> <br /> I've seen lots of episodes of this show and I think they're all really fun and sweet. The voters did a good job, which also represented the characters. <br /> <br /> I want Comedy Central to bring this show back together with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But this is a good Comedy Central show. Good work, Klasky-Csupo!
