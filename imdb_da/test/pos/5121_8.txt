This movie was not a fantastic movie theater, but definitely a good movie to watch with your family, especially children from 10-15. There are good topics of discussion raised in this movie, such as mobster, the environment, and work to do things right. Jimmy Buffet music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful ... The young actors were great and it's a movie I expect to watch on the Family Channel or Hallmark Channel. With the exception of a few words in the dialog, an intermediate stage may display this movie to start classroom discussions. Hopefully this will be shown in Drive-ins this summer, so more people will see it. It followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a como performance.
