After watching The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two-pack of The Fox in Hound, I decided to buy it as both films were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> Aristocats are a classic, for sure. It may not be a five star classic, but it is a fun movie and makes a good evening's entertainment. It's a bit of a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The aristocrats are trying to be a merciless musical comedy, and I think it almost works. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't really matter, and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it's certainly not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a bit clumsy in places typical of Disney's 70s movie, but it has a rustic old-world charm about it. Aristocat's strongest points are the characters, the music and the humor. The music is very memorable - try to get 'Everyone wants to be a cat' out of your head in a hurry! The songs are written by Sherman Brothers, who also made The Jungle Book music. There was a song called 'She Never Field Alone' that was supposed to be in the movie, but unfortunately it didn't make it to the final function. It's a shame because I think it would have looked good. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is pronounced by Phil Harris and is basically Baloo in a cat shape. Eva Gabor gives the Duchess this warm and material feeling, and the kitten's voices actually sound like children and not an actor that mimics a child's voice. Secondary signs are here by the dozen and yet you stop understanding their personalities. Edgar, the "villainous" butler plays a similar role to Cruella De Vil, but he is more comical than frightening, often ending in fun situations. Although he is the bad guy, he is still lovable the same. <br /> <br /> The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really made me blow up with their crazy uncle. I also like the dogs who tend to argue over who is the 'leader'. I could go on, but I won't spoil it. But I can tell you, The Aristocats are fun and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humor. Bottom Line - Aristocats may not be Disney's performance or even their strongest 70's movie (the award is a tie between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it's an enjoyable body and is sure to entertain. If you're looking for a dazzling work of art, you might be better off seeing Bambi. But if you want a fun night in, Aristocats is the right way. It's a charming and gracious movie, and it's impossible to dislike it. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats are not seen as bad guys).
