If you are familiar with the work of author Johnny To and his band of film recordings in the Milky Way, you know what to expect with this latest production. All the well-known elements are in place: The strong friendship between two characters: Usually a policeman and a villain, the coincidences and chances that light a crown and pay off well in the end and the humor that arises even in the most gloomy situations. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to steal an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films such as "Longest Nite", "A Hero Never Dies" and "Where A Good Man Goes") portray a hostage dealer / policeman who is on the robber's tail even though the robber is setting up a series of tricks and tracks he must follow to get his husband. <br /> <br /> Funny, cool and cool while weird, "Running" is actually one of the most entertaining Milky Way movies to date. Don't miss out on the performances of the two leaders, esp. Andy Lau is usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to see. This movie is one to go out of your way to see.
