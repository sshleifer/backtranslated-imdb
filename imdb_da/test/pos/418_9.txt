This is NOT your interpretation of the mill police, where the characters were only secondary to the gunfights and the car race. The episodes so far are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something with a lot of straight-kicking Rambo style cop history, you can't find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 9. I want this series to live long. Morse is excellent!
