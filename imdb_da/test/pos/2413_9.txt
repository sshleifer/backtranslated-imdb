For once, a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing orphans Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi, worked with Julie quite differently from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there will also be some humor in this movie. I liked the part where Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to look at her and saw her change clothes in the process. It was very funny! And the classic "Wax on, Wax off" scene was also different. It was fun when Miyagi tells Julie, "Uh-oh, missed place". The set in Boston was far from California. The militant group in this group was like "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Michael Ironside's colleague Dugan was no John Kreese. His group almost left him when Julie kicked a serious ass. They all paid the price when they broke the classic Oldsmoblie. What a wrong act. At least, they find Dugan's poison redemption. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, that talked about "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is excellent in any movie and anything else she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
