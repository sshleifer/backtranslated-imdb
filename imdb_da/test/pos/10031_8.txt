Be Warner Brothers' second historic drama of civil war and the battle of the little horn, General George Armstrong Custer they did with their shoes (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the far more precise of the two; especially in contrast to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really did not set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> Both images were the main role of Errol Flynn, who was a change in the cast that part of general custer While it was "Dutch", even Ronald Reagan portrays the flamboyant egoic Cavalryman in the previous picture, with Flynn playing Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, JEB (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took the Custer party for them with their shoes. ON again, Warner Brothers' propensity to use a large number of trusted character actors from "Warner's Repertory Company" dealing with the film is a kind of authenticity, and everything really happens just before our very own eyes. Major roles have been taken by some better-known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californie" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Little), Callie (Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just shock full of unknown but skilled players like: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe American, himself ), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many many. <br /> <br /> The movie moves very fast, especially in the early moves; then it lowers necessity, as history moves on to post-civil war years, Custer's colonel transfer in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate fate of Little Big Horn in Montana. Under the direction of Director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the movie hits a very varied selection of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; Looks like they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. As with most of Mr. Walsh's film, he draws and accelerates the end of many a scene with a little humor; But don't go overboard and thus risk the chance of making the movie a comedy (farce, actually). As mentioned earlier, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (the last time I want to mention it, honestly Schultz, Scout's Honor!). But that is not to say that it was not without a few small pieces of "artistic and literary license" and it is actually just as little as Biopic wants. It would be impossible to make a similar type of film if in fact all the facts and the event were to be attempted to be included in the manuscript. Perhaps the most erroneous involvement as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that the company that Custer has been randomly promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. It has just not happened, but "gag" helped the movie move together, emphasizing the whole light, the carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated on giving us what seems to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life-man. And they did it on an incident that was the massacre of Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Fukowi of Custer and his 7th Cavalry on the Little Horn. At the time of its event, June 25, 1876, "Custer's Last Stand" was as big an event and shock to the American national psyche as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities committed by Islamic Fascists of the New York Twin Trade Towers and US Armed Forces in the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, September 11, 2002. Just as many films in the period of World War II (and the years immediately before), there were so many events in what If not deliberately done, demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in the time of another global conflict that we were in at the time of their death with your ships were finished with their original theater release period. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
