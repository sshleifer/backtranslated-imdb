There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck card, which is basically when Daffy rides Black Beauty, it's a black woman. I can partially understand why this joke was included as at that time few people knew how rude it was to be racist and it was not even illegal to discriminate against black people yet. <br /> <br /> Apart from this point, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun, interesting card where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I liked this short quite a lot (despite the other reviewers here). The way Daffy is so in love with the movement of the clockwork is vaguely disturbing, yet very entertaining at the same time. Porky is a nice edition for the episode, although it was not essential for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days also bloodthirsty, horrible animals, which of course they have never really been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style of the animation used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally in Daffy Duck and for people who don't mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons, you can enjoy "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
