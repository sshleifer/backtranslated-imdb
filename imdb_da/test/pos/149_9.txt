Chan-wook Park, give it to the guy. In my view, he is not only a brilliant director, but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often give something refreshing, yet satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire story, but one that plays fast and loose with some of the "rules" of the subgenes. Kang-ho Song plays Far Sang Hyeon, a man who unselfishly entrusts to a research program and then selfless kinds of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and returns. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with. Being the only one out of five to survive, he becomes quite famous for those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal. Normal, however, now means being able to skip large distances without harm, who want to drink blood and become very hot under the collar when sun rays come on his skin. It is not long before he lives with a rather dysfunctional family unit that knew him in his childhood, and while hiding his new strange lifestyle, he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle and becomes more acceptable by darker thoughts and slips into a smooth slope could lead him from man to cultivate for monster. Deffly mixed a number of genres, Park's movies felt much fresher and more original than letting the right one in (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with its approach to material that could easily have felt so well worn and rehashed as any other vampire movie we have seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, while also considering ideas such as the strength of faith, power over life and death, the downward movement of immortality, etc. Some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie, but I personally found it was a lively, entertaining and always fun movie that was helped by a great central performance from Song as the tortured priest and amazing twists from a supportive caste without weak links. Many characters will move through a variety of emotions, and all do it with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-wine Kim), who becomes the subject of the priest's love, desire and love. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian cinema (and especially Park) and also fans of Poe's "The Tell-Heart" (see and learn) should unleash this, it's another classic movie from a man who thinks Taking everything in his steps and always doing something less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
