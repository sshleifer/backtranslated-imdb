In 1965, producer Kevin McLory, who owns part of Bond Cinematical Rights Associate with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) to make Thunderball, owns the fourth film in the 007 franchise. The star of course is Sean Connery. In 1982, McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an "independent" Bond movie. "Never say again" (NSNA) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 movies made outside EON (the second is the 1967 comedy spoof "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and stars the original Bond, Sean Connery - who returns to the role after many years of absence. The movie is released some months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At that time, it is called "Farmer's War" ... Both films are a great success in 1983, although "Octopussy" makes more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxurious movie made by excellent technicians - director Irvin Kershner, who led "Empire Strikes Back", Douglas Slocombe Cinematographer of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - and writer Lorenzo Semple Jr - there wrote "Condors three days" - among other things ... The cast is excellent with Connery, a then unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... Although everything the film stays worse than the original " Thunderball ". It lacks many basic ingredients to be a true Bond movie: There is no traditional pistol sequence that is not the James Bond theme, M and Q are not played by the traditional actors. It is a copyright statement: EON is only allowed to use these elements. In short, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere. On the other hand, the film is exciting and fun. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and beautiful. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He is once again wonderful in the role he is older, but looks fitter and nicer here than in "Diamonds are forever", his last performance in the British superspy's role before NSNA.
