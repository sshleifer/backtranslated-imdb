It doesn't surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B / W movie made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union in the short period called "ottpel" or "thawing" has got so much love and admiration among the movies lovers all over the world. It's weird and beautifully busy. Some scenes feel that far ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the textbooks and broadly imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war, but forever alive in memory of a young woman. It is also the film of loyalty, reminds, the ability to live on when it seems that there is nothing to live for; It is about forgiveness and hope. The film received (deservedly) the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as the recipient of a special award in Cannes to play Veronika, the young girl who was fortunately in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of film. After separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the boom trip, and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself, she died inside . Her long journey to redeem, to finally accept her beloved and to learn to live with it, is a fascinating and heartbreaking, and it simply will not leave any viewer indifferent. For me, the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy at the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares and bridges across the Moscow River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one family member to a fight or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to starvation, litter and diseases during World War II, and my family is not an exception. My mother and grandmother knew the war graves and never cured pain at loss not just from movies and books. "Cranes flying" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply. It's a masterpiece of film making, but it's part of my life - my background, my memory and my past.
