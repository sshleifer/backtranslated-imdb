There are so many '10 Best 'lists that could easily fit into "The Dead" - Best Screen Color, Best Literary Customization, Best Use of Music, Not Specially Written for Movies, Best Use of Poetry, Best Screen Speech, Best Ensemble Cast And finally, maybe best movies ever made. This was John Houston's latest and greatest film, adapted by his son Tony from James Joyce's short story, and set in the evening of the Epiphany night celebration in Dublin in 1904. in conventional "dramatic" terms. They entertain their guests; There are songs, dancing, recitations and very little talk, but looking at this movie, you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather than be in this company. Finally, it is of course 'about' much, much more. It is about love, loss and regret, the stable support staff of great drama. In the film's final scenes, tenor Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings a song, 'The Lass of Aughrim', which evokes in Gretta's greeting, (Anjelica Huston), Gabriel's wife, Donal McCann, the Ghost in his first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in all security in a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly Gabriel realized that he had never known his wife and that he had not been the great love of life after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as Gretta tells the circumstances of her beloved's death and then as the voice of Gabriel's head sums up her own feelings. This is great cinema, the monologues delivered excellent by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But then all the performances are extraordinary. This is the highest order ensemble game and while it would be invidious to single out a performer over another, the screen has ever given us a more sympathetic, brilliant or compelling full than Donal Donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that Sean McClory, (IRA man in "The Quiet Man"), leads to his reading of Lady Gregory's translation of "Donal And" here? Added poignancy must of course be of the knowledge that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film, which seems to me the culmination of his life's work. Death may well be its central theme, but viewing this movie is a life-enhancing experience.
