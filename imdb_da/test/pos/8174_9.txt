I have found this epic to be of astonishing, striking and even heartbreaking beauty. Some kinds of monuments in beauty and decorative wealth, a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. Choreography in this is very fun, the actors are thoroughly enjoyable. I have been a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER ?? so good but it was even better. They delight Kitano's ingenuity in what is comfortable. This beautiful affirmative adventure cinema is a fashion training. When was the tension so exquisite and genuine? And the art of showing great crowds, giant armies ??. The film has something deeply satisfying and a good taste. There is a huge pleasure in making such a deliberately impressive and clean show. It's good beyond words. Few fairy-tale films, let alone epics, gave me such undisturbed joy. <br /> <br /> Fan may be monumental. also as the hobbits trilogy. It is large ?? size fun.
