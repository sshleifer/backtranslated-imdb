At the end of the Universal Monster horror movie cycle and before the golden age of sci-fi movies, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and incorporates some of the more ostentatious (read: enjoyable) elements that would characterize sci-fi movies in the upcoming era. Lon Chaney Jr. plays Wolf Man, and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the Frankenstein monster. A mad scientist sets out to "cure" both monsters of their "diseases" using modern {read: mad} science. Therefore, when the scientist's beautiful nurse assistant is revealed to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer becomes aware that this movie does not typically become universal fare; This film overshadows the kind of dizzying we would take for granted in the 1950's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind the older movies being slower pacing, and black and white don't throw you off, this movie is recommended to watch. Afaik, this one is not available on DVD, but AMC floats it occasionally, so keep an eye out or you can always wish it on your TiVo!
