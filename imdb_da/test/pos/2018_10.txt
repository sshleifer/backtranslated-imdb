After reading previews of this movie, I thought it would be a disappointment, but after I got my region 1 DVD (the DVD was available before the movie hit the week's cinemas), I was pleasantly surprised, strong performances from all cast members make this a very entertaining movie. The fact that the script is rather weak means that you are not run down in history, and therefore the repetition factor is greater. I recommend this movie to one and all <br /> <br />
