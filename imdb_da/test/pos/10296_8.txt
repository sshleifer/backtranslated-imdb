Forget about the recent, expensive American remake, which unfortunately hardened the reputation of the French original by virtue of the Director's involvement in both. This is a successful romantic 90's noir with many twists. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's rear window, because the concept of voyeurism is the constant theme that burns the intricate manuscript. The story is surprisingly realized as a Picasso painting that offers more perspectives on the same event and requires the participation of the forces all the way through. The settings, music and haunting scores are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast. See it more than once.
