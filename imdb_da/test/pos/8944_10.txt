I accidentally hit this movie on Cinemax while surfing the web. I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the setting was the kind I want so I started to see it. At first I had expected a serious drama film, and it seemed for a while ... until I started giggling here and there, and before I know it, I ran so hard the whole movie. I really like how subtle and light it is, but still have a great influence on the audience. The reason is very simple and it is far from trying too hard to be fun as many Hollywood "comedies" are, but it has almost made me roll on the floor. A must see for a good night rest or preferably in that case.
