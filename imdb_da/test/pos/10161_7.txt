"The Man Who Were Too Much" falls into the Hitchcock center that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: Not a masterpiece of excitement in any way, but a horrible lot of fun nonetheless. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a holiday couple caught in a plot heavily on foreign intrigue. The famous climate game takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is murdered during a particular cymbal clash in the score. The confusing Hitchcock makes it possible, of course, to know what is going on, so the drive to stop the murder becomes a nail-biting race against the cymbalist. So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play", which I believe the movie was inspired by this. Neither movie is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
