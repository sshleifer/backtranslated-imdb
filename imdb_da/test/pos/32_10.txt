LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer movie, as the author adapted his own life story to the screen. This brilliant movie ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, great direction by George C. Wolfe, and a throw so amazing that they make an encore view mandatory! Yes, it's just as good. The story is based on the author's life as the child 'Junior' (Marcus Carl Franklin) grew up in the unimaginable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson), a lady who dedicated her life to helping them be deprived of transporting those from the south, from mental hospitals and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the experiences he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd signs of painful past - and from the breakdown of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny. The myriad signs in the home are too many to outline, but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the company: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> During the film, we are introduced to racism of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of substance abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American music contributing to our musical culture and the courage of a fine woman who fought for all those hardships that the world can distinguish to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is completely immersed in this role, a role she shines like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most amazing performances of the past few years, and if this movie was released in the theaters instead of an HBO movie, she would undoubtedly add Oscar to position herself with the Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is unusual, and Wolfe handles the play and the story as a master: as riffs in a jazz piece, he sticks small moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with scene scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with great care, and never for a moment is the attention delayed from the momentum of history. Highly recommended, almost mandatory view! Grady Harp
