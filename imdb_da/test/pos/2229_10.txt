Although you often considered Peter Sellers' worst movie, it's actually an excellent send-up of medical company corruption and abuse. Often misunderstood, the movie is actually a deviation from the type of movie Sellers were best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and Karate Kid movies), but was characterized by its greasy, irreverence and overall madcap demolition of today's medical industry. It was before his time (1972) to take the monstrous road that the Monty Python crew would take to the cinema sometime later. As such, it was unacceptable for the traditional Peter Sellers fan who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to something they were not used to. At the moment, Peter Sellers film is in demand by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt ?, is by nature almost impossible to find.
