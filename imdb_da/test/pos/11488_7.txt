"Committed" is about Graham as an irrepressible optimist looking for his self-alien man who has been searching for himself, all leading to a sort of upscale comedic odyssey involving a bunch of sidetracks and problems. A fresh, fun and unpredictable little flick, what "Committed" lacks in history, it constitutes in good naturedness and subtle morals and maxims. If you enjoy this little chick flick who got a little over the average of reviews from critics and the public, you might want to look out Lisa Kruegers hit Indie "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
