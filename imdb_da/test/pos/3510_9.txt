I saw this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young child, and that scared Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I died to get my hands on it. In 2002 I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to I Need to know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone at IMDb told me so I investigated and tried to buy the movie. So eventually I got it on DVD, and now I keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. I really love it and I think everyone who sees it will be very scared in the forest the next time they go. 10.9.
