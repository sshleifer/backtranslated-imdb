Stanwyck and Morgan are completely cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensitivity. The movie's success depends on the cast of the Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercises control over his staff - until Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' to the Greenstreet, who had been one of the scene's big Falstaffs when he was part of Lunts' company. The Greenstreet had only entered film five years earlier when, at age 61, he participated in what would become a movie classic, the first and best film, John Huston, who has ever directed: 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in its traditional role as the performance of inter-European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used in most of the film is an eye-sensing gem.
