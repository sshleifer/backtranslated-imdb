Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor John Malkovich. His criminal attempt to murder the president was first-rate and credible. <br /> <br /> It is not to diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a true jerk of a white chief of staff. Eastwood was great and I love any movie that Russo is in. <br /> <br /> The movie has original music by five Oscar winners (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, Mission, Heaven's Days) Ennio Morricone. It alone makes it worth your time.
