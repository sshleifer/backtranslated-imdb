Marigold is by far the best "outsider's" take on Bollywood I've ever seen. (I didn't grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them now.) I would say it leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair, and even Merchant and Ivory (of Bombay Talkie) almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and he has the confidence to let us know - there is humor, but no bow, ironic distraction, no "of course, I don't really understand" things. As Jerry Lee Lewis would say he "gets it" and then he can also let us get it - the joy of a Bollywood movie experience with touches delivered by a Westerner entering the storyteller's role. /> <br /> It's a story of a caustic, bitchy, beautiful American B movie actress (she's only been in movies with tracks in their titles, such as Fatal Attraction 3), which finds herself in another bollywood movie from it she went to India to be in (Kama Sutra 3 has folded her tents while she was on her way, apparently because its producers are now in prison). Salman Khan, in fact a Bollywood mega-mega star, is the dance master of the lovely movie she has now been drawn to ("is this before or after I go blind?") And through the sweetness of his mildly psychic character she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dance business. The strong beginning gives you both Bollywood - a super-energetic group of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both fun and known for the Western seer, and delivers the high musical excitement we love in a Hindu movie) and Salman on the screen from the start - no Bollywood 20 minutes waiting for the hero. He has an Indian costume decorated with Kit Carson-style western film edge (all in white). Ali Lart's actress character is gratifying for the Western seer - she is blonde who is "traditional" to a "white" person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting - but she is a robust girl, not the ethereal kind of blondie we normally are Presented to, and she is a more or less three-dimensional total bitch, practicing profane and violent cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the United States. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women having problems with each other, going out in a bar to handle them - the ability of people not to get along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in Hindi movies, but we rarely see much of such things going on between women (except for the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom), let alone "strangers" - independent people - let alone bar-going. So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I was totally happy about this. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, in an example that came from the director, a nice speaker and questioned swarmman - he and Salman should be "brother-like" good friends over doing what he loves India, he plans to make an Ov film in India. I can't get too detailed about songs when I've seen them just once, except to say I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of the Bollywood number in the film-in-movie - the women's suits, with Leghorn hats and snail-cased bodices (it's a beach scene) on floating dresses - worth the price of a ticket alone - to a lovely reflective, multi-stage romantic song in a more sad and more serious part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Mix of Hindi and English in the music and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-Mann - and good judgment about which ones to be in. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all the way through perfectly (that is, not narcissist at all), whether Carroll accepted or rejected them - clearly just a pro who loves to be involved and collaborate.
