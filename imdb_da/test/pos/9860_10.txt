The moving picture museum here in New York has recently set out a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette's film. After falling in love with his "Paris Nous Appartient," I didn't decide to miss it. <br /> <br /> Far through expanded images and flexibly structured scenes, the film depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their releases by Aeschylus "Seven Against Thebes" and "Prometheus". In addition, we are shown the pointless daily lives of two people who are remotely associated with the businesses: a working class woman named Frederique, who finds creative ways to wake men out of their money, and a young man named Colin who visits local cafes constitutes a deaf attenuation and plays sharp harmonics with the borrowers until they pay him to go away. The first four hours or so are used to establish the signs and their patterns before a somewhat loose, moody plot finally arises with a conspiracy and decoding of secret secret letters. <br /> <br /> The movie is about life on the outskirts of society. The theater companies are a despair affair using their elaborate, emotional drainage exercises (there really is something to see) to distract themselves from the fact that their actions will hardly be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends who only briefly find excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them as they are asked to find out more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of rejecting the normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of Colin, while walking in the streets of France and shouting poetry to himself. As such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of the 1960s counter-culture. <br /> <br /> There is no frame of the movie that does not burst with energy and vitality. The fact that many of the dialogue and movement are improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important sign in this regard; Throughout the movie boom, shadows are visible here and there or other similar errors, but they work naturally and match the flow of action, because the camera is so important a player in it. <br /> <br /> More than anything I think the movie is a good example of another way to make movies, a place for movies beyond the usual pattern. For me, it was a thinking experience, even more so than "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter carries many similarities between theme and structure. A must-see for anyone considering the nature of art.
