Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister in Sweden. At death she died, "Send to David Holm!" But Victor Sjöström (like David Holm) cannot be placed because he spends New Year's Eve in a cemetery with his drinking mates. The dying sister Astrid Holm (as Editors) wants to see if praying for Mr Sjöström's soul during the last year has yielded results; It probably won't. In the cemetery Sjöström tells the story of "Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person who dies every year will pick up all the dead people's souls until they are relieved next New Year's Eve ... Director Sjöström, whose driving performance is very strong, combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. The large "double exposure" effect is often used, but never seems excessive; And that doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable (for example, Sjöström's tear on his sewn coat and the door's axing). A Selma Lagerlöf story was probably not one you could or would like to bitch with in the 1920s - which may or may not be why the end of this movie is a downturn. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it is difficult to suspend your disbelief if you think too carefully about what is really happening in the "carer". <br /> <br /> ******* The driver (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
