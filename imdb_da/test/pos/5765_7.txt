bound by its absolute highest perfection. Who ever says slap stick comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong. not that this movie will only appeal to those who are masculine in nature. This is another British British dark comedy with many many jokes that are not related to violence, but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the stupid thing of it all. <br /> <br /> This is a true example of thriving British ingenuity and home-made talent hats to them. At a performance level, it reminds me very much of the British brothers' early works, where the same enthusiasm and devotion is present in their acting style, resulting in a show where audiences can truly engage the innate human desire to see others, but yet be detached and still feel safe, like the principle that many TV chat shows work on. a truly amazing manipulation that gives all parties a better feeling.
