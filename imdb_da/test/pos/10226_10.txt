I absolutely love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and saved it to look at my birthday. This movie has several questions. The one is. Who are the monsters in this world? Being different is just that. Various. The real monsters hide behind ordinary masks. They are the ones who all consider "a nice quiet blocks" that "didn't bother anyone". Or they are worse, they are the characters that Croneberg plays. Men who draw joy and power from cutting people and creating their own books of blood. I love the shapeshifs, people with gifts and those who can be abominable to people watching. This movie touches and explores what is normal. Who are 'others' and what fear do some. Although I gave this movie 10, I'm still sick for women who either scream or are so put in their ways that they can't see what's happening and be a vehicle for the things that destroyed the median. My second complaint was why they never made any other movie. I for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most exciting story that keeps me imprisoned from the beginning to the end
