I really liked this movie - not so much for the story (which was okay but was a bit slow in spots) but moreso for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is absolutely engaging as John Cassavete's carefree love interest - a man "on the edge". But the landscape! Oh oh!
