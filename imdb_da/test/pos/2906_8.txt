I was going out one morning when I checked something on T.V. and came across this movie. I can never remember seeing this or listening to it. What a fun and interesting to see. Well, my meeting was pushed back because I couldn't get out of this movie. It had some really interesting things in it that marked it's time in history and some fun things that they don't have people doing in today's movies because it's not beautiful. Well, there was much realism in it. The action was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and true actions from the characters that made me see what to do next time. That's why I ended up seeing it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I'd rather see this than some movies they play more than necessary. For history buffs, people who like period movies and those who are in movie appreciation groups will like this. "The Egyptian" has a number of flavors that deal with a lot of things to look at in human nature that have not changed since it's time. What does it say about us? Those who don't like movies that take the time to unfold and tell a good story .... aren't into movies. I didn't have time to rent it, if available, but if I get a chance to see it again, I'd probably vote it a 10.
