Had it been with the one who raised you since you were young? You just want her away from your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her if she is ill or good. But in times it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. This was how Owen (Danny DeVito) had handled in "Throw Momma Fron The Train". Hans Momma (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He tries his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calling him a "clumsy poop", a "larda $$" and "bold" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), he has his own female problems, his former wife. She's trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What is he doing? Help return to benefit, get rid of Mrs Lift! In the kitchen I liked what Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty". And Momma said, "You don't have a cousin Patty!" and Owen shouts, "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they are on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. It is contradicted and she kicks Larry out of the train. Well, everything back to the normal, living ex-wife, but Momma kicked the shovel alone. Perhaps she should have seen the mistakes in her dominant ways. A funny movie is that and the cast is amazing. A classic! 5 stars!
