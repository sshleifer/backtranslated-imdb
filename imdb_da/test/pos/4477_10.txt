This movie is beautiful in every way. It is visually stunning and that is a good thing, as the dialogue would only take one page or two paper. The action is amazing; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fantastic job of turning into an animal and mixing the wild nature with a man's indulgent passion and honor. There is no mistake, not a mistake or a wrong moment to be found anywhere. It's perfect, but only if you understand what you want to experience. It's not a movie for anyone who wants normality.
