I must admit that I have been a big fan of the almighty David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff ever since he starred in hit 80's television series "Knight Rider." Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilarious raunchy "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant depiction of a dashing prince in the Schlocky Sci-Fi gem "Starcrash", Hoff has repeatedly proven that he is a simply amazing (and shamefully underestimated) actor's supreme. The Hoff is distinguished here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, along with his repressed virgin comrade Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) examines a dingy, counterfeit haunted hotel located on a remote island off the shores of the Massachussetts. They do research on witchcraft through the ages, and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced black art. A bickering family also shows up on site to check out the hotel. Right now, different people are beginning to get hit in the various horrific ways of the mysterious Lady in Black (an efficiently eerie Hildegard Knef). Permitted, the rest of the throw gives Hoff a run for his money: The magnificent Linda Blair designs her usual charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who wins up to being obsessed (natch!), Legendary jazz singer Annie Ross bitches it with joy aplomb as a beautiful old bat (bad Annie wins up burned alive after she has her lips sewn closed and she's hung up and down in a chimney), and beautiful blonde Catherine Hickland radiates considerable sex appeal from every downloading pore like a lusty blunt. Fabrizio Laurenti's competent direction, an appropriately spooky atmosphere, Gianlorenzo Battaglia's smooth, shiny filmography (the fluid-problematic Steadicam tracking shots are particularly nice), the scary special effects, Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's spiritual shuddery'n's pokery score and gory, sadistic violence are completely up to each other. But in the end, the hugely dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only Hoff that makes this choice tasty cloth of sticky Italian cheek cheese is such a winner: He takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!), Gets sprayed with blood and - - WARNING: Major * SPOILER * ahead - even meets a pleasantly grisly endless end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this picture is generally so good, fun fun.
