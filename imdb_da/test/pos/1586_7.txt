A boiling but fun little diversion. You have to see it from the beginning to follow what is happening, but every report to the ground has its own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi. show. It's fun to see. Kind of in the red dwarf's vein, but even more low budget. For a person who just comes into the middle of one of the episodes, you must realize that these guys are incompetent because they have been moved up by the command line because the other officers died. Also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you will probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, because all you see is the commander's report every day. It would be better if this was explained more, not just at the beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf if you hadn't been told.
