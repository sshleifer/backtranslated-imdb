Night of the Demons is definitely one of the final ostey 80's demons screaming flick in the same vein as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons movie. This movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons in a hell of a fun movie. A definite welcome addition after the 80s was overrun by slasher flicks, it was nice to see something a little different. The plot follows a group of teenagers who all meet up for a Halloween party in the hull house, which used to be a funeral room, hosted by Angela. About 40 minutes of blasting and sexualization eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the oven and possessing every one of the teens. Add some snazzy make-up effects, lots of gore and sawn demons, and you've got yourself a cute 80's cheese party that would be ranked as one of the best demon-related movies in many horror fans' lists. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I loved the setting for this movie, "Hull House" is really scary and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons come up, that's when the action really kicks in and It becomes a night of terror and fear. This movie created 2 successors, the first in 1994, which was okay, but nothing was ready for this, and the third titled Demon House was absolutely horrible. This is one of the horrors that has clearly stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come. All in all, a fun cheesy flick with demons that is definitely worth checking out.
