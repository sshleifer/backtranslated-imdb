Gerald McRaney, (Dave Morgan), "War Crimes", "01 TV Series", was like a father of Tiffani Thiessen, (Jennifer Gallagher), "A Kiss Before Lying", 03, experiencing a very bad situation in her life and it made Jennifer be pulled back with people and young men. Dave Morgan desperately tries to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher) who falls in love with her at their very first meeting. On almost one or two dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she wants to marry him and she agrees. It's not very long after the wedding that things start to happen, Chris is in the fleet and doesn't like working in submarines and things are starting to happen with young gals in the neighborhood. This is a very excellent TV movie, and it sometimes makes you doubt whether the guy or the crazy I want as Soul mate is the perfect person!
