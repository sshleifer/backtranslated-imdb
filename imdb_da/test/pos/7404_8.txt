Sometimes good things happen accidentally. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005 - I ran channels and happened to see something on Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill attacked by the owl. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was hard to wait for a commercial so I could figure out what it was called! <br /> <br /> Part of what fascinated me was the appearance of the bats - first and foremost, they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats "extra fingers" where their thumbs are supposed to be. Instead, they have palms as human hands, but their fingers are longer and have skin skin between them. <br /> <br /> Also, the faces - they look like humans (in fact at one point I wondered if they had ever been human but were turned into bats). Normally, I don't like this in cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, though it's about bats and other animals (not unlike The Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on television was the last two parts of the "trilogy". I had missed the start of the first, the "Towers of Fire", but mostly I saw all of them. But I found myself understanding what was going on when the first part wasn't on, and I wouldn't have caught it anyway. <br /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel. How lucky I noticed and wrote it down - I was very disappointed when I learned that the series was not available! It wasn't even that it made sense recently that it wasn't available yet. <br /> <br /> But I found not only the book Silverwing, but also the two successors Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I failed to wonder "Is that it?" Not only because much of what is in the series is not in that book, but even if I had not seen the animated version, the book Silverwing (otherwise a good story) does not end as much as it stops. Only a loose end is bound - Shade and Marina meet the Silverwing colony at Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should (in my opinion) have been published in a single volume because they make for a complete story together but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version takes some elements from Sunwing (eg Orestes, lift the ban on seeing the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it is certainly very enjoyable. I enjoy both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am happy that it will finally be available in June. It was a long time to come and it is worth waiting for.
