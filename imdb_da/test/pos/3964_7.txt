When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to be excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's just the case. People went into the Accept looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the type of movie that is meant to be a good movie. It is supposed to be a movie that welcomes its crowd without too much effort being given. That said, for those of you who were expecting a big movie, think about what could be done by a comedy like this one. Think about it and you'll really enjoy the movie (because you want to get rid of your idea that the movie will be great.) BOTTOM LINE: Watch the movie and have fun, but don't look for something groundbreaking.
