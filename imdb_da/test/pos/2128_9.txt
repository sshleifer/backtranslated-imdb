This movie was very cute and very little girl appropriate. My nieces have seen it non-stop since they got it, and as a result I have seen it almost 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are good to look at, humor is good, and the ballet images are excellent. Although the story has a few holes, no little girl will pick them up, and as an adult, the film is so charming that you hardly notice. Just keep in mind that it is a Barbie movie, and although it is cheesy at times, it seems to me to live up to the high standard that other Barbie princess movies have set for it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
