Of course, the Simpsons started with the Christmas special "Simpsons roasting on an open fire", which had basic drawings and not laughing loudly jokes, but this episode probably has the first laugh high in it, and from here the view is just getting better and better. This episode is centered around Bart, who in this episode offers a test from Martin and enters a high school school, leading Bart to meet his friendship with his father and lose all his fellow comrades. The episode is very humorous and shows what was going to be the biggest show ever to come out. Overall fans of the show will love this episode as it contains the character's exact as they were 20 years later. Then watch this episode in a package season 1 and enjoy early Simpson doing what it was supposed to make people laugh. I rate this episode 73%.
