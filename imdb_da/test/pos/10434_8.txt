The last American virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies I really enjoyed. The subject and play was way beyond the usual tripe that Hollywood was (and still is) turning out these days. But for a while, the smaller studios produced films about teenagers who were not toned down or softer for the kiddies. The men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from Cannon. <br /> <br /> Three teenage comrades are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They want to do somebody or something to reach their dream goals. The Sensitive Group (Andrew Monsoon), what is finding the right girl while his two best friends will take what they can get. One day the child finds her perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of their foul tricks. His best friend moves in and sweeps her out of her feet. After beating her up, the sensitive child helps the girl back on her feet and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, his best friend has a very violent outcome over getting her dream girl preggers. Still, he tries his best to make her love him. The night comes when he runs the question to her. But his heart is crushed when he sees her dance with her former best friend. In tears, the child leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed about this movie was that it didn't take any blows. Instead of being filled with false situations, it was very realistic, honest, and brutal. The movie is filled with it's part of fun moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie to fans of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
