Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. One negative review happens to be (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" to be one of the best movies almost no one has ever heard of as I have seen this year. It's 6.4 rating is misleading and can be more a function of the tricky subject than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie allegedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a positively gripping psychological thriller. I was almost on the edge of my seat all the time. It's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well thrown. In a fair world, actress Judith Ivey would win awards to keep you guessing whether she was good or evil. <br /> <br /> Ignore the score and see this amazing movie. (And besides, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
