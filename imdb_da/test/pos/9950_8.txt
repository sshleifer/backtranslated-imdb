This is a valued movie from my childhood !! I can still hum theme song on the drop of a hat !! I remember getting up late to watch this movie with my dad, usually two to three times a year. We have always referred to it as "Giant Robot". Although the effects in this movie are raw compared to today's standards, they were perfect for this movie genre. I'm also a big fan of the Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie just fell in love with the others. It's been years since I've seen this movie and would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter.
