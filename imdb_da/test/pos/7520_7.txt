I had never been very aware of this flick before I learned that Paddy Chayefsky - author of the brilliant "Network" was the scriptwriter. His work that had instructed me on his genius, so when "Hospital" appeared on TMC, I was eager to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this movie and "Network", it seems that his big theme is the absurdity, inanity, and pure evil of great human companies (eg, hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit and all it provided with a knife edge sense of completely black humor. "Hospital" is so kind of a comedy as "Network" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, makes his work full justice. This is a keeper; absolutely not to be missed.
