I totally disagree with the other comments! I also watched this movie on an early screening and found it quite fun. Robin Williams is in top form. True, the tone is known, but it is Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, fun, on point. After too many dark turns, Williams is finally back to what he does best. The support actors provide fantastic performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays as usual, but as an "agent" to the next president, he was a joy every time on the screen. Lewis Black only plays in himself, but he is wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun trip by Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than what the trailer suggests, as well. The movie is fun, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a bit of a thriller line that everyone should seriously consider, especially if you are watching the newspaper.
