I saw this movie on a fly. I stood on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home, and a sister started sending free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave it a chance not expecting much. The promotional movie posters I have seen on the subway walls do not give this movie justice at all. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craftsmanship and art of heavy metal. I want to be there. The movie is a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. If you're old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the 80s music scene, you'll love this movie. Jack Black is an incredibly talented comedian and actor and if he really wrote and performed the songs in this movie, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worth a visit!
