I have mixed feelings about this movie, especially as it compares to its predecessor, <br /> <br /> "An American werewolf in London." The movie had fun moments, it was still more of a horror story than anything else. This updated version, which is now set in Paris, has not at all the "edge" and is simply not in the same class .... but it has some good things that go to the fact that the first movie did not have and generally it is still fun to see. <br /> <br /> So, "werewolf purists" aside, most of whom think this movie is pure waste compared to the London version, I will still give it decent characters since I don't care, what others think. I liked it even though I agree "London" is better and I also prefer that version. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this movie are played strictly for laughs, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also introduces the leading female character that Julie Delpy plays. I can't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to do many movies, or at least those I hear about here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the movie has points to have her in it and she looks great. <br /> <br /> When the horror starts, it can be daunting and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this movie, unlike the first: no f-word and no the Lord's name in vain - amazing! <br /> <br /> But there are lots of sexual remarks and there is a scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross that was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal, which is not appealing to a middle-aged guy like me either. This movie is geared much more towards 20-somethings if it helps anyone. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining ..... Don't expect to live up to the first movie.
