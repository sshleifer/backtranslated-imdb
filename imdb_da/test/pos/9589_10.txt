OK ... time for a little rant I think. It has been 2 years since I submitted my original comments that price this top-rated footy comedy ..... and the horrible thing has still not made it into video or DVD (or for that matter has even been repeated on telly!!) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone out there know why not? Has there been a BBC style bug that has deleted / deleted / deleted the original copy? <br /> <br /> Listen to your mass with responsibility for ITV - pass it on to DVD now !!! Are you aware of how fun this program was? It does "Mike Bassett" no matter what the current pants Spurs team. <br /> <br /> Rant over. Currently.
