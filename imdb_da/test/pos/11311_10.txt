Julie Brown beats beat Madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and captivating songs that rival Madonna's own. Cinematography and sets are top notch. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedies that enhance and compliment this movie. The appearance of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale is an added advantage. <br /> <br /> It is hard to know if Brown's performance is supposed to offend or mutilate Madonna, although I hardly believe that Material Girl will find humor in it. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Why don't you come here (to the Philippines); all they eat is dog and I'm a vegetarian."
