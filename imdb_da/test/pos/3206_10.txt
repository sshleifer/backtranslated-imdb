Gilmore Girls is a fun show with never ending sarcasm, wit and charm. At age 16, Lorelai gave birth to Gilmore Rory Gilmore. She left her parent's house and got a job. Now Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have a broad knowledge of movies and TV shows and cite them constantly. In the first season, Lorelai has money to send Rory to Chilton (a very high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents. They are happy to give them the money, but in exchange, Rory has to come with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I love it!
