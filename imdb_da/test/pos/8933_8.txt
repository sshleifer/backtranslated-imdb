I want to watch this movie for a very long time. At last I just bought it on E-Bay, as it is so hard to find the state side. But the wait was worth something. <br /> <br /> I can't say the movie was amazing. And I can't say the movie was fun. But it was good and it has some really fun points. Securing the shots in this movie is just beautiful. And the whole role, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I hadn't seen before before) was excellent. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a good romantic comedy and I recommend checking it out unless you have just had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is well worth the money. >. <
