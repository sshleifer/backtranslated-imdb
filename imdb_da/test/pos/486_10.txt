I just saw it for the second time today, and I have to say with all my heart it is about horrible time, they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was perhaps a good thing, coming out of it. And Eric is warmer than ever. Too often in the films is understood the former people as other than ordinary people. We are always portrayed as executives or medical professionals. Hey, we're like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is finished and we can win in search of justice. It's really bad that the big movie companies can't see it. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was.
