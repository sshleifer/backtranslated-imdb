I have to admit that before I watched this movie, I thought that this is one of the mushroom love stories where everything works fine and dandy all the way through. but I was proven wrong when I actually sat down to see this. I found out that it was actually a really good story about a family going to a dance park for a 3 week holiday, and finding the youngest daughter, baby, love, but having trouble coming with her new, found love because of disagreement with her father. But along the way, another dance instructor helps and risks the whole relationship ... A truly heart-warming movie like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
