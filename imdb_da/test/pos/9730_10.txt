This is probably one of my favorites so far, even though I have the first and seen Curse, Legacy and vs. Demonic Toys. The only one better than this is PM vs. DT. Curse is the worst in the series than the first, and then its heritage. I recommend people to watch this and vs. DT. Those who say this sucks are so wrong, the story is well written, and it's a cute movie. This is a classic movie, even younger children can see and not be so scared when they look at the others. Well this is my review, you can call me Gipdac (it's easy to know where it came from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can see it at Toon Disney at 4:00 AM). Oh and don't laugh, I'm a guy you want to see more of my reviews well in advance. If you want to know why I see it? I am 12! Word advice: Have a mental meal, arrr√∏ooooooooooo! I also agree with you recipes-1, but why people like the others are because they are more exciting than horror and because the puppets are made to look scary. You can also call me Gipdac.
