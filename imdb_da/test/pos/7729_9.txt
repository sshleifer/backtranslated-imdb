Excellent film in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has succeeded in portraying the time (1830) with careful care. The light, the places, the feeling, is perfectly perceived from the start of the film. And along with it - unlike what happened with "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a pretty episodic historical movie - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing wraps a very fluid script that reaches its climax in the only possible manner. <br /> <br /> For the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is excellent: lies, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a slightly less convincing audience about his immediate evil love for Carmen, but he manages to convey the right tragic mood to the entire movie. I recommend it to everyone: this year's best Spanish film.
