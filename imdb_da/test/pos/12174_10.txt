These two main characters Erkan and Stefan are a munich comedy act. I wondered if this is one of those typical slapstick movies, where the story is neither important nor simply non-existent. But when I watched this movie, I was very happy that there is a cool story, and the protagonists fit really well into it. All in all, very funny and not an ordinary German movie.
