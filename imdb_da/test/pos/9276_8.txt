I suppose there are several cuts in this doco that do the rounds. The copy I saw focused strongly on Joe's erotic films and referred to his horror production in passing. There are many X-rated movies presented in their X-rated honor and EMMANUELLE IN AMERICAS legendary "snus" footage (the breasts are cut off) is given generous screen time. <br /> <br /> The very sympathetic Joe interviewers are informative and honest. He is a modest, articulated gentleman, and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix horror eroticism and how he might have been responsible for one of his homosexual artists. <br /> <br /> His friendship and relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser is concerned, as does his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore. Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in Continental Cinema, which has now gone. It is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
