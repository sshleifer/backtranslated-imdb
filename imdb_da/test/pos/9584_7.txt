OK, so I admit it often seems that most Sylvester / Tweety couples have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but repeatedly fails and is always hit in the process, often using a bulldog. I think it's like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go for birds). "All a Bir-r-rd" has the same plot and puts it on a train. That way, the best part of these cartoons looks at what kind of schemes Sylvester is going to try to follow Tweety. We know he's going to fail miserably, but it's also fun to see Tweety turn into a bad ass (if you've seen his really early cartoons, you'll see that he wasn't "cute" at all, but in reality had a cruel touch). This way works mainly as a way to pass time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean, I tighten taw - Sylvester sends a piece of luggage called Friz Freleng on it.
