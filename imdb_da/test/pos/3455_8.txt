I watched this movie during a specially advanced example in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, make a friendship when Rory is introduced to the nursing home that Michael already lives. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, so far his cerebal palsey made people believe he couldn't communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he lacks. Rory is a feisty character who does not make his condition (Muscular Dystrophy) to him. <br /> <br /> They tie and apply for independent living and find a nice flat and assistant and have fun being able to ever dream of. <br /> <br /> Don't go to watch this movie if you're after some "entertainment". Go to watch this movie if you are willing to see something a little different. The storylin is strong, the actors are amazing and despite the sadness that comes with the film, the mood is lifted. <Br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. Although you are something like me and prone to crying - take tissue that you need them!
