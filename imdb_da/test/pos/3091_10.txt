It would be something to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply. Or maybe it's not: Herzog goes to the Sahara Desert and the nearby villages to film different landscapes and locals. But it's just the widest kind. It is a task that you either surrender yourself or you do not. He comes all the way into the world-form outside of a story, bound only to certain aspects of the written poetry, as his camera (shooting at presumably discarded film store) wanders as in a pure travel performance. You can even jump to the simple finish as he sets up these vast landscapes and then moves to more coarse civilized culture (though not the "normal" culture itself) and to a level of abstract to be able to convey it right here. Sometimes it takes a while to get together, close to a purity through the "creation" section, but a purity of how parts are manipulated either by nature or by broken machinery. Soon the story comes, the readings from Popol Vuh (which, incidentally, makes the music for most of his films), with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots, a completely different level to it. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are the best that comes closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", pictures he has been carrying throughout his career. One wonders if the images end at the time, the second section, paradise that leads along the words spoken, or if it is the other way around. Your eyes move along with the stills and pans, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there is also music selection, how the bizarre extra song and low-key classical music go together with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think every page ends up complimenting the other, and that's something that still seems * like it shouldn't work. Perhaps it's a move to it, the chances of going through desolate deserts and the smallest sections of every kind of civilized life (in this case the desert shelves) that make it so fascinating. If it is only in cinematographic sense, it is a wonder, also indescribable for the casual photographic fan because of techniques and some of the strangest images of any Herzog movie. There are pans that are long shots that are handheld as you drive off the cities, there are a bus dozens of miles away, which via mirage only works a couple, there are full close-ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and Talking about his radar (really classic gonzo comedy), there are people who still hold fake bags, and a man and woman who play music. But most importantly it feels like, at least for me, natural to the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I'm sure only Herzog would know for sure why he made this movie, as opposed to the simple "how"; He already filmed even dwarfs started small and he ended up going through many dangers to finish it. Still, Fata Morgana makes such an amazing experience - it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it by actually seeing it. It is quite disturbing, but there is the temptation to see it again very soon after, just to experience all the ideas and realities that were abstracted by strange vibes (yes the word "vibes" applies here). It is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
