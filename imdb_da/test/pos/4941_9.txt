When I played the first Soul Calibur on Dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second I was hooked. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a playstation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> It can really keep you up for hours, with lots of characters, lots of unlockable content and not mentioning a great battle system, this is really the biggest battle game to date. <br /> <br /> The game's strong points are first and foremost versus gameplay where two human players fight each other, either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and adapted character. Creating the character setting is great and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the "Grieve Edge" style (only kick), wear the ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is definitely the biggest fighting game you could want. Now I just hope that the scheduled movie will not be crap.
