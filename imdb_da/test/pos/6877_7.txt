I remember seeing this 1978 comedy on one of the merchants who I was taking in as I was looking for a study interruption from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson perform some effective Tracy-Hepburn styling-and-parrying in this featherweight body directed by the dependable Howard Zieff (he made "Private Benjamin") about a recent mage's aggressive resume in the dating game. The whole breeze of fasting mainly thanks to the clever script of veteran writer Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after his wife's death. When he returns, he becomes aware that he is an immediate catnip for all the women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile boss, Amos Willoughby, who Charley has to take care of his stay. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted English woman who bakes cheese cakes and has some concrete statements about the medical profession she freely expresses on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the show's discussion board and sparks, as they say, flying. This leads to the standard complications of how serious Charley is about becoming Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potentially wrongful lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball owner who died in the hospital during Willoughby's careless surveillance. It is just refreshing to see such a mature yet loving love story between two characters inhabited by actors providing lines with the surgeons' scalpel skills. Matthau is his usual 1970s curving turns and a good point of view with his grippy arms held akimbo in his flow. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is keenly sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the fairy-tale Ann, who believes all doctors should strive to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin kindly supports Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It is very compact with a few nice jabs on the greed of the medical profession. There is no extra on the 2005 DVD.
