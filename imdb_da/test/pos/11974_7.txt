I would consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; After reading a number of his novels and liked them all, but unfortunately I have never been reading the guards, so I am left with no choice but to judge this film on its own merits than comparing it to the book I did not read. I went into this expecting something terrible and while I didn't exactly get a brilliant horror movie; I lead to believe that it's fans of the book that assesses it because as a movie in itself, Watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie. The foundation, of course, takes some influence from the Predator and begins with an explosion at a research laboratory. It is not long before a ranch is killed by some strange animal and the love of the daughter of the dead has picked up an ultra intelligent trolley. A secret state agency is soon on the case as the murders continue. The boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence, but it somehow relates to the murders, and the agency is soon on the tail. <br /> <br /> The writing of this movie was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later disowned it. I do not know why ?? The writing here is not as close as ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash! Still, the biggest reason why this movie works, is undoubtedly the dog that, apart from being pretty sweet, is also the best actor in the movie. Corey Haim, the threat of success with The Lost Boys is human leadership and actually has a pretty good chemistry with the dog, although it is a bit ridiculous to see him talk it all the way through the film. The reason is rather flooded, and as such, the film is more than a bit messy; But the ridiculous of it all goes through in the more awkward moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and works well as the "bad cop" side of government agents. The monster is, of course, one of the most interesting things about the movie, and the way it goes about killing people is always entertaining and gory; Although we do not see much of it, and when we finally do, it is quite disappointing - of course, the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and Henderson's! Still, it is the kind of movie that can easily be enjoyed despite the many problems and I would recommend to any exquisite viewer of the eighties in the series.
