Nice combination of the giant monster and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, the god of the mountain, is a dismissed and forbidden figure that comes across much like the Old Testament God, reckons destruction and punishment over those who detest their sacred land - but it is interesting to note that what finally awakens him are not people's suffering, but a pointed and personal insult. It is beautifully photographed, with solid plays, beautiful miniatures and a fantastic score of the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a 400+ foot monster like Godzilla - he is 2 1/2 times normal size, so the evil samurai, he stumps into the ground, gets a good look at his disgusting eyes as he bears down on their fortress and smashes it to smedere. Not much in the form of extras, but it is great to see this forgotten less classic rescued and restored to the digital format.
