I think that those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some kind before, will be able to identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman still in the good health as it appears of her daily grind routine to wake up very early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work, where she must close bottles of Megmilk in a bag in a route around the city as clockwork, to exchange empty bottles to the full and collect payment and issue receipt. And there is always one delivery stop that is just at the top and it is necessary to scale a long staircase to get customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And, fortunately, it stopped happening to stop delivering to a man with whom she has fallen in love with almost all of her adolescent to adulthood, and not having been valued, but poured into sink. After going to the same school, we see that they do not talk to each other, and in their daily life it always looks so close physically, yet so far away. There is no eye contact, save for immediate glance by chance, and little recognition of each other's existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together, how clear the attraction between the two was hampered by the progress of the previous generation. <br /> <br /> While I thought Minako was an interesting woman in itself, one who has kept her emotions suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At some point, the days you read books" and that is correct, I felt the movie a wonderful final with the shot of its well-stocked bookcase, which probably indicates she is not Alone after all, and had probably fallen back on his crutch of varieties to handle the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle that she had already been used to for 50 years. In addition to immersing herself in two jobs, she has the books that serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally little sweet nothings for singing shows on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as an emotionally strong woman resigned from her fate and her decision to love no one else, her subject of love, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character with multiple facets . By being true to marriage vows, he spends considerable amounts of screen-time looking for his sick wife (played by Akiko Nishina) while juggling his social welfare work in the Child Affairs Department of the City Hall. I felt that as a childless couple, the job provided him with a means of nurturing, not alone, but for the children of others, the troubled ones who were neglected and left to cope with themselves. In a rare moment of rage, we see how he annoyedly welcomes such colorful parents who do not appreciate and waste their children's lives. <br /> <br /> The story of Kenji Aoki gives small quirks to appeal his characters and successfully tried to give many more glimpses and dimension to them, as well as how Takanashi is a hopeless Haiku poet despite being member of the Haiku club and supports characters such as the old Minagawa couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) borrowed some comic but sad moments as he slowly became senile while wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) tells and brings us through this love story of a single woman of 50 years. Even Akiko Nishina's performance as a drugged wife was nothing short of arresting with her enlightened state to know her husband's past and make selfless and painful decisions in her disease state. That's what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie that is young, nubile leading like starry-eyed lovers, but with all other elements in place like romantic set ups, love songs and those quintessential detained but loving behaviors. I thought the story was in danger of crashing into the beaten track when pristine love is being accomplished, but director Akira Ogata managed to remove the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although history required some obvious interpretation of the evolution of the final action that you can predict, especially if you are already past your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> Not being your average lovey-dovey story, I thought Milkwoman told a strong story of untouched love as a central theme and frankly a recommended romance movie (though it is said at a measured pace), if you are in the mood for some bittersweet love, reminiscence, and seeking to live without regret.
