The 13th and last RKO Falcon movie begins with Tom Conway's joint ban when Tom Lawrence is called Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No Ladies!" while preparing to go on holiday. While still wondering what they are going on vacation when they had not had a job since the start of the first movie in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie), they encounter a woman and are drawn promises to help her when her uncle gets murdered by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to get compensation for industrial diamonds for her business colleague in Miami. Suspects everyone here except the police here who is after Lawrence ?? and Goldie to the murder. To comfort himself, Goldie continues to rewrite travel brochures: "On the coldest day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cozy electric chair". Some cozy, dreary atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with a particularly bad behavior from evil. Favorite piece: The worthy game to hide and seek it smoothly, the unpleasant and suave Lawrence has with the evils on the sleeping train. Least favorite piece: The most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator break? definitely thrown in for the kids! All in all, not the best in the series, but another entertaining excursion with an overall gratifying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few years, as Columbia did with Boston Blackie , although RKO churning these out faster. Absolutely no sex, not much violence (in fact, none of today's high standards) and positively no message everyone makes this type of movie anathema to serious people who can only view movies as an art form to depend on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Later, Three Diet Falcon was made with John Calvert in the title role, I don't mind them, but could never make me count them in the main series that Tom Conway had made his own at this time. Unfortunately, it was completely downhill after this for Conway, who moved into television, voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in the Park Plaza 605 quite well in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems ?? I don't know if they were connected? discontinued poverty victims and after a hospital spelling in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For us people who would like at least we still have his 10 entertaining Falcon plus a number of other worthy, even classic RKO movies from 1942 to 1946, which he can remember him.
