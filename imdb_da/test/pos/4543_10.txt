For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best movie. David Spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin for Farley's "Baby Huey" yang. Farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like "Let's say you drive along the road with your family ..." bit, "Jo-Jo Idiot Circus Boy with a beautiful new pet, (his possible sale)" talk or "Glue-sniffing Guarantee Fairy" brake pad sales. The juicy moments in the film contrast sharply with Farley and Spades shenanigans. Even after many shows, it is still fun to see Farley pouring everything he had in the role. "Richard, what's HAPPING to me?!?!"
