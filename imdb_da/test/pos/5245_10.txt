I've just seen The Big Trail in the Vienna Film Museum for the first time. Immediately, I was amazed by both the images optically high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed history. Who has ever seen such a documentary western with John Wayne? And there is so much time you can actually look around the screen, there is so much to see! You are always grateful that the scenes are often static because each shot is so well composed and you want to take it. Even the play is good and fits in well. The long operating time of the picture is great, you won't miss a minute of it!
