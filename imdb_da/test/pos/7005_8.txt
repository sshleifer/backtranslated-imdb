The opening movie in this movie is pretty incredible. I have seen a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening order and he clearly said "sensory overload". The movie is quite simple, but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience find out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to "subtly" explain it. The creatures in this movie are also very interesting. You do not get a really good look at them until approx. two thirds of the way through. Overall, a very entertaining movie.
