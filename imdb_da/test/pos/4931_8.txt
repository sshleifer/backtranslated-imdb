According to this reviewer, the best time to be a child was in the 1990s, a period when comics were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air waves. The best producers of Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, which saw a great golden age with the dream play Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with serious and dark series such as Batman, they also revived zany outlandish cartoons that became famous by Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humor and tribute to celluloid of yesteryear and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was just as popular in reinventing Looney Tunes for a new generation while still holding the crazy comic book and intelligent comedy that can Stick to any age group, no matter how old. Even when the little toons were stretched to a length of how I spent my vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the TV series, a curse that so often plagues other feature-length adjustments of popular animated shows. /> <br /> Tiny Toon Gang are young springs from the classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh back in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to "earn their Toon degree". Summer holidays have started and each character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start a water gun battle that eventually leads to Acme Acres being flooded and they both sail into the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) ends Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a cross-country trip to the happiest theme park in the world, but Hamton's family proves to be more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) in other stories tries to find a cat to crush and squeeze. Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to go on a date with her favorite skunkster and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the cinema with a mouth-watering Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> While the premise is thin for a movie of its own length, the many directors and writers do all the stories well together. The best of these is Plucky's unfortunate flight, which exploits a valid comedian opportunity very well: Follow pity for someone while laughing at their difficulties. Plucky is an annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him, a perfect blend of script and animation, all in a small car filled with pork. Elmyra's story is absolutely unique to see how a little, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The aforementioned comic book surely comes in front of the history of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only because of the hilarity of the results, but also nostalgic, as Ruegger and company probably would not see half of what they do in the segment. Nearly half of this segment plays as a parody and tribute to Deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjo scene with the unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures themed song. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal appeal of Tiny Toons is that humor turns out to be very intelligent as it targets topics with a delusion that shows that it doesn't even deserve the title "Children's Danger" that people seem to slap it. A whole segment with Fowlmouth's bad label on the cinema poker fun on yappers in a note-perfect way along with an extra jab on the Lucasfilms THX logo. This scene is made so perfect that it should appear before each cinema shows. There are also a few moments that are fighting fun at Disney World, biographical plot holes and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and creative, makes the intelligent moments even more treasured, as there will probably not be another animated series that comes close. <br /> <br /> Having seen how I spent my vacation for the first time for many years, I can safely say that they do not do cartoons as they used to. With the ongoing censorship that receives today's family entertainment, one wonders whether something like this will ever be done again. This review is not only a recommendation of a really smart movie, but also a plea to Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to come together again and create a magical creation for our mind once again. Lord knows that the twenty-first century children need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. This is not a simple cash grab, it is a wonderful movie full of spirit, madcap mayhem and hilarity.
