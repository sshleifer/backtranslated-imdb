I have fun reading the user comments when I watched the movie! It seems that this is the classic either "Love it" or "Hate it" movie. And I have to say that I'm not just on "Love it" since, I go on a limb to say this here my FAVORITE film, EVER! Hi, I found it in the first place. Almost impossible to find, I was lucky ten years ago to record it from a true UHF channel. Of course, my taste by Sellers can make me a bit biased, but I can't see how anyone with a cornball, dry humor (like me) can't fall in love with this flick. The reason is great (but perhaps as a previous poster said, perhaps the reason why it's not a well-known movie ... disturbing the medical field?) The play is amazing (I can see why some might say the play was terrible .. But that's what made this movie so great ... it's totally sticky and humor is intestinal bust. I am proud to say that I have seen this movie not less than approx. 20 times and has virtually every line saved. This movie is genius !!
