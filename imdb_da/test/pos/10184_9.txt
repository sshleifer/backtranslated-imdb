I saw the other part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century. Golding's book should be responsible for some of the fantastic dialogues, but everything else was good too! I especially liked the way they created the period and the feeling of being on the ship as well. For me, this had a sense of completeness about what I know I can't convey in words ... Maybe it was the way they blended into technical and historical details of sailing for eighteen hundred to the story without crushing it up . Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, just like the rest of the cast. It is not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone" but this one did.
