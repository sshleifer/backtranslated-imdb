It is great to see a romantic comedy that does not have the pricey mandel, it has a solid action from both male leaders and also from the women's management, and although the story is a bit long and a little clich√©, you don't like it. <br /> I think the story was a little hasty at the end, but expanding it would have made history even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies like 100 days with Mr Arrogant and possibly associated with my tutor. <br /> <br /> It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as my sassy girl, but still good.
