This is one of my all-time favorite cheap, corny, vampire B movies. <br /> <br /> Calvin Klein's underwear model ... Oh, I mean, Stefan the good vampire, returns to Transylvania to raise the throne of Vampiric Royalty, but manic-weakened and ever-suffocating half brother Radu has other plans . After killing his father, the Vampire King, Radu now sets off on Stefan, Stephen's new mortal girlfriend Michelle and her two beautiful friends and the almighty Bloodstone. Okay, the scenery is beautiful and it has to be as it was shot on the spot in Transyl-fricken-vania for goshakes. The actresses are not good shakes and Stefan the heroic vampire is as charming as a chilled fireplace, but who cares? There is only one reason to watch this movie and his name is RADU! He is a physical tribute to Nosferatu, and he has the best lines in the movie. Everything is spoken in the rasping voice of a man who smokes ten packets of cigarettes a day. The Cemetery Festival scene is one of the best scenes in the movie as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his laughing, striking face to the world to see. I found myself cheering on him as he remedied victims and fooled his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sick man. Doubtful taste in men aside, I highly recommend this movie for vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... much more fun than the stiff, tragic, swirling Undead brats that infinitely grazed the horror screens these days . Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He is what a vampire should be.
