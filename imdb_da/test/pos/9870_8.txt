... don't like this movie and everyone would understand why. The reason is poor, so it is acting. But in my opinion, it's better than Halloween 5, even though it doesn't provide many surprising moments. A few scenes are really well-aimed. But these few moments do not provide the reason for renting it. I do not despise violence in movies, but the H6 has extraordinary strong and bloody scenes that do not fit the tradition of Halloween movies. The most sucking aspect of H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But don't expect a great horror experience .... <br /> <br />
