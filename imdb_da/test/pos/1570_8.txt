It's a sad state of Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've seen in the movie house since day 1. I literally had no idea how this movie should end because it left, when I Expected it went right, aimed when I was expecting a zag, etc. This could easily have been unraveled in generic suspense thriller or depressing white trash drama, but it became a course all the way to the end. However, it's a sad story. Not because of what is happening to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path. The plot has a quiet dignity of form, which is usually reserved for theater, but the pacing could use a little bit of feed. In any way, it is a very good movie, and for some reason I believe in sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.
