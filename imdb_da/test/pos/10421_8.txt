I agree with Aussie's comments for the most part. But id seems to be a pretty decent plot if it is unoriginal. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural estate, which she intends to open a mountain hut. She is being reacquainted with Chip (Bobby Johnston) as she had known when she grew up in there. The plot immerses when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane), because Christina had been James's stripper friend for many years, and the implication is that James had made her wrong in some way . To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a Romanesque novelist shows himself as a guest at the lodge, like Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), a couple of lawyers from the city. James assured the local building inspector at Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question is, "How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?" <br /> <br /> Look for Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed". She seems to make a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "bait", clearly the most monstrous character name in the movies!
