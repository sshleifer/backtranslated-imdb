I've been a great Errol Morris fan ever since I saw the Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. So far, this film is his best work. <br /> <br /> The reason is a mix of Stephen Hawking's book of the same title intertwined with man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled; It sounds quite boring, but the whole package is dynamic and thoughtful. The mixture of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was especially moved by how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man. The physically powerless, Hawking's grandeur and sharp shine are encased in a real living human being, which we are allowed to laugh at and over again at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. See it and enjoy. And if the studio that owns this picture reads this, a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
