This short, who won an Oscar, created two successors and a TV cartoon show, has minimal animation, but adelightful script (by Theodore Geisel aka Dr. Seuss) and another more memorable and enchanting protagonist. UPA pioneers an animation style that even affects Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. This is at their best. God to have it on print. Highly recommended.
