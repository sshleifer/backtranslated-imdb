I have seen both movies, and I no doubt saw that re-make is the best, I know many people would disagree with those who have become fans of the original, will probably not like this remake, but I thought it was well thought out and absolutely scary, it was so good i am going to see it again tonight, the original scared me out because they kill the kids, i mean who does it in movies anyway .... but in this child has at least half a chance ... The only bad part about this movie is when the childhood walker (Jill) walks toward the sounds she hears and runs out into the bushes to check for someone, clearly no one in their real mind would make you are in childcare, then the only thing I found wrong with the movie, and even then they probably had to put it there to build excitement, I will not give away too much to anyone who has not seen it, I recommend you Do instead of listening to all those people who say their shit and worse than the original, it would be a better movie for teens, as it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the movies, there were at least 10 adults over 70 and looked at it and they Enjoy it if they enjoyed it I think you want to! I give it a 9 out of 10!
