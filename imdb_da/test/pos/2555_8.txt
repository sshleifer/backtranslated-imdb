Chop Shop. Posted and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-driven naturalistic style film studies about the kind of small people passing by every day without anyone ever noticing that they are there in New York. <br /> <br /> It is people who have been pushed to the extreme edge of society. They exist in some sort of gray world, many of them immigrants whose legal status in America seems somewhat questionable. Where do they come from ? How did they get there? How do they manage? Where will they end? These are not feel good stories as such, but stories of survival at its most basic daily level. <br /> <br /> Ale is such a street kid. He has no education and hustler anyway, he can, to save money, nor is he turning to petty theft. Mostly, he is eager to reunite with his older sister. We see him in the early stages calling a safe house looking for her, but has no real success. A young friend, Carlos gets him a job in a beating shop in the shadow of Shea baseball stadium. Eventually, his older sister comes to live with him, but he is jealous of his friends' motives and suspicious of how she earns extra money. He dreams of buying a food van and setting up a sales company with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all his films on the spot. There is nothing blank or glossy over them. This is life, as these people will live it in the raw. It is not beautiful, even though it is never malevolent, and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film is the same as hanging over the everyday lives of these people. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural and the characters get plenty of space and space to work in. Polanco is great in the lead and Gonzalez provides solid support as the older sister.
