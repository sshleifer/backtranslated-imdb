This movie was Hilarious! It occasionally went too far, but isn't that what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and oooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts. It is rude, raw and sometimes frighteningly intense. The whole band is back and even more out of their minds, which in turn provides good entertainment. I don't want to give anything away, but the small clips of clips that go around the net are nothing compared to what comes after. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch with friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just don't go with someone who can't take it (see above). It's not going well, you can be sure of that. But it's pretty obvious in the first place. If you enjoy the first one, you will loooooove this one.
