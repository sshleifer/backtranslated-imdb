Our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the director with good performances by Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The Climax was built well, but to the end, which was far from being called "God". We still try to understand what the director was trying to convey? Were the short ideas or the end beyond the understanding of ordinary film lovers? A better end would have created a lasting impression on the audience and the increased viewership. However, this should not take away credit due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi to connect so well with the characters!
