I missed it at the cinema and rented it on DVD. If you get the chance, I'd recommend it as it's better than almost everything I've seen in the cinema or on DVd this year. That's not to say it's one of the best movies ever or anything, it's just I've seen a lot of rubbish :) <br /> <br /> Can't really add to what has already been said except 8.10
