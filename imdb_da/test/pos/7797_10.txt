This movie is a great comedy .. the script is too fun .. if you see it more than once, you'll enjoy it more. Although the comedy is sometimes stupid, but it really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given their roles justice. Since 1994, I have not come across any Hindi movies that were as fun as this.
