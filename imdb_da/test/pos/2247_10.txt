When I first saw this movie, I had thought it would be a horrible disturbance that was ruled by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and completely changed my mind. Based on the short story by Jonathan Safran Foer, everything is illuminated telling the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) trying to find the woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He travels to Germany and arrives in the aid of a 20-something, clubbing translator and his grandfather. This results in a stiff search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Shot in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, everything is enlightened delivering tensions between the translator and his grandfather and the help Jonathan must find his stone board. There is also much religious question that grandfather refers to Jonathan as "the Jew". All in all, it is a movie that deals with finding yourself and a loving family. I give this wonderful, if not enlightened, movie a 10 out of 10th Arjun
