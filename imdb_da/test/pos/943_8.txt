I can't see how a movie of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from the IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that looks like the latest endeavors like LOVE AND OTHER CASTLE, SUGAR, OCCASIONAL COARSE LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, TRIAL PEOPLE, THE SECRET LIFE IN THE USA, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, DUST FROM THE WINGS, TIME FOR PATSY CLINE, etc ... As a 19-year-old uni-student (Newton, perhaps his best role yet, like CHANGI at least) with a dull, over-religious mother, the shock of his life gets when she decides to sign up for the same course as him - and before you go thinking about another GOOFY MOVIE, it is not there any real substance here. Certainly it is a simplified notion of life in general and art students in particular (but then they are quite simplistic under all the philosophical mumbo-jumbo it is not?), And perhaps the study of Sinead Cusack's character is somewhat confused at times, but the film is light, fun and has some important messages. The principle is amazing: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (see her also in GODDESSEN 1967) is so undervalued, it's not fun. She is a beautiful, fresh and confident actor who deserves any recognition she receives. I gave MITT MOR FRANK 8/10.
