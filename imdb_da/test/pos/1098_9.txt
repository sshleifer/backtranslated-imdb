This was a random rental in the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd function by an engaging director. The film captures deeply obvious moments and several times often frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well-informed in their approach to the core material, and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is rich in images that provide a frame for frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. The musical score of the film adds the body to the film without being intrusive. After seeing it the second time, I tracked the DVD on Amazon and have been happy since.
