Make this card and to that point. This movie was amazing! I loved it! I actually downloaded this on a Hollywood video for 3 bucks on VHS and seen it about 5 times in the last couple of weeks. I'm a big Bogart fan and I just locked this movie. I thought the song was fun and now it has ringtone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls out a good Bogart. His nose is a bit big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward, but otherwise he was great, and this movie was wonderful. No one can be a perfect Bogart, but he was amazing. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and will not do everything he did. He mentions many other films and does some things that were never part of the real book's character. But it is so fun and fun and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. See it and have fun!
