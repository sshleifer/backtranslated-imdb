Right up, I love this movie. I love everything about it. It has a fantastic soundtrack, it has many recognizable faces, and it's fun as hell. There are so many plots in this movie, and each one is fun in some way. Where Spicolli lit the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable as a character. All he wants to do is have fun. He moves out of the house without his parent's consent, he jumps to work when he feels that he is obsessed with sex, he loves his drugs and booze and he tries to be a good friend. It is his lack of attitude that makes him a joy to see. And he comes out with some nice lines. And there are so many small observations that you can't see, but they make you laugh at the fast speed when it hits you. A certain moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's ex girlfriend who dies another now. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his big beer bottle and throws it over his shoulder relaxed. He says so good night and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. He really lives to party and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is over, and he doesn't care who he insults in the process. He is innocent of him. "It's relaxed" is his favorite word. <br /> <br /> Another such classic scene is Reggie, who delivers Bill a donut. He says something to him that I and my friends will never forget because we rewound the movie ten times and saw that part over and over and hurt ourselves laughing. It should be seen as appreciated. Wild Life is a throw back to when teenage comedies were fun, raunchy, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted to get lost in their world for 90 minutes. Wild Life makes all these things perfect. If this is a movie you haven't seen, give it a try. It's a classic. <br /> <br /> Also check out the army store guy that Jim is having trouble with. He is a well-known face now, and it is his first role on the big screen.
