It is important to realize that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist film producer who held some very specific and specific theories on what movies could achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Comparing Alexander Nevsky negatively with everything from a similar period in the United States, this movie is simply inexperienced, this film comes from the world's oldest film school from another continent, from a completely different approach to the cinema. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this movie a little more, try to find out about Pudovkin's and Kuleshov's theories of montage, for example, or read the Wikipedia entry on Marxist film theory. If you feel really brave, you can even examine the triadic forms of hegelic dialectics. It follows that if you see this movie without any understanding of Eisenstone's ideas and ideals, you probably won't. In Alexander Nevsky, the protagonists do not play themselves, but they are meant to be distillations of their nation's character. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown greater than life, because they represent stylized, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. The action is not wood, it is supposed to be a bit repetitive. It represents a completely different school than the more naturalistic, narrative style that Hollywood quickly adopted. Eisenstein's films are especially designed * not * to be realistic. If something seems to be "obvious," whether lighting or language or a posture hit by an actor is supposed to be that way. Eisenstein was one of the early advocates of film as an art form, not just as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if editing seems to consist of a clash of images, that is the idea. Plays are meant to be in contrast with each other, Eisenstone's film contains and highlights elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely Marxist dialectics. <br /> <br /> So sit back, shout hurray for Russia and her people's defenders, boo with the celebrated nobles and the Teuton invaders, and enjoy the difference.
