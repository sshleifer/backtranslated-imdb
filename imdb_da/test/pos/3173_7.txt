I am surprised that all the reviews I have looked at, no one seems to have noticed one of the main points of this movie, or at least how I saw it. It seems to be a great gay fantasy, camp clothes, a glorious nude Ferdinand, a certain sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and as a final climax, a group of men in close nail suits dancing the horn pipe. This whole approach, when you get used to it, gives you all sorts of amazing scenes and pictures. The sight of an innocent Ariel was drawn to a disgusting naked Sycorax to perform "her earthly and abominable commands", one of the darkest I have ever stage in a Shakespeare movie. But at the end of the movie I got tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much to take. Yet it is an interesting interpretation of the game.
