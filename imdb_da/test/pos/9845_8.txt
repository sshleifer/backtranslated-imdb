This is a typical fast-moving entertaining movie from the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney in the lead, these "pre-code" movies are even better: just fun things to look at. Usually, when movies are "dated", it is a negative but not so with movies from 1930-1934. Yes, with snake and attitudes, dress, hairstyles etc. Are they dated, but that's a big part of the fun. These movies have an edge for those who are almost always funny to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a corniness that is appealing and fascinating. You see people - like the young offenses depicted in this movie and their heavy parents - that you don't see for some time, but this (early 30s). Early on this movie, the children go before the judge, and you just sit and laugh at these crazy characters appearing in court on behalf of their children, one after another. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father; the Jewish father the Anglo-Saxon mother and a couple of other mothers who all in dramatic form tend to be "a good boy". Although things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone in here is so funny to see. <br /> <br /> This also teaches you that the kids were punctured 75 years ago, also stealing, robbing, mugging, lying - hi, that's the human condition. This movie debunker the theory that "people were nicer back in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we get a lot of "Dead End" children who finish in Reform School. The ridiculous and stupid liberal story has children who appear immediately as angels as they run the show at the reform school; not punished at least to make a man fall to his death and set fire to the institution (explanation: he was a meanie and deserved it. So much for real justice and reform.); and "Patsy" shoots some guy never need to be questioned by the police because he is the good guy! Notice the subtle anti-religious tomb where the only guy who looks to pray is the evil "warden". It's not accidental, no accident. This kind of negative association thing has been going on ever since the Hays code was canned in the late 60s and was seen as you see in the Pre-Code early in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digger, by the way, is excellent in his "bad guy" role "Mr. Thomson." I was especially his voice very effective and could make him play one of the similarly vicious roles as an institutional director in a Charles Dickens movie adaptation. Cagney played his normal role, the poor guy who takes the no-go that gets the beautiful girl, "Dorothy Griffith", played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Just looking at Darro's face alone made his character credible. Some things he was the real star of the movie, but I still want to go with Cagney. The rest of the schoolchildren were not too credible, and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to see. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes when we saw how badly these children were and experienced the good and bad and stereotypical parents in court after the children were arrested. These scenes are pure 1930s Dead End Kids stuff. They always showed the kids to be bad news at the start of the movie, but when the story was over, they all looked more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly "overdue". It is very removed, but it works, entertainingly. <br /> <br /> All in all, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of Cagney movies and the early 30s. Almost everyone estimates at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
