A gritty Australian movie with all elements to success. Two hands represent the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce top quality popular material. The film has a fresh angle and contains unique drama, excitement and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable at so many levels - but can also appreciate that it may not be everyone's cup. The film carries a distinct Aussie humor as it portrays Sydney's cool underworld and explores the life of a young man (Ledger) and a young woman (Byrne) swept up in the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two hands deal with the theme of good and evil both on an interpersonal and personal level and look at the issue of consequences for 'our' actions. <br /> <br /> Camera work is snazzy and the dialogue is humorous. With Bryan Brown playing Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy, it fights on the screen in the most bizarre situations - this Aussie movie is definitely not short of actors. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become something of a cult favor and one of mine as well.
