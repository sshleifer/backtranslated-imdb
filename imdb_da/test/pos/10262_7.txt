Shameless Screen Entertainment is a fairly new and British (I think) DVD label that specializes in smutty and excessive violent cult movies ?? mainly Italian - from the glorious times when everything was possible, from the late 60s to the mid-80s. The brand's choice seems like a crossover between oeuvres of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they have probably borrowed the name of the latter) and they have already released some really rare sick Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer", " Killer Nun, "Phantom of Death" and "Torso". "The Scared Woman" was completely unknown to me, but since my colleagues' reviewers from here whose opinions I consider tremendously described it as one of the greatest and most fascinating psychedelic euro-sex exploitation films of his time, I did not hesitate to pick it up. This is a very strange movie and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loved audience. However, if you are part of the remaining 1%, you are capable of a truly unique treat. Style, atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs", but they are both widely regarded as classics, while "The Scared Woman" is almost unknown. It's just about profiling and good marketing, I think. The story is about a literally dirty rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns several old-fashioned cars and has a very impressive collection of artistic relics, including a lifestyle mannequin doll replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly upbeat attitude to women. He regards them as a threat to men's survival and thus uses his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abused, randomly he picks up from the street. Dr. Sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely crushing her female spirit, but he slowly falls to her. Just he begins to believe in the actual love she returns with revenge. This really is not for everyone, but if you appreciate mood and spooky sexy ambiances, bizarre natural toys and psychedelic handshakes that seem absolutely incredible and surreal, consider this top recommendation. It's slow, stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers ?? Shameless entertainment, okay!
