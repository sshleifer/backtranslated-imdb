Well, I disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated card. He loves it and claimed it was fun. I enjoyed it, but saw no humor. He doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it, and still loved the story. Live just across the border from Canada, I've seen hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalo .... but I didn't think much about this cartoon. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if you had a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area - disaster! This is especially true in the Les-Canadian year of glory. However, it does not make the story fun. <br /> <br /> Back in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces killed the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, it has the Toronto Maple Leaf emblem on it, so the child does not want to be caught dead wearing it. When he finally does and heads for the local rink, he gets the rest of his hockey friends. What's so funny about it? I could see the same thing happening to a child in Boston who is Red Sox die-hard and his mother gets him the Yankees shirt! Horrors! You couldn't carry it and vice versa. Perhaps for someone who doesn't follow sports at all, like Maltin, this situation seems strange and humorous to him ... but it's a fact of life or any sports fans and his favorite team. It was an interesting story and completely credible, but nothing that made me laugh. The art was fun to watch all over, almost like looking at a large number of crayons of a talented schoolchild. The French Canadian accent was also good. This movie was part of the DVD "Leonard Malta's animation favorites from the National Film Board of Canada.
