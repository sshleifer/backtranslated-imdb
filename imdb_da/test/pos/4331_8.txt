"Death Wish 3" brings Charles Bronson back as once vigilante Paul Kersey, now retired.yeah, right.be too long, Kersey is back in his old ways. But this time it's not just a few muggers at a time, it's a gang who has taken over a worn-out part of the city (New York again, by the way.) This time his war saw Kersy Hauls out the big guns (literally) this. The body counts int his one rivals something Stallone or Schwarzenegger has come up with. This movie is actually fun to watch, especially for a few lines and of course bad boys or being seriously hurt in creative ways, which is always a good thing. The violence is not so personal in this one, it is, of course, on a much larger scale, like bombing your victims far away, rather than one on a fight. This movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2, making it easier to see. There is not much import to this movie, it's more escapism than anything. It is also cheesy at times and pseudo-inspiring, but snake scenes fall flat. they should have left the original "Death Wish" on their own without successors, but since they did not, they should have stopped here. 8.10
