After watching this movie, I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250, but in its genre it's a good movie. I know not many people find it fun to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' turns into a comedy. Many still seem to believe that some things should not laugh at ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I've also seen the original Robin Hood movies, but I've never had such good time watching them as I had with this one. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies of famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). I recommend anyone who wants a good laugh to watch this movie. For those who think that Robin Hood shouldn't be messed with, you're wrong, but you'd better not see it because you're likely to be offended by it. I give this movie an 8/10.
