When I went to the video rental store, I had seen all the movies in the store that I was interested in as they were still unknown to me. Ie I thought! The man behind the counter told me that he had something for me that I absolutely wish for. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". First, I doubted that it was good, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure I'm glad I took this jewel together! This is one of the best adventure movies this year if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as a big part, how bad can a movie get? Surely Liv Tyler does what she is good at and not much more: be beautiful. But you can still very much notice that the player apparently had a lot of fun and made this movie.
