Definitely not a movie to revolutionize the industry or introduce new techniques for film making, it is a very nice and solid production. It is miraculous that today we can enjoy it in excellent quality on DVD - probably most of the viewers about 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the stencil-tinted de luxe edition was only available at the very best theaters. Although you are not fascinated by this movie or the subject of it, you cannot do without the copy released by Image Entertainment (along with another gem, from manger to cross, 1912). It's almost impossible to see a movie that is over a century old, but shows so little damage. The stencil dyeing process was a very effective one, and in comparison with the occasionally blurred and discarded images of hand-dyed films, the colors are sharp and well-defined. Filmed within the framework of the film production as known back in 1902, when the film began, the scenes of the scenes today can be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The tablets still move on a stable paste, so the film never gets boring. You can't be fascinated by this movie as a film work, but it's certainly beautiful as a work of academic, quaint art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you look anonymous, since removing people who played long ago departing characters, adds the mystery significantly. A proper view for Christmas or borrowed. <br /> <br /> PS: I have the tick box "contains spoilers" just for fun. As you can see, I haven't revealed the end.
