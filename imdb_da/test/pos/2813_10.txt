When I saw the example of this movie, I thought to myself, "Here is another silly TV movie written with a soap opera's thought and complexity," but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and shows she can actually act if she gets the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close), but begins to lose confidence in him when one series of rapes begin to take place in its community. First, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him, but as time goes on, she continues to be suspicious of him. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds like the setup for another boring melodramatic TV movie, it really is much better than that because the characters are well-executed by Thiessen and Close, and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than one would expect; Not only caricatures or cardboard characters exist only to move the plot together but real, three-dimensional people, and we find ourselves caring about them. And the movie is smart enough to give an exciting climax to the story without resorting to stupid action scenes, mindless cliches or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the main character's inner conflicts and fears and get a realistic portrayal of how she might solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to give this a look, please. It is the production values ​​not exactly in the top class (it is a TV movie), but if you can see it, there is an excellent story to enjoy.
