I have accidentally happened to this show and was surprised to find that no one I know has ever heard of it. This was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months, if not years, and I can't wait for more episodes to come out. Sleeper Cell depicts a psychological struggle for an undercover agent inside a terrorist cell who must make tough decisions all the time to maintain its coverage while adhering to its real cause. This is a very well done show. It keeps you fascinated from the first episode to the end, and even though it is slow, it is fast enough to feel on the edge. Quite realistic and humane, it touches on important issues, and each episode presents an interesting issue to consider. This show is not 24 or any of the police shows on television nor is trying to be anything. It is genuine and unique. It is a show about a human, his difficult choices and his struggle life, where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 10 to great story, good progression, excellent filmography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.
