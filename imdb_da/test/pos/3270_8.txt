Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gets a simple job of Pando (Bryan Brown) an underground kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door, Jimmy decides to take a dip on the beach to pass some time, but he notes that his clothes on the sand have been destroyed and the 10 grand are gone. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him the problem, but he won't hear it. Pando and his boys are trying their best to find Jimmy, which means no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him. So now Jimmy is hiding to organize a bank robbery to get Panda's money back. Also during this mess he meets the innocent sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they enter a hell of a trip through Sydney's King Cross. <br /> <br /> "To Hands" is simply an exciting pick-me-up movie that is lively, exciting and incredibly fresh. What you have here is basically an urban gangster movie with a seedy background and in your face violence ?? what, how fresh are you asking? Well, because it takes us into the underworld where the Australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs (flip flops) and footy shorts, made up cars and a can of beer in hand ?? And don't forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that it owes much to "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" and "Lock, Warehouse and Two Smoking Barrels" for inspiration, but for me it still stands for itself. The film has a real blend of light hearted moments, but also a significant touch to it with some unexpected shock and black humor that can actually disturb. You just don't know what's coming and it has a good touch of snappy irony (especially the ending) and good timing with his humor. A scene with bank robbery will get you stitched, I guarantee you. The plot's outline is really a coming to age story (or about the road not taken), with a pausing love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it. Most of the subplots were wisely constructed and locked together, but perhaps it could have gone without the supernatural element that involved Jimmy's death brother, but in the overall context, the different plot seems to all click together. Intense, natural and sharp dialogue filled the monstrous colorful script, with fast jabs of Aussie slang / twang - I'm good dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the movie was that of Bryan Brown's performance of Pando. He just gave his character such an incredibly charismatic / eerie persona that when he was not on the screen, his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides - one is a dot, but the other side is such a good crack. A young Rose Byrne shines with his nervously sweet / quirky character Alex. She looked radially beautiful and added a bubbly personality. Then you got Heath Ledger, which fits the money like the naive Jimmy. Large supportive cast involved with eg. Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. Such crude performances are achieved, and from there, you get riveting, fun and credible characters. Pumping rock soundtrack bursts with seams like Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd gives a cool mood. Also shot on the spot in Sydney's King Cross really helped keep going by keeping a life in itself and showing the Australian lifestyle. Sliding camera tricks captured the city's backdrop excellent, especially the piercing nightlife. This was a movie that when I finished, I was completely satisfied with what I got. All in all, a smooth paced crime thriller that achieves what it should do ... a fun, smart and crazy rollercoaster ride of excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say it's a successful Aussie take on "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" by director / author Gregor Jordan in his debut movie. If you encounter it, don't hesitate to give it a try.
