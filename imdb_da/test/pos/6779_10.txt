The game was made in 1996, but it is still good today. the graphics are not so hot, and the actors are not oscar-worthy, but the plot is twisted, diabolical and very comfortable. The dark story is convincing from the first movie and continues throughout the game. We played several people together for several reasons: 1) to use all our minds together. 2) Not to be so scared. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret this, just try not to find a scary engine in there.
