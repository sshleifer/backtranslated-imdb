This wonderful movie is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. Yet they can be big and worthy of the pain and suffering of the break. <br /> <br /> Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us an insight into the period around 1900, how society (mis) deals with women and how a very strong woman (Nynke) deals with. With great costumes, landscapes, great music and good actors and appearing in this photo play, you draw in the length of the movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, the end is a bit sudden, a page describing the rest of her life scrolls. On reflection, this is a fantastic (the best) way to get your own imagination to create the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> This was the second movie for me that had people while the final titles rolled off (The first is Schindler's list). Apparently the film had this effect at all.
