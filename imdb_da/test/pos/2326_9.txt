"Down Periscope" has been in our library since the first arrived at VHS. Since then we have purchased the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It's a nice flick that doesn't go military overboard like either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy, and as a means to the protagonists, I am quite surprised that a successor has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The film has a sequel that borders on a cult occupation, even among the very young. I was aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile in Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken the role of the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board. /> <br /> It's a fun romp that makes you proud of both our fleet and Hollywood ... which is rarely company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!
