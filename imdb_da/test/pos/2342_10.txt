I saw One Life Stand when it was premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very European movie and brilliantly succeeds in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it is in the indie tradition - deals with complex problems, but moves and is alleviated by touches of discreet humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other British realistic films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comic stereotypes. The performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand the movie has recently been released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas puts his heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing performance.
