Seeing "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days in a suicide <br /> <br /> look, disorienting but strangely stimulating. There are few biographical equivalents to this disturbing yet humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surreal ideology. <br /> <br /> Experimental works of Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" and Maya Ders bring a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed. A close comparison is the dark adult adventures of literary genius writer Angela Carter, the brief disturbing stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements in the <br /> <br /> past but shows a truly unique and original story. <br /> <br /> As a story, DEATH BED is an amazingly simple yet original <br /> <br /> vision that only one-in-a-thousand independent releases succeed. This indescribable movie has its technical flaws, but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non-actors <br /> <br /> and lost scary places - a true 1970s independent classic. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also shows a unique, subversive, three-dimensional personality - a deep and sustained storage of dream images and ideas that make it a "fun-house" type of construction. Time of day told in backlinks and historical time travel, the bed with its eerie black humor, the rich yet discreet symbolism used within its imagery. Most gratifying is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, forever trapped within the framework of his own painting, which he comments and hugs with the murdered victim "gift offering" gifted to him as a love offering by the spirit of the demented bed. - A sick refrain and wonderful element / metaphor for the "captured artist" - Nothing but the strangest thing in POE or MALLARME can match that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates the spirit of the independent cinema and wants the multi-layered symbolic experience, or wants the surreal concept of "hugging <br /> <br /> beauty" and the gothic scarecrows of low budget utilization film production will Dig this completely unique vision. A simple and fun movie with delicious deep psychic undercurrents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
