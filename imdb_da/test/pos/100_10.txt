The finest card I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it may have been extended due to the weight of insight it provides. There is irony in the commentary and little profit. The action is entirely up to Noonan, and he carries his unreliable character perfectly. I may have preferred the narrator to be less "recognizable", but the gravitas loan is perfect. This is a map for people who read for those whose "bar" is loud and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can create smart and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I was delighted with the Picasso reference when I once thought Picasso was just another little talent of art; as I assume most - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12. Picasso was a finer mayor and a brilliant artist of the age than many artists will ever live. I immediately understood why he had to make the art he became known for.
