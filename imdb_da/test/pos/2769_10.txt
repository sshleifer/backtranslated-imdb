I love this movie. and the Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can register it !!! but if not anyone knows where to find it ?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where to find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve to see it too. All these Disney movies coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and had great actors, and I can't see why it was taken out of the air. If everyone loves this movie so much why it was taken out of the air. Please take my comment into consideration and along with all the other comments on this movie. Thanks, have a good day.
