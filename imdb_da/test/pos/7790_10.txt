Good to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy film maker, and it is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece. This movie is really fun. Nice bit, exaggerated in a few scenes, but still the dialogues are really laughable and characters are really full of fun. History line in simple a billionaire's daughter comes to India for marriage and two young chaps are behind her, the story also has a twist with a gangster connection. as an innocent stupid to perfection.Raveena has done fine, but Karshima gets really annoying in some sequences. But real show steals are Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, they go into the frame and automatically start laughing. Overall such an enjoyable movie as you can see it no. of times without getting bored.
