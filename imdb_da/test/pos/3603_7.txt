Exactly how director John Madden joins Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz, who play an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorable story: "Captain Correli's Mandolin" escapes me! Witness: A wobbly, inconsistent accent of Cage among horrible overtones, with Cruz - more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite Johnny Depp in "Blow" - basically a repetitive performance under the guise of a Greek nurse ... yes it was painful . But there were scared gracers. The story itself is exciting for tragic, and Cage has some (- redeeming, this is!) Musical abilities. Next is a fantastic performance by John Hurt (Cruz's father, village doctor) by Oscar Callibre and Irene Papas, each as the village's elders, as well as by Christian Bale (Papas'son) among the village's freedom fighters, go a long way toward counterbalancing awkward performances (especially in the beginning) of Cruz and Cage. Nicely, the last two appear to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it's teeth gnashing early. Finally, nature itself and photography could achieve a technical price, and it provides comfortable distractions when needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as a doctor makes this movie worth seeing. The true test of a supportive actor / actress is whether the movie would be the same without that character, and in this case it would certainly not be ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value, but for the above plus factors that help raise the line. See it if you don't. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
