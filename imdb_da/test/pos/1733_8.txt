As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr. Who and although I had heard about the series in passing, I never really understood what it was. It was so hesitant that I sat down to see the ninth doctor and his antics were told he was something like Arthur Dent (from Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've missed, seriously, why hadn't anyone told me this before? My entire childhood was deprived of Doctor Who Adventures; I am a huge fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes. I must admit that I was not so sure at first that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I am happy to say that she did very well, I thought, adding a very realistic touch to the series. In fact, I think it was one of my favorite aspects of the series; The contrast between large alien conflict scenes as opposed to the annoying normality of the South London Council Estate life. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it can fit into their worldly life. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I haven't seen many of his films, and I've never seen another actor like Dr Who, but I thought his depiction of the doctor was brilliant, extremely sympathetic, yet dark enough to make you wonder. I find that many other characters with their kind of story history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they all have the right feelings and actions, but they always seem a little shallow. This doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other remarks that a higher budget for the special effects, foreigners and whatnot could have been a bit more efficient. but then again it is not about special effects (though they help) from what I have read and heard from a long time, Dr. Who fans; It is the spirit of all things that really counts. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I liked all foreigners, but my favorite had to be Daleks; if i ever knew anything about dr. Who before I saw the series was that there were things in it that looked like upward dust boxes on wheels. Earlier to see, I was quite skeptical about these peppers threatening human existence, but some of them were quite scary! As I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great show. I look forward to future episodes of joy. The doctor has a new fan.
