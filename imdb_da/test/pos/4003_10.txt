I know that many people have said, do not break with this movie because it is not a good fight with flick and hard with the subtitles. It's a really lazy way of thinking about a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie, find something else, and also learn to respect the cinema as an art form, that is a masterful piece of work. If you want to see this, it's not really about fighting. There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed quite well with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fighting, and the combination of the two makes an excellent movie that is worth watching and is even better in the original language with subtitles.
