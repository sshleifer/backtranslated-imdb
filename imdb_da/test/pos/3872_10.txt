by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who originates as Reggie, fights with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, a cold spider recently released from prison, helps Reggie find out who killed his father. One week after his father died, a preacher, honorary packer, came up dead. Reggie was the one who killed him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it a kind of setup? Back in the day also has a couple of romantic scenes. See, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter, and J-Bone doesn't approve of her love prison. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. But what does J-leg do? Does Reggie and his girlfriend break up or do they bring them closer together? I like this movie because it leaves you wondering what to do next and did it or what happened. I like movies with excitement! It kind of makes you want to be in the movie so you could record things. I also like this movie because everything is in place if you really watch it!
