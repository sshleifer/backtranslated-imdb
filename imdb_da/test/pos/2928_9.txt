La Petit Tourette is a beautiful fun South Park episode. Cartman is on the toy store one day, and here is a kid gang loud, but not in trouble for it. Her mother tells everyone that the child has "tourette syndrome". Cartman loves the fact that he can swear without getting into trouble, so he tells everyone he has tourette syndrome. However, Kyle finds out that Cartman is lying and trying to tell people, but they think he is insensitive and put into a "Tourette's sensitivity training" type of place. He finds that he cannot control his tourettes and begins to say embarrassing things that happen to him. However, Kyle tries to sabotage the show in an interesting way.
