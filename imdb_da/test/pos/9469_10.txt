I thought this movie was fun. I already knew it would be a fun movie, but it was more fun than I expected. Sure there were some lame jokes, but they blew me up. I thought the actors were going to be pretty bad, but the actors were good at acting out of this comedy. I have to give Kudos to Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and drew a great performance like a boy. For the other actors, they were also fun. Of course, there were moments when you shout at the screen "how can you not tell it?", But it is quite part of the fun. In the end, the plot showed quite well. There is a happy end, but what do you expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, just fun.
