Over the many years, there are some movies that just slip off and hardly any views. <br /> <br /> Select Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little gem played at some festivals and had a short 2-week run in a small theater in West Hollywood that made it all around $ 5500. <br /> <br /> It's now on DVD I hope many more will now see this. <br /> <br /> It's a weird drama of a sharp young politician that affects a very bright 15 year old boy. This policy also has a beautiful nephew (about 17 years old) who is friendly with the 15 year old boy. The above section is a bit vague, what happens, so is the movie, & that's what I appreciated, we don't get all the facts, much is back to our own thinking. You will hear dialogue that makes this logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is a little vague, it's another point for the public to consider. <br /> <br /> Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old. He was about 17 when they made this movie, but can easily pass for younger ones. He has been in movies and television since he was a young child, he is a very good actor and is absolutely convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is the older teen, this role is his first big part and he is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I save the best at last, the author / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a great thumb arises. I hope he and our 2 lads have a long career. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
