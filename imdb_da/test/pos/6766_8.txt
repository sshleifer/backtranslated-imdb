This movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally fulfilled that dream, they faced a new problem: there were no clients! One day a guy dies accidentally in the refrigerator room, and a new kind of slaughterhouse begins? They start selling human flesh and say to the customers, it's just chicken ?? and their business is starting to improve: Human meat sells well! Oh! I forgot to say something ?? These guys are not normal! There is really something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> The movie has some fine dark humor scenes, but in my opinion it is mostly a drama. One who shows us what is within the psychopath's head, what is his motivation for what he does. I have to admit that I was a little surprised at the end of the movie because I never expected them to do it without being discovered, but that's probably because I'm watching too many Hollywood movies? What I mean by this is that in Hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the boys who do the "bad things". There is always a morality that protects the "good values" despite the fact that we all know that in "real life" does not happen so many times? And I liked this movie, mostly because of it, because it fits into a kind of cinema that is true, frontal, without false morals, and that "see" what is on the other hand behind the "conventional morality "?? It just happens in independent cinema (especially in European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) in the "disturbed guys" roles? <br /> <br /> Very nice Danish movie!
