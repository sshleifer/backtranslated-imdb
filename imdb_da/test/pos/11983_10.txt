I went to watch this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a rather small portion, so it was good that I liked the movie on my own. In fact, I liked it! <br /> <br /> The film centers around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, retired kind, and Louie ... Now Louie isn't. The story is about Louie's request to Albert to let him come over to Albert's place for just a moment. Louie just got out of prison. Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course when they do something together, there are problems, and it is Albert who always takes the fall. <br /> <br /> The film's action is based on the adventures of Louie's visit. On the run is a chronicle of bile-cap, zany, situations. But Bruno de Almeida and scriptwriter Joseph Minion (After Hours) do not always take you where you expect to go. There are twists that add depth to this movie. Of course, there is plenty of direct comedy, but there is also very subtle humor here. <br /> <br /> There are also some good performances here. Albert plays nice by Michael Imperioli. He gets pretty well known these days from the HBO series, The Sopranos. Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who imbues his character with a lovable, childish quality. (Whatever he does, just love Louie!). Both of these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli you will hug him and bring him home to mother. Ventimiglia, you do not know whether to slam him or bring him home (and not to mother!). <P> <br /> There are also other stand-out performances. Rita's character is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience offered her. Talking to the others who saw the movie, it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who were their favorite of the two. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can't say that. There were many times I wanted the director to have had a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes crying out for more budget freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with, and I think you'll see a movie that makes you stand up and notice.) The end sequence was a bit of a budget victim. Anyway, budget or no budget, the screen shot, in my opinion, joined the talent of actor and instructor into a memorable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
