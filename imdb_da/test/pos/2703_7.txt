Yes, this is one of the better-made television films, and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I had to sing all their material in elementary school and in the middle school choir, and I had to do much of the solo material that Karen sang leading. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers in the 70's - and being a kid / teenager singing these songs and learning music - the only thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never came, she died three weeks before it had to happen. And yes, it seemed to me, because I didn't know anything about anorexia - and couldn't understand completely what happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was produced, I got a good understanding. Perhaps not everything in Karen and Riker's life is open to the television audience, but in the opening of the parts that were shown, I understood a lot from the music industry at that time. What disturbs me is that I write "of the time" and see "now". No one has learned a darned thing, although this was a very informative and welcoming look at a family's problems in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These movies are not ready for fun, they are ready to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman who was captured throughout the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine. Didn't know. She got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved, and the music industry that cared more about her appearance / weight than the talent inside. With the start of MTV it got worse. With 'American Idol' it is like a plaster attachment in an English accent. A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure someone can give it a HBO treatment, but somehow, many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.
