I have always loved French movies because I think they are filled with much more feeling and feeling than the Americans. This movie is a gem. Begins with the wedding, which is so fun that you just want to be with and finally where the small family children tell us who is with who is extremely fun. Catherine Deneuve is simply warm and so good that it is quite possible that a young man may fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where Antoine has become angry and shouts his feelings to Lea in front of the family. It's such a shame that I could only buy this movie from French and not from English (so I have to learn French to enjoy watching it) !!
