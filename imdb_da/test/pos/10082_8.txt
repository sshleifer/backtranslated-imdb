I've seen this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in its unprocessed version, which is the softcore pornography, is the best and second time in a trimmed stroke (cut across sex and most of the nudity) that was entertaining in a typical beach movie scene. The unknown version has a fantastic sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a guy and a bottle of oil out of this world (no saying is calculated). Unfortunately, that scene is almost carved in the trimmed version, just like any other sex scene. Judged or Undetermined, it is still fun to see all the siblings of larger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc;) trying to act. We also get performances by B-Queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
