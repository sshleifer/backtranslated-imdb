Fado is a sad almost bluesy style of Portuguese Gypsy music that is heard repeatedly through the movie. As explained by one of the protagonists (Igor) it also means fate. In fact, it is fate that brings the two main characters Paco and Alex together and triggers the problems that arise. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it all a bit. It starts out as a "downs and downs" drama / road movie that builds on an exciting thriller / road movie. <br /> <br /> There were two things that I found unrealistic that kept me out of give it a higher rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the most important point why Alex gave away things. She was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport to a bad sum and then she gives away things Well worth thousands to a stranger, her explanation was convincing, how did they get through the gate, where was the police?
