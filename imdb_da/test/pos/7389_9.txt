I saw Dark Harbor at the '98 Seattle Film Festival. Filmed against an outdated Maine background, this movie boasts an excellent cast and plot that keeps you guessing all the way through. At times terrible, sometimes funny, I have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful as the icy marriages and Reedus are someone you want to hear more from, I'm sure. The opening shot on a winding, abandoned road in a torrential rain at dusk (and the score that came with it) set the tone so well - just amazing. Nice, nice work from a new-ish instructor / screenwriter and his talented crew.
