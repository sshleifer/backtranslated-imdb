If you took a really good jack black movie, you added a bit of jeepers creepers and saw a touch of joyride with a touch of Texas chainsaw massacre and house of 1000 corpses ... you would have MONSTER MAN! I went into this movie, not expecting much at all, but I really cease enjoying the movie. The whole premise is really cheesy, a monster man in a monster truck chases down people, but it's so funny that the author / instructor doesn't expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comical gem and should have a very promising career. He is identical to Jack Black. The only problem with the movie is the incredible hero-role played by Eric Jungmann. But in general, if you are looking for a really fun movie that will crack you until you roll in the hallways, while scaring the crap out of you ... check out this movie.
