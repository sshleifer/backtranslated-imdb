Inside Spoilers <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's movie adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel is visual if it is not philosophically true to its source (the British opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian / Dionysian struggles consuming the aging author) . It is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of history. Never has Venice looked more beautiful and prolonged, more decadent and effete. If you've read the novella, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an excellent performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he conveys bitterness, aroused passion, and finally an adorable longing of Aschenbach alone through facial expressions. Bj√∏rn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's wish, was perfectly cast. He also plays the part with facial expressions and movements. The Tadzio character is crucial to history, so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti, with her incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And changing Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler, then using Mahler's music, especially the 5-Symphony Adagiette, was another brilliant stroke. Although I wanted to read the Mann story before the movie, Mahler's music and death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. Like the scary images that appear throughout the film, especially that the last of Ashenbach dies on the beach, as Tadzio slowly enters the ocean. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will be released in DVD widescreen format and its visual splendor completely restored to us.
