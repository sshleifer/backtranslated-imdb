With the obvious exception for Fools & Horses, this, in my opinion, was David Jason's finest series. Just after his television debut on 'Do not Adjust Your Set!', These 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days. In comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and the horrible series 'Lucky Man' did not come close. <br /> <br /> I think Jason has forbidden the series to be repeated because it showed him his rawest. Shame on him. A new generation deserves to enjoy this. The series actually flopped in the ratings, but that's probably because it was against "The Brothers" being broadcast on the BBC at the same time before video recorders were common. I just noticed BTW. that his long-standing assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley off Coronation Street. I'm amazed that he didn't try to kill Edgar Briggs !!!!
