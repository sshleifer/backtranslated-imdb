I find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the history of the A-bomb and it has been developed for decades after the Manhattan project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industry (in the 1950s to the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and associated national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was a film in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about colleague Paul Tibbits, who flew Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. One could look at a side street (USS-Indian police descending shortly after the bomb delivery to Tinian) in Robert Shaw's description of the shark attacks on the survivors of JAWS. But the real trials of Groves, Oppenheimers and their teams were not considered film-impaired. <br /> <br /> Then in 1989 two films appeared. I have reviewed one already (DAG ONE), which I think is better of the two in discussing the long technical and emotional and political issues in the Manhattan project. The act of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was first rate and nicely balanced. Small page vignettes about Szilard's anti-bomb crusade (Michael Tucker) help fill out the story well. <br /> <br /> That's the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (like Mr. Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in a different way that while not terribly smaller than Dithys intelligent but soft spoken military brass. Newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of weapons as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after school yard. Yes it was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy does not remember the great toys of the future, but on the store to create the big toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's performance as Oppeheimer helps maintain the film's fundamentally interesting and good production, aided by Bonnie Bedelia as her wife. But the most interesting aspect of this movie is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, especially the latter in the character of John Cusacks Merriman. Inevitably, in all technological advances, people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought the dangers of the new liberated power, even in a so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. The two tragedies (especially Louis Slotin's slow, disturbing death by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed by using nuclear power - and how the chances of chances could still cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and manuscript) and the actual incident with Slotin was that Slotin actually took some time after the accident to find out where all his fellow researchers were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident (he could show that he only got the full effect of the accidental explosion, so it was only relatively minor treatment needed by the others). Perhaps the full story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the humane pain he ultimately suffered, he took time to think of the others showing what a first-class person he really was.
