My husband dragged me to this movie as I had no interest in seeing some animated cartoons. I was absolutely delighted with the simple story and amazing animation. In a digital world where effects are computer-generated, it was refreshing to see beautiful, imaginative hand-drawn animations. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a living fantasy land mixed with minimal reality. I haven't seen animation like this since I was a kid, and it's great to see it endure and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors who delivered the votes in the English version were amazing. The length of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to be squirrels in movies. Overall a lovely experience worth the very expensive fares we have today.
