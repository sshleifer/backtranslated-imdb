This movie won't win any awards for greatness. But if you have an hour and a half and feel like a little glowing entertainment, then you can do much worse than seeing this ... <br /> <br /> Throwing is mostly young and beautiful, the script has some real Funny moments and the soundtrack are also pretty cool. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have the most fun while Laura Fraser like Justine is sweet, sympathetic and fun. <br /> <br /> I rented it because I like the 'Spooks' series that RPJ is currently starring in. And here he is young and puffy and the perfect eye light for a girls evening. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and some ice cream and get a chuckle.
