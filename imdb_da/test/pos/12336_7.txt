I didn't know anything about this movie until I saw it. It seems to be a lesser known teen horror from the 80s. What struck me was how it happened from so many other films from that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was how slow this movie builds. It does not make the typical setup of displaying characters murdered one by one. It takes time to build the back story and leave a little mystery about what can happen. I almost began to believe that no one would be bad in this movie. But everything leads to the climate sequence over the last 15 minutes, and then it becomes quite graphic (it was a bad time to take a snack break - I could barely finish my pizza when it started). <br /> <br /> The signs also seem a little more three-dimensional than many of the cheap teen scare flicks. There conversations were refreshing on the head, mostly, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you would expect. For example, the girl who is the popular, snob, queen beer of the click, is not constantly splashing insults at all, but can doubt and show little consideration to others. So, in summary, I felt that this movie was something original compared to what I had expected and a little better done too. It took me in, kept me interested, and let me get it. As I said, it is pretty gory during the finals, but almost family-friendly much of the rest of the time. I don't have to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
