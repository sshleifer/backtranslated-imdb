I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just saying what's coming to mind. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed and it was not bitter laughter. it was not cynical laughter. It was the laughter that was generated by true joy. <br /> <br /> pleasure. It is a foreign word for me. I don't feel the word often, but I did while I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Want. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a good person. "Smile on my face and there is a glimpse in my eye." The line in one of Will's songs describes him perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a lucky, lucky boy to have a father like Will. Jada is a lucky, lucky woman to have a man like Will. He's someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I actually feel happy. It is a strange feeling. I don't feel very often. It's just so nice to see, to see ... other people really happy. I mean really happy. In this movie I did it. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with just" fine ", maybe I'll have" extraordinary. "You know watching this movie made me think: I do too. <br /> <br /> Be yourself We all know that we must be ourselves, but it feels like we are being punished if we do, maybe it should be deserved, maybe it is something we show after being ourselves For a long time, I just loved the end, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann Emery all dancing at the wedding. Dancing without inhibitions. NO WE ARE NOT DRUNK! understand that at least I think (at least I liked to see them happy and really happy) women and men, I do not know anything about relationships, but I feel, watching this movie I want to connect with someone, striving, pushing, wanting to be with someone, it seems to make life ... something completely different, I don't really know. is just, but I felt something and looked at this movie. I felt that the connection should be ... must make life worthwhile. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of movie it is. It is fun. It's CLEVER. It's TENDER. It causes emotion. It made me think that maybe, maybe just life is really a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Do you want LAVE? Want to feel really good! Do you want to get some answers about women (and girls, answers to men)? Watch Hitch. You Want-GET-IT-ALL !!! <br /> <br /> GO !!! You are a good person.
