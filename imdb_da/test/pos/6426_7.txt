Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator resident in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and cannot remember the last few days. She begins to follow a trace of memory fragments that lead her to the small town of Garma. People in town seem to recognize her, and she begins to suspect that the astronauts' innovative nightmares, which carry out terrible experiments, have something to do with their own amnesia. The film is interesting and the plot is good, but it is a bit to go slowly and artificially to my taste. The reason is taking some pretty twists and it is really hard to find out where it is going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia The Heretic"), and it's always nice to see "star" children's actor Nocoletta Elmi. Klaus Kinski's role, however, is too small. This is not a movie for die-hard gore hound or exploitation addict, but still a very good hour and a half mystery.
