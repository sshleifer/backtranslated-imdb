One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is highlighted halfway by the protagonist, the Mafia man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descriptive middle-aged man originally from Salerno in southern Italy. When introduced to him at the start of the film, he has been living a damn injury in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland for the last ten years. We carry out a gradual introduction to. While this pivotal but seemingly cumbersome scene is taking place, employees of the Swiss bank, usually counting Di Girolamo's cash, told him that $ 10,000 is missing in his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. On the news, he quietly threatens but icily his bank manager who wants to close his account. Meanwhile, he tells us the crowd that when you bluff, you have to bluff right to the end without fear of being caught or ridiculed. He says: You can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having done this - only half-timed and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is the very reason for the start of Titta Di Girolamo's problems. <br /> <br /> This original unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the brink of 50, a man who doesn't even match in nature to the boyfriends and waitresses who say hello and goodbye remains time any spectator cares deeply about. At some point in his non-life, Watch looks to be worried about being "ridiculous". The first half of the movie can be described as "slow" by some. In fact, it reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo in this hotel at a strangely rejected, deliberate pace that reveals seemingly earthly and irrelevant details. But scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just as important they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds to your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (a theme of the Scottish band boards of Canada appeared particularly). <br /> <br /> Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more in odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Le Conteguenze dell'Amore does not use this mechanism to symbolize a deeper emotional disadvantage that has been so deeply implicated in the uncertainty of the unconscious that it is almost impossible to pinpoint its cause (if in fact one). <br /> <br /> The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and reminiscent of Tita's best friend, a man he hasn't seen for 20 years, unexpectedly gives a little window to life, which Look at last (although cautiously at the beginning) agrees to look through again. Although it has never been explicitly spelled out, the viewer knows it to a man who watch, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. A movie without a single scene of sex or violence, a film unfolding in its own time and giving nothing to the spectators' expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of the small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has taken place in Italian cinema since the decline in Cinecittà in the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films ... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, the world.
