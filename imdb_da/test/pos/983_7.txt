Okay, I admit that if I didn't have children I would never have seen this movie and would never see it. But considering all the rat kids movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a significant improvement. And it had enough in that I was not completely upset with my skull or considered suicide (something I repeatedly did in the other two films). Sure, the performance is quite wide and the plot is a bit stupid - but it's a kids movie. And compared to other movies in the genre, it is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have some talent and will probably continue their career after puberty - at least on infomercials or low-overs. So if you're looking for a movie to watch with your kids, you could definitely do much worse!
