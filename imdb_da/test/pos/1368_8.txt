Man, I can't believe in the rough and negative comments on this movie. Okay, it's probably not a sophisticated work of cinema. But it's a great deal of entertaining sticky fun. Initially, the titular pumpkin head supernatural killer must be one of the most ridiculously stupid and rude things that ever stumble in front of a camera; He looks like something you would see in a fourth rate carnival spookhouse. Second, the moderate is ridiculously false and unconvincing, with the absolute highlight that arises when this annoying ultra-conservative woman is electrocuted by a toaster. Then there is the always welcome presence of the always lovely Linnea Quigley, who introduced with pleasure to take a nice, long, completely free shower that continues for two minutes. Incredibly, we also have performances of deceased schlock legends John Carradine as a vicious warlock and Cameron Mitchell as a horror television show host. In addition, the crying kings Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. The leader child actor Ryan Latshaw designs all the charming and working abilities of a moldy old tree stump. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts. The cruddy special effects are certainly less than special. The result is appropriately overwritten. Still, this movie has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it, which again makes this treasure a really delicious cheesy hoot to see.
