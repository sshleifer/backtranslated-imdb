"French Cancan" is one of my favorite all-time movies. It's a great movie. There is color, there is humor, there is music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities were always to show a creation, a fantasy. So the movie is not a historical movie. The final sequences where the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images. It's a movie you shouldn't miss.
