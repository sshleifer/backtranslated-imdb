Having seen other Bollywood flicks with Salman Khan in them, I can say this is my favorite of the newer ones. The songs are all quite funny, especially 'O Priya O Priya' which seems to have a good mix of Beatles, Indian music and (dare I say this) a little prince. The love stories are a little more credible than, says Chal Mere Bhai. The occasional focus on Prem's use of alcohol is sometimes disturbing as it doesn't seem to make sense to me, but Khan does well - even though his voice is creaking when he portrays obscenity.
