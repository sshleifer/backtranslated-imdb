All I can say is I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married around the time this show started !! Why did CBS take it out of the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy !! It made me laugh !! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it out of the air, my wife and I thought that CBS made a big mistake. You know what would be so good ?? Have a reunion show !! It would be so cool !! Anyone know if it's on DVD yet? On the last season of Promised Land, CBS showed the entire last season ?? I think CBS took it out of the air in the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with that theme song was amazing !!! This show comes only once in a lifetime! May we never forget promised land !!
