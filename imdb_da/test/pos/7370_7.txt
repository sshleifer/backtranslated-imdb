This film portrayed Dr. Giggles as the best horror movie I've ever seen. The reason was great, plot twists were even better and the casting was great. It is hard to believe that they gathered the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! <br /> <br /> The reason is simple. 4 teenagers destroy their car in the middle of the sky. They stumble upon this campsite and do what everyone in an accident does. Build a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The hook." Big opens. Anyone who is in high school has heard variations of this story on Prom night. But they do really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "Honeymoon." OK, this was not the best of 4. It was pretty good and you get to see some boobs. Emphisis on the word "some." It's just your basic being in forest history. <br /> <br /> 3. "People may look like." This is a warning about what is happening in internet chat throughout the country. This segment alone should be required to display to parents whose children have internet access. <br /> <br /> 4. "Cover." Now it's the best story in the whole movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this dumb girl's house. Very good plot twist. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie. I don't want to tell you what it is because I don't want to ruin it. I was never shocked during a movie in my life! <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Works: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> <A / <br /> <br / > General: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over 13 with the exception of "People Can Lick Too." Any parent whose child has internet access should see this with their child.
