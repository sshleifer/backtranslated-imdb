I've seen this show when I was younger. It's a really good show to see. It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years. Barney is definitely super DE duper. BJ is quite fun. Babie Bop is very sweet. The kids are also very cool. This show is about learning about numbers a bit like sesame gay but different kinds of shows and characters like Barney the purple dinosaur, B.J. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on the head and Baby Bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first to start was very old Barney and Friends show. But then the other was different from being new episodes. Also the last in 2000 was a new scene in Barney's park. They also have a show by Barney at Universal Studios in Florida, where you see Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop, and then when the show is finished, you play, act and meet Barney. It's a very good show watching this show as you learn about many things you'll like that movie and live the show at Universal Studios Florida.
