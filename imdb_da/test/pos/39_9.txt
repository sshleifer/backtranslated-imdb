Ever since I first encountered the divine wife Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It", I have been sold in the line of this highly gifted but terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her depiction here and to say that it is deserved is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here, she simply shines as the driving force and enters her community. This was particularly poignant to me because I grew up in this same period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked woooooooooooooonfulful memories of the lives and ages of the 50s and 60s and of women portrayed by Mrs Merkerson. She was meticulously and ablently accompanied by a warm, hot cast of performances one would enjoy again and again. I first saw Macy Grey's name in the credits and went hoom. Her performance was so good, I couldn't even recognize her until about a third of the way through. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to create a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully done. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less worried about the race's age, but infinitely more aligned with the characters' realm and the emotional diversity they give to exemplify that ultimately it is about choices we make and to what extent we accept the responsibility for these choices. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified and elegant presentation of African-American life and is most sure to be a classic. You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
