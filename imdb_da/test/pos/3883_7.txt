James Aaron, a chubby actor living in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that are not good for him. It is evident when Dick, a friendly store consultant, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in Chicago's Second City, is a loving man with no luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a spunky lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy herself. James has another job in some kind of gross "Candid Camera", where people are created for unusual situations, which, surprisingly, a mechanic and tells him he is the father of a daughter he never knew about. <br /> <br /> The day he meets his friend Larry, he is told about the casting call for remake of "Marty," his favorite movie. Being a great man, he clearly identifies with the character of the film. In many ways, James' own life is parallel to Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the picture. He will try the part because he knows he can do the right thing. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth on a soda source. James likes the woman, who one day invites him to shop with her for intimate clothes. He ends up having sex with her and thinks they have a good thing, but Beth has another surprise when she tells him why they went to bed, because she had never done it with a fat man. After being disappointed, James stumbles into an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. At the end we see James, who fulfills his long dream of joining a theater production of "Marty" in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, a gracious character man, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, his imprint on James Aaron is right on the money. As a director, he has done so before, even though this is an original concept that he must pursue. <br /> <br /> One of the movie's assets is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman gives an impression for her taking of Beth. Bonnie Hunt teaches the role of school teachers to good results. My Kolb is seen as her mother, a role she has played in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" with outstanding results. Director Paul Mazursky is also in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr., Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast are valuable contributions. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next effort will be welcomed by his fans.
