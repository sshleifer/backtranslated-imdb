This is a scary short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner provide performances that hurt, ring true and remain with you. Since this is called a tragic story, it is not so much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even if it is right for the story, because I had already come to break these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. Beautiful shot, acted, edited. High caliber works around, even for the use of the right sound and / or music to promote the story. Slutkredit sang finished the job and angry even more emotions from me. This is the first rate from start to finish. Kudos to the author / instructor and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comments section. I promised to do it in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. This is it, and that is the least I can do. I'm so glad I got to see it.
