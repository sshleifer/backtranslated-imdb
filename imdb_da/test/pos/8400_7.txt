This mini series is a reasonable sequel to the original Gone With The Wind. If one sees this on its own merits (and not immediately after the original), it comes out pretty well. I'm sure most viewers will ask questions about Scarlett and Rhett's performances, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this story, so comparing in these cases (Rhet's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will each be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of Spring Charleston and Ireland. Beware of it alone. It was of course a high budget TV miniseries. It follows the book for a while, so has a whole new plot when Scarlett goes to Ireland. The play is trustworthy, if not something special - a bit of the way I feel about Roger Moore after Sean Connery for James Bond.
