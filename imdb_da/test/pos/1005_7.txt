In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day counts the tiles in the ceiling and rearranges his sock drawer. Not happy with this forever, Jon Garfield takes a self-help group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a single-family 20-something whose best friend is a cat? After several failed attempts to get a girl, including a cringeworthy dance scene competing with David Brents' fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in the office (Disco is dead? Says Jon), he is more than shocked to find a sweet girl, there is as much as a shake as himself. Of course, they go on, but Garfield is worried that John will forget him and prefer to have children for a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With slimmer animation than previous TV specials, it feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
