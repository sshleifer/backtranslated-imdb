This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I watched the movie on TV in its Hindi version with its "Sita" character presented as Nita. I also notice that it is Radha who reviewed the allegorical trial of fire in the film and not Nita / Sita. But what I loved about the movie was its script of Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic to the end - just like the end of Mazursky's "An Unmarried Woman". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And a carton man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him --- carrying his invalid mother Biji. He finally seems to take a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms Mehta seems to fumble as an instructor (but compared to most Indian mainstream cinemas she seems to be brilliant) as she can't use her script to go beyond the microscopic family she presents, with the exception of presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. She even dedicates the movie to her mother and daughter (not her father!) But her Radha is reminiscent of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her with Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants - given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household can be sacred to some, but only captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that do not seem to strive for anything better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali films have touched on parallel themes in India, but did not have the publicity surrounding this film and therefore not seen by a broad segment of knowledgeable cinemas. <br /> <br /> Ms Das, Ms. Azmi Jafri and Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave amazing performances under good directors (Mrinal Sen's "Khandar", Gautam Ghose's "Paar", Benegal's "Ankur") a glimpse that is particularly absent in this film. Ms. Das sparkled because of her screen presence rather than her acting capacity. All in all, the film's strength has remained in the structure of the play, which is above average for international cinema. I am sure that Mrs Mehta can refine her writing talents in her future screens.
