The cell fascinated me at first glance. I was a little surprised at the fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If it had no history, the movie would be better. Bunuel's "Un chien andalou" commemorates - a film without history, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But the CELL is initially a Hollywood movie, and only another work of art. I am very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian can be very interesting, especially when it has the same look as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For movie music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is amazing, but a hard listening experience because of its very modernist style.
