Typically, a movie may have factors such as "revival", "good feeling", "sense of meaning", "plot" etc. There is always something that can be taken out of film, it's just a matter of how convincing the reason is, for me to own it in my collection. "Tales of two sisters", as they call it when it was released in my country, have a tremendous feeling and a last (most) self-explanatory plot. I love horror movies that revolve around a house. Titles that come to mind are "The Other", "The Haunting", "The Haunting of Hell House". This movie will be another good example I will remember. The film had extremely rich color in the way the house was decorated in the clothes as signs in children's colors that contrast with most horror films that typically use desatured tones and gloomy surroundings (think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, dark water, which is another show I like) that gives this movie a sense of aesthetics and joy when it was not in its more poignant moments. The characters are extremely credible. This can partly be ascribed to the known setting of this film. Perhaps it is also easier for both me and myself to create problems that the actors must identify with, and the actors bec ome their characters with outstanding finesse. the director's toys with timelines to give the audience the story in bits and pieces so that they can come to their own interpretative terms rather than presenting everything linearly. This is a positive aspect of this movie, in my opinion, and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find fun. I would definitely take care of this on DVD.
