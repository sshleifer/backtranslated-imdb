1. Looked at 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Well-established, independent film by Cassavetes introduced a style that was much different from what Hollywood shows the audience. This film also introduced some very taboo issues, especially the actual racism, which was probably widespread throughout the country, but was not shown by the most white-controlled filmmakers of the time. About the only black actors who had great respect at this time, they were acting and showing personality as white (aka. Sidney Poitier). Moreover, the idea of ​​ending a movie without concluding the conditions that began, left many filmmakers dumbfounded, but actually gets the viewers to realize that life is like this (it goes on ...). I prefer this kind of end because it makes you think more about the characters and what can happen next, and the conclusions are not just the basis for you. The film follows human lives (especially a few people who have a short relationship and happen to be opposite skin tones), then we look at what happens when the white man realizes what he has done. This is done very well and makes the film very special. The play is apparently made improvisational, which makes the film even more amazing. I think you can say I liked this movie if you can't tell it. If you can find it, check out this classic early independent movie.
