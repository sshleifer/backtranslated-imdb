Unlike some movies you might wonder about and do other things, this movie held me in front of the screen for two hours. I loved every minute. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that the story is not very credible. Especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government, and later he sent a package to the guy who helped him. Xiao Liu is a very good actor, he shows his feelings, and he shows his fragility and his love for that girl.
