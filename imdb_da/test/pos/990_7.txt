Although I am very familiar with poet Dylan Thomas, I know nothing about his life. Whatever his life and especially his marriage involved, I could imagine that the edge of love (based on the novel) manipulates things a little, but unless you're a historian or poet who cares. <br /> <br /> movies are less about Thomas and more focused on the two main women of his life. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera, who was his first love. A romantic night on the beach as a youth is something that both have tried to sit behind them, but cannot, now the adult is the good friends. I forgot to mention that this is set during the war. Vera gets engaged to Captain Will Kill whom he gets her pregnant and leaves for war. While away, Vera begins to fall to Thomas again, and Kathrine has fallen in love with him. She also carries another man's child. Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig returns <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is a very soap operative plot and it takes shape in a fairy tale kill slowly, with perhaps too many sequences of sappy dialogue . But everything is not lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think Edge of Love is as stylish a picture as you can get. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, Hollywood production or not. Some of it has to do with being put under the war, creating emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, a bit like reconciliation. one has plays and filmography of equal talent for Joe Wright's Oscar nominee, but there is much more need for stable pacing and progression. Things are okay at the beginning and end, but the middle section is where your attention can be tested unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in history. <br /> <br /> I doubt if The Edge of Love will have that kind of effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to check. It can even make a good date night movie, as it is so much smarter than the chick-flicks that lovers are forced to endure today.
