For a long time this was my favorite in the Batman movies. It had the best filmography and a distinguished feeling with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always interesting Christopher Walken. But after the last show, it finally struck in my reviews, and I honestly prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. The good one - it is still the most exciting of the five last-day Batman movies. The stylish cinematography here is the best of all the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films, which have great pictures, as this is a good example. The three letters mentioned above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the bad guys, I preferred the Catwomen and found her the most fun to see before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories, but you are never sad to see this. As he did in the first movie, Michael Keaton does a great job playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> The BAD - For a movie based on a comic book that mostly reads children, I still think of these two first Batman movies, both made by Burton, were too dark and the profanity certainly wasn't appropriate . Although, unlike the first movie, there was no use of the Lord's name in vain, there were still mockery and both villains made too many sexual comments. It would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this movie to children as well as adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is purely gross in stains. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants to "gross". Few men meanwhile complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer, who played Catwoman. Generally too much dark and some cheap shots on Christian bashing also made me aware of my previous high rating of this movie. OVERALL - Amazing pictures and memorable characters make this the most interesting in Batman series, but for a dark edge, too rough and too much anti-religious bias, all finally hit me after fifty looks at this movie. Sorry, but I prefer a children's milder Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was happy to see the series lighten up after that.
