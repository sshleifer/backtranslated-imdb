Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to match image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so once in a while the devotion to authenticity in Criterion DVDs is again. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the movie on VHS (BMG Classics) with an excellent resumption of music (by St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir). It is interesting to compare this film with modern propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938 in response to the fear of a German invasion; and Olivier in 1943 when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are stagey, but in different ways. Olivier starts by showing a stage play of the game in the Globe Theater by Shakespeare's own company and takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic (but still stylized) setting. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the start, but the dialogue and speakers are still influenced by the old Russian theatre's melodramatic conversion conventions. This works very well for Cerkassov's talks as Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and military leader had to play a role in the public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first big propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl's boring Willen's Triumph, which recorded a tremendous political play - massaging crowds that cheered Hitler's ranting speech. The propaganda in her masterpiece, movies from the Berlin Olympics in 1936, is much more subtle with her worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the Aryan superiority myth. But German propaganda films can also be subtle. Karl Ritters Urlaub auf Ehrenwort (Furlough on Aries word) is typical. It shows a young lieutenant letting the men of his company go for a day before returning to the WWI trenches (and almost certain death). Unlike the veterans' advice, he accepts their honorary words to return, even if he will be prosecuted and shot if they do not. Of course, they all return, even though some of them prepare for it, presumably inspiring the audience for similar screens of their duty. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the better World War II propaganda films was the Howard Hawks Air Force. In it we follow a bomber who is not in line with each other as they bind each other with the experience of the battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war. But typical of Hawks' movies is their real loyalty to each other rather than to their country. Eisenstein has to go far back in history to find Russian military triumphs. Ironically, Alexander (like the other Russian princes) descends from the Vikings who sailed into the Russian rivers to conquer and control their own fiefdoms. So he is a conqueror who rejects another, would be conquer. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors depicting the German princes were apparently selected for their ugliness and smothering stupidity). But the real contrast is between the ordinary soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles; while the German peasants shooting out of the wall to kill wounded Russians are one foot shorter than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. Russian servers in the Middle Ages were far better than their European counterparts because they could always escape into the desert and clear their own land. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also gives us our first view of Alexander as a fisherman. In the struggle with the Germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice and his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the wall, they have to regroup and massage on the western side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of Eisenstone's film (which most audiences miss) is the historically accurate way he portrays medieval Russia's politics. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod largely owed their growing wealth and prominence, putting the trades in power and sidelining the princes until their military expertise and feudal charges were needed to repel attackers. In the film Alexander not only appears as a military leader, but also as a master politician, who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory.
