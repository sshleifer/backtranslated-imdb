The short film that got Gaspar Noe on the film card introduced us to his horrible but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher, played brilliantly by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's direction here has all the characteristics of his later film, and shows that he cuts his own voice and style from the beginning. His sudden cut along with loud, loud sound, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques are all used to disturb the viewer. And it certainly works. He is also not afraid to show violence that viewers of irreversible will know. Here the violence is just as powerful, and in the sequel Seul Contre Tous it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a horse being killed. It's shot in the head and we see it writing on the floor, its pool of blood flowing out. We then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, The Butcher's daughter. He was orphaned in World War II, and has grown up hating the world and all and everything in it. He serves his customers, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts - he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who would also render her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about, and we see them grow older. She is, however, dumb and object of bullying and toys. The slaughter's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself, etc., but this is being explored more in the next movie. When she is attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with anger and puts an innocent man in his mouth. He goes to jail, taken from the only thing he wants - his shop and daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in the prison and release back to his world. Because of her daughter's state, autistic and I think she is bland, does little except staring and is in full control of her father. The film continues in the exceptionally bleak Seul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two movies, this one first. It has some really excellent plays, but it is very difficult to see because of the relentless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
