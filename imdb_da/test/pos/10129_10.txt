Radio is a true story of a man who did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do. The viewer is forced to wonder what he or she would have done. The adversity that Jones and Radio coach both faced was both tragic and predictable. People did not understand; nor did they want to understand. But in the end, the power relationship forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened. Radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little, besides three of the most important things, they are too often forgotten as we mature: Intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can't ignore the underdog's situation, just trying to play a bad hand in the best way he knows how. It was sad how coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that frightened the life of Radio was enough to make you punish punishment, not just the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. But on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would affect so many lives in the way that most of us think only happens in the movies. This movie is a real adventure and not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual shine. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.
