What I liked best about this animated film from 1941 is the great feeling it gives in the early 1940s. These are the songs, the clothes, the cars, the building lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you have withdrawn in time. From reading some of the reviews here, I see it was a hard-hat movie released a few days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the cinema for a cartoon during the events and shocking days I'm sure. Too bad because the people missed some nice animations, would really have impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. The colors are fine, drawings are good and the story involves as we encounter the bugs led by "Hoppity" and and his beautiful girl "Honey" to make it happy - always after and outside of injury. It is also about all those who find a grassy place they can live and not worry about people trampling them. There is an eerie villain, but "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, Mosquito") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn accents! The story is a well known one where an ugly old man will marry the sweet young thing and use unscrupulous means to force her hand. The good guy has meanwhile stacked against him, but in the end, of course it rules. My favorite part - it sounds worse than what it was - was when good guy "Hoppity" was temporarily galvanized and he danced in black and white. It was awesome animation! <br /> <br /> You know it's good, I didn't see this as a very young child; I would have been afraid to play outside and squash all the good bug people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass under your feet!
