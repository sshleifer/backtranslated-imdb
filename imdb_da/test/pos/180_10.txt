Here is a film of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. Plus, it's set back in the late 1800s, making it even more interesting. It's a wonderful adventurous story, and Alyssa Milano is great at playing the healthy, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy ... a great role model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie that has to be seen over and over and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the story excellent, but the film also has fantastic scenery and music and is wonderfully directed. This movie is as good as gold!
