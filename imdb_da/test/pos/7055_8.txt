Wildman Chief Advisor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in top nutty form in his first leading role) presides over the various crazy hi-jinks on the North Star summer camp. Tripper turns sad and lonely misfit kid Rudy (a nice and affecting performance of Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman tells the entertaining of the wall comic vignettes at an incessant snap pace and maintains an engaging good-natured tone throughout. This film negatively negates the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: creating friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfires singalongs and of course the inevitable scary legend of the escaped psychic killer with the hook hand. The feeling of pleasing raucous fun this image generates is positively contagious. In addition, humor is always silly and occasionally rough, but never too ugly or transparent. Best of all, there is a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with that humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy is really touching). The cast has an obvious ball that plays their characteristic characters: Murray's glorious gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly flooded (his crazy PA messages are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there is audio contribution from Harvey Atkin as the effortless camp owner Morty, Kate Lynch as Tripper sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the gracious Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet, foxy AL, Sarah Torgov as feisty Candace, Jack Blum who klutzy admired geeks Spaz, Keith Knight as tubby slob Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling who picks Wendy, and Matt Craven as hip hardware. Donald Wilders film film gives the film an attractive sunshine look and makes nifty use of cloth. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score does the same. A real uprising.
