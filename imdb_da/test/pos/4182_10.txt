When I first saw this movie, I also expected "our boys" to be sweet and more like an extended version of the TV show. I haven't "got it" since then. But years later, on a party years later, in the 70's type PAR-TAY, where certain substances had been smoked, inhaled and with lots of tequila, "HEAD" was late at night. We saw it and finally realized what "HEAD" was about. It spoofed their own show, as shown in a song that called itself "a produced image". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobio, "They made a monkey out of me," he obviously admits that everyone in the movie had been open all night smoking grass. They made fun of themselves, society, everything! Great film! Tho, like a 52 year old granny, I no longer "indulge", I still see this movie when I want a good LOL !!!
