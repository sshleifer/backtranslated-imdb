GLORIFYGE NOT GLAMORIZED 2nd World War. <br /> <br /> We've had a lot of documentaries about World War II on regular TV programming. Without looking up any information in the encyclopedia or movie book, it seems that this old memory can remember most names alone. There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of the war memoirs of a general of the army and later the 33rd President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower. It told the story of the conflict in Europe that the Supreme Allied Commander had seen. <br /> <br /> Then there was a CRUSHED in the PACIFIC (the subject self-explanatory) that I can't remember much about. Newspaper / Author, Jim Bishop hosted / navigated for BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALENTIVE YEARS. * The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. The first aired in the 1960-61 season here in the states and boasts of having Richard Burton speak the words of Sir Winston. It is the 1952 NBC television network's production of our topic today, this VICTORY AT SEA, which wins the cigar, hands down. <br /> <br /> Initially, this would have taken production several years of careful and literal sorting through thousands of hours of movies. The film footage featured here was the official recorded record taken by members of the United States Federation, independent news movie, Motion Picture Record from our other allied partner countries, as well as captured Axis images from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> When it was achieved, the different corresponding films had to be cut and edited in a series of 1/2 hour installments. This was done with great skill as there were so many scene changes, whether made abruptly or as a solution. The appearance of eternal episode seems so smooth as if it had been a single movie project. <br /> <br /> The writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest film was no less amazing and unique. The highly polished and meaningful eloquence does not waste a word and sometimes even undermines the description of action, rather than exaggerating it. The story goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented actor for stage, film, radio and television. He has certainly achieved a measure of immortality using his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions. Finally, VICTORY AT SEA has the luxury of having an original score, both open-minded and random music, written by Richard Rodgers from Broadway fame. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complicated, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The classic event was played by NBC Symphony Orchestra led by Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette tape / compact disc, it has been continuously available and in demand since its first release 55 years ago! And really little wonder, because it is this musical score that is so fascinating to the viewer / listener. It really puts frosted on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALENTIVE YEARS also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score. This was also composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We had additional "Ace in the Hole" in our house of our Father's person, Late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). Father had been in U.S. Navy during the war, introduced in 1943 or '44. Our pop was always ready to explain and further elucidate any of the situations depicted in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, the now 90-year-old Bertha (no Fuerst) Ryan already had my older sister, Joanne (1942-90) as a dependent.
