I didn't see this movie until it appeared on TV because I was questionable about cartoon flicks. Ever since the Batman series, "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pitiful pg-13 bombs, I killed everything at all costs. I would question myself: "Why can't anyone make a movie that is rated R and stick to the story, how hard is it?" And finally, my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out the sides of the screen with pure violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yes, it is true that many action flicks contain all these treats and most have bombed. But not Blade, the film was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Leaves are actually one of the best real comics I've seen for a long time.
