After reading the horrible reviews of this movie, including comments that are quoted from Colin, I hardly disturbed adding this movie to my Firth Film collection, but being Firth Fan, as I am, intrigued it better of me! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It had excitement, drama and intrigue and the V.sexy Colin scene. The plot kept me guessing to the final credits, and I felt that when you passed Jennifer Rubens the opening scene, the actor played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as ever and it was great to see him play a sign from the 'Dark side', a 'chill went down into my spine' and after seeing this I can't wait to see Colin's latest movie 'Trauma 'Soon to be on DVD. OK, maybe it wasn't a movie that was 'in your face' so to speak, and you couldn't 'sleep on the plot', especially at the end, as there was a lot going on, but that was what I liked about That, the play was subtle, fortunately not overdone (like many thrillers), it made the movie the more chilling to see. One couldn't just guess what Colin's character (Ross Talbert), or for that matter Jennifer Ruben's character (Jamie Harris) was going to do next, and there were a lot of surprises in the store I sat on the edge of my seat throughout with a pillow handy !! Personally, I am very happy that I saw 'Playmaker' and I will definitely rewind and watch again. I think any Firth Fan would benefit from watching this movie if they didn't like the plot so just watch Colin ;-))
