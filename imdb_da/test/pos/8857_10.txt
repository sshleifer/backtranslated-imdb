The stupid saying, "You can't touch this" applies here certainly. With all the clonic horror and sci-fi movies coming out with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find something worth 2 hours of your time. Therefore, I always trust the classics who scared the weaving out of me when I was a pre-teen. <br /> <br /> The TING is undoubtedly in my mind the most eerie, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, however, is not (the OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of fear, isolation and mistrust it promotes in character and seer. <Br /> <br /> You can't get more distant than Antarctica, and in this howling is freezing white setting where history takes place. Several Americans, scientists and military men are stationed there. One day they testify of a Siberian Husky dog ​​running for dear life from gun-moving Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost fights with a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It can lose in obnoxious slimy bloody forms before it's done, but when it's done, if you didn't see it, you can't tell it to humans or other normal land animals. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine casts. This movie is the reason why horror can be a great genre. It actually scares me. The alien blood "jumps" out of the Petri dish when the hot wire touches it, still makes me jump! <br /> <br /> Still the scary of them all.
