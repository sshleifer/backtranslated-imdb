While not for everyone, Crackerjack is a pleasure to see, with the tongue planted firmly in the cheek. The sympathetic character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, scamming the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a few dollars on the side and selling the parking lot to work colleagues. When the Bowling Club members have to charge some money to save their club, they invite Jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls. Filled with Aussie Charm, Mick Moly's shows laconic humor (he also wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his previous work in Radio. Perfect Aussie casting with Bill Hunter as Jack's bowling mentor Stan Coombes, John Clarke (of The Games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as Jack's flatmate Dave and Judith Lucy as the rugged journalist, Nancy. <br /> <br /> I first thought that only Molloy fans liked this flick but judging by the number of blue rinse sets that left the cinema's chuckling, this is a movie for everyone.
