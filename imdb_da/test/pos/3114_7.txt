George Cukor is and will always be one of my favorites. The unfortunate one of his generation. No one mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, yet he looks at his filmography. From sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A Double Life" a large semi-western "Heller in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my Aunt "He was at the service of his actors, he never sat down in front of the camera. I feel some tenderness by seeing "Rich and Famous" flashes of the old master still very much as evidence. Candice Bergen, for the first time in his career, gives us a glimpse of the wonderful comedian she was becoming. Jacqueline Bisset is a step backwards to Greer Garson's and Loretta Young's and Hart Bochner's days when we tease us and promise something spectacular that ultimately comes to light in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", Meg Ryan, when Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan . As tired as the formula is, it remains a Cukor movie and for what I collect one of Almodovar's favorite films.
