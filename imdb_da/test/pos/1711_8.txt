If (as I have just pointed out in the yeast) the Keaton follows the tradition of the comics that are in violation of the law, this Langdon card (the last one released before making TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) based on another cartoon - is married to a shrewish spouse and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel & Hardy did this in several movies, like Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with it - why are these characters always married to such unpleasant women? And there's an interesting sociological side question - why don't you find female comics married to male colleagues for these shrews? I can't remember anyone, except in a Carol Burnett rubbish, where the two nastarian two-member members find that they prefer to have someone, give it as well as they get (some kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also assurance, that their not married to a namby pamby type). As for the fact that the comics marry shrews, I suppose one can imagine that they get what they deserve. Or do they? Ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him? Yes, he went to this convention in the desert eagles that destroyed his plans, but he wanted to have private time - there is nothing to suggest that he and Stan cheated their wives. In fact, he is cremated by Mae Busch because he lied to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife. Here, Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown in the beginning to talk to her mother about how to keep him under strict control. We see Harry at his job (it is Saturday morning, and the job ends at noon the rest of the weekend - it was before the idea of ​​a five days a week, 40 hours a week in the industry). He works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal in shape (an early joke about Langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscles to swing a sledge hammer). He just misses his tram, trying to light a man. He calls home to explain things and gets a tenderness from the missus to be two minutes late. On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent), who has met two beautiful, sweet girls who just want a date. Harry is hesitant, but accepts it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for hot dogs for the foursome - he has a 1926 silver half in his pocket). But his plans appear when his wife discovers his hidden "cache" of coins. He keeps it hidden under the living room carpet, and finds it by walking along the edge of the carpet. But his wife spies on him and confiscates all that. Later, she hears him talk to herself and berate her. In contempt she gives him a crown and says he can treat his date to a soda. But Harry has another cache of coins and dresses for the date - and goes out. He and Dent are apparently late, and Dent leaves Harry, but Harry tries to make it to him: he produces two prostitutes. They go into a quarrel when Dent (wise) says they are not the type of girls he had termed "nice". Eventually the girls arise and the date begins. But soon Harry hides in the seat of the seat when his wife walks past in his roadster, and the girls' boys turn up - angry at their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The card works well and is fun, and gives a better idea of ​​the person Harry Langdon developed in his short star as a comic master. He is constantly pointed out by others. He misses his tram because a stranger needs to ask for a smoke and a light, and eventually the stranger gets his own. The nice girl who is Harry's date has a little dog that chases him away. He rests between two cars, both of which start to run away, and he ends up winding around a pole. It certainly shows that Langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time he made his functions. If only he could have kept the complex all together beyond those first three moves.
