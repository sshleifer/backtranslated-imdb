According to Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers Party", which, of course, we all know as the Nazis, their grip on the country increasingly tightened as time passed. Early in their grave trampling of the German people, they called all artists, newspaper men and filmmakers into their Nazi headquarters in order to be informed of what the newly declared "third kingdom" (aka "empire") is expected of them. <br /> <br /> Mr Fritz Lang, the chief director of the German cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era, called to meet with Herr Goebels; he listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the minister of the propaganda office, Mr. Lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Fritz Lang didn't even go home to Germany (at least not many years later. He remained in France and eventually immigrated to the United States.) <br /> <br /> MR. LANG went straight to work in America and created a series of most comfortable, solid and substantially literary upper echelon movies for many years. Included in this blackboard of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION (20th Century Fox, 1941). /> <br /> TYPICALLY a movie about Old West and Pioneer Days needed both the quality and the amount of cast. WESTERN UNION qualified for both requirements. We are treated with a great selection of star language talent as well as a supportive cast that makes almost every minute and every scene a pleasure for our senses. The main role is Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. Other prominent shows are people like John Carradine (don't play a vampire or other scary guy, but a doctor), Geor give "Slim" Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and candidate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always Reliable support player and former songs in "The Avalon Boys" and badly bad guy Barton MacLane. Added to this mix we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's Bridge). <br /> <br /> PROMINENT in American Indians is: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. Also, there is a large representative of the Aboriginal people of North America, the great, uniquely impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <br /> The recording of the fine outdoor scenes was done on the spot in Arizona and Utah and rendered in the highest class by the technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley, but that's John Ford Province). In some respects, this movie is a far more amazing achievement than we might think; for it took a kind of paper magazine history, adapted it to taste and idioms from pre-war America in the late thirties and early eighties. All of this is done by a German born director who had only been in Hollywood and America for the shortest time. <br /> <br /> In its final analysis, WESTERN UNION, while perhaps not the most historically accurate example of the Western genre; we just don't care. It scores in all the necessary categories needed for a good night in the cinema! So who really cares about small details like "accuracy"? <br /> <br /> We give Mr. Lang and 20th Century Fox a rating of ****! PLEASE NOTE: * We've just seen one particular on the PBS station WTTW, here in Chicago it was all movie actors, directors, and other artisans that the Nazis were in power caused to take refuge in America and Hollywood. (It seems that filmmakers and researchers were the biggest export to Germany at this time, namely that scientists who built the Atomic Bomb, as well as future NASA people came from Europe at this time.) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
