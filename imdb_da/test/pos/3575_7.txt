Jim Varney's performances as Harem Girl and A.U. is incredibly fun - on a level that exceeds Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is amazing in her once-in-a-lifetime role as the hometown waffle waitress longing for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the film was irreparably bad due to the cruel plot. Ernest Goes to Africa's decision makers did not meet the creative challenges associated with low-budget film production. Only worth looking at the cable.
