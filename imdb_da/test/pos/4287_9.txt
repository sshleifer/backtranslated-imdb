Now it's the kind of movie we used to get every week. Now it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast that speaks to each other. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car crashes or any chases that are implicit sexual situations. This is not the movie for the younger crowd. It is for those who appreciate people talking to each other. They argue a lot as we have married couples having problems in the middle of their lives. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are apparently a very happy middle-aged loving man and wife. Now living in this same small suburb of London, beautiful, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his wealthy father. <br /> <br /> Of course, he meets Emily Watson. It would be easy for anyone to get infected by Emily. I say no more, except that when the credits begin, there is a fatal accident, the rest of the film is about the consequences of this accident and all the lies the various signs tell. <br /> <br /> It is performed by this trio and the others are excellent. Julien Fellows wrote the script based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also instructed this was his first direct attempt and he did very well. The whole production is first rate. <br /> <br /> The movie had a few months of theatrical running at the end of 2005, being below 80 theaters. This for me is a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but really good dramas like this and many others open only a few. <br /> <br /> There are, by the way, some very fun lines for some situations. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
