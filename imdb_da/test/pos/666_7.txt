This BRASS EYE special PAEDO GEDDON was flooded with complaints (More on that later) when it was broadcast in 2001 after a national debate on a possible "Sarah's Law" after abduction and murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. In fact, scheduling is delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after finding out that he had been fooled by performance producer Chris Morris to launch a campaign called Nonce-sense. If the truth tell this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content that is in very bad taste, but I admit that I laughed out loud. The issue is about pedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the speaker who tells the audience that a notorious pedophile has been launched in space, announcing that an eight-year-old child has accidentally been placed in the capsule along with the pedophile. Cue the child's scared screams. As I said very badly tasted <br /> <br /> Other highlights of the show include Dr. Fox, who gives a scientific lecture that pedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ("No one knows this but it is a scientific fact") ) Labor MP Barbara Follet gives a public warning about equipment pedophiles putting on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that pedophiles can send gas over the Internet, making small children susceptible to sexual predators including a victim "Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a three-year-old colonel ". Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection group a serious picture who would like to know if they are classified as indecent. The pictures contained Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite image with a young boy's head, a dog's body and an upright penis that could only belong to John Holmes. Hi, I never said this show was tasteful, did I? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO GEDDON without the hypocritical fall that surrounded it where politicians, children's organizations and police officers rushed to condemn the show to make fun of a very serious issue. The view was bad taste despite me laughing all the way through it, but it's a biting satire. Critics might want to take a long look in the mirror, where a liberal elite allows sentenced pedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before criticizing a single TV show to exacerbate the tensions.
