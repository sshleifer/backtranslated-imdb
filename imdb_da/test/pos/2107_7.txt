Alexander Lou, star of classics like "Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja" headlines here in this entertaining martial arts celebration. <br /> <br /> The reason involves the evil Abbott White (boasting some humongous and honestly some scary-looking white eyebrows) using the help of a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin temple. <br /> <br /> This goal he achieves and further expands most of its members, although it is not necessary to say one or two manage to survive and rather predictably continue with the exact possible revenge on miscreant Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Okay, so the plot doesn't exactly push the envelope for creativity, but sees someone on a movie titled 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really cares for such a negligible factor as a plot? Of course not! - These are the games that matter in these movies and with gum - you get your money here! There are some fantastic choreographed martial arts exhibited by all involved in this and rarely one minute seems to pass by without a fight breaking out for some reason. If you are into martial arts at all then this is a must see!
