I caught this movie late at night on TV and expecting a low budget campy "masterpiece", I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Joly's unique ability (or should I say it?) Make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible. There is a plot; A rather intricate plot on what involves conspiracies and lengths a couple (a human, an android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a "big brother" -type figure and android killer thrown into the mix. Production and sets were also much better than expected. I haven't seen the original Cyborg, so I can't really compare it to much else; Granted this movie is no Blade Runner, but as a late-night, futuristic guilty pleasure, it's worth seeing.
