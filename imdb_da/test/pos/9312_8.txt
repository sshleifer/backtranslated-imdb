The first time I saw this movie was on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real hoot and made the trip over with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight. I tried to find a copy of it without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Now I have seen it twice, I recommend it as good entertainment. My only real criticism is that the choice of English translation words for the subtitles is underpinned even by normal standards. The subtitles are also small to small, mixed into the movie too often and often travel too fast to read well.
