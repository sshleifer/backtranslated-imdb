Hysterically painful; Maybe that kind of movie, Chekhov would have made if he had made movies. What is really fun is that the two cousins ​​have so much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong). What is really funny and uncomfortable about these signs is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other - or anyone else! It's terrible. If you've ever been too shy, worried, self-involved or just plain afraid to talk to someone (and who doesn't?) You will definitely see yourself in this movie. And it won't be beautiful. <br /> <br /> It keeps a mirror up to the audience and says, "If you don't like what you see ... change it".
