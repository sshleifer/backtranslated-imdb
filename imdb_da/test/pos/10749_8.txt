This production was a surprise to me. I absolutely love obscure early 30's movies, but I wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If you by chance are not convinced in the first half, stay there for the final. Of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely current. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think CAT'S PAW is not available on video / DVD yet. See your PBS listings!
