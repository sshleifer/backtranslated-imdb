I first heard about Commander's Log when I was on concom for the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making a great budget. I must say I was very happy when I finally got the chance to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarves are inevitable since the first seasons of the red dwarf were also shot at a low budget (although the commander's log must put some sort of record for the smallest amount of money spent per minute of air time), and thus make up for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious but clueless persona. <br /> <br /> The original idea of ​​Bowlsby was to tell the story of two-minute "interstitials", shown in between other shows during an evening, although for some reason Space didn't get how cold an idea this would have been and then the interstitials were all rolled up in an hour's show, which Space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (which premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (shown at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you are in contact with your local founding community can catch news about showing a place near you.
