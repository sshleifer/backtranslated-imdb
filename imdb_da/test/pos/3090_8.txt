As another IMDb reviewer puts it "... imagine 2001: A rumodysys in the desert" and you wouldn't be far away from a brief summary of what to expect from this movie theater (I hesitate to use words "movie" ). A lecture on philosophical views of creationism, mythos' surrounding humanistic existence, before and after, that was what was, what is and what will be. This for some may be a "2001" on sand, but they tackle various philosophical views, one on the evolution and future, the hope and potential of humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical trek. I only hope that I can communicate it effectively enough. Herzog's style will not be everyone's taste, and those who are not of a perceived hardcore branch film can and will probably find this extremely hard going, and cannot even see it through to their finals after 72 minutes. Fusion Morgana combines a montage of footage from the Sahara, including villages, villagers and various locations for a somewhat surreal ending, music of different genres and an almost mythical tale. Fata Morgana is hard slow, but ultimately extremely rewarding. <br /> <br /> Opening with a fitting of various filmed shots of airplanes landing for almost five minutes, you already get confused much to the introduction of the movie and the feeling that this will not be like something you have seen before echoing clearly in your mind. Divided into three sections, creation, paradise and the golden age, Fata Morgana tries and succeeds in equating images of the desert's natural beauty with the man making instruments that damage it. Its three segments are told by different people, each of whom relates to the particular section they speak and puts extra emphasis on the long soliloquys and desert assemblies. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a movie dealing with the existence of man on our land. It looks at the natural beauty that the earth was designed for, while looking at the potential beauty we have within us, especially showing us our negative contribution to the world we live in. Each shot has been purposefully constructed using what can only be described in the context of this film as 'The Holy Trinity of Filming' in pictures, words and music. Each part of these three pieces gives something special to each shot, but as they gather, they create something larger than their whole parts, creating spooky beauty and deep thought in our minds. I will not be able to do this movie justice, it deserves with pure words alone, maybe if I had pictures and a score, and I know, it will not be appreciated by the masses, but it is a profound one and I will not use term "art film" because this is just art. This moves art that moves the mind and praises the soul. Whether creationism is your will is irrelevant because this film is about intelligent design.
