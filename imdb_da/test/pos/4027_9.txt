We saw La Spettatrice last night @ Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a joking tale of loneliness and missing connection, where longing for intimacy is contrary to our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamics between them are very surprising. After all the films that devalue older women, it is wonderful to see Flavia (a professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful and sensual as well as seductive and powerful. We are conditional on believing that when a younger woman enters the "mix", the older woman will envy the younger woman, the man will leave the older woman to the younger woman, etc. In this movie, emotional truth is significant more complex. Highly recommended.
