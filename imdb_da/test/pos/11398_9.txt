Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing prepares one for his soul. Yes, it has soul, while tackling the wisest of the subject with both a crooked smile and respect. The brilliant cast and wonderful character development combines the performances of the best of the stage, which works with improvisation within a cinema verite style. <br /> <br /> The reason turned out to be richer than I had expected, and the underlying themes were justified quite deeply as each "B grade" person is brought through crisis in perspective. <br /> <br /> A sociologist's dream study, recognizing the film's raw truth about what we all know about self-esteem, parenting love and lack of it, attention / love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, desperately in need of hearing. Something for everyone here .. almost camouflaged as problems with inaccuracies and their separate environment, but of course they are universal. The film works on a number of levels. The ironic loop is that the depicted environment exists only because of voyeur that happens to watch the movie ... Boogie Nights is not judgmental of its object and characters, a rarity. It deserves every recognition it has gained and more.
