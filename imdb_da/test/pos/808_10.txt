David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, provided an outstanding achievement as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to bare excess on his mouth with incredible perfection! You could just see the expressions on the face of the detective and see that he never missed a thing of importance in the suspected behavior. The beautiful fall colors through the English landscape were simply breaths. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who could keep very important secrets away from Mr Poirot. A very funny movie if you really like to perform by David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
