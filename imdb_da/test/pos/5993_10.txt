One of the two best films of the year. A well-filmed, well-written, well-composed film with an excellent cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship show in their performances. Theresa Lee plays his comedic role well (Although it looks like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.) And I was cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something I haven't done since 1. Fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. John Woo's Hardboiled. Sure the end was expected, but I feel better to cheer for the police than a bunch of young gang members. Very pleasent.
