I just watched this movie tonight. Getting into it, I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman a lot, and Susan Sarandon is also a great actor, but it was far better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie that feels great. The action was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by recently. Natalie Portman is destined for good things, and I'm a college student at NYU, thinking it's great that she goes to school instead of just being an actor. Anyways, back on topic, the movie keeps you interested all the way through, and I certainly believe everyone should see it. I'd give more details, but I won't give away the movie.
