Yes, maybe there are parts of this movie that require a little bit of faith, but it doesn't take away from the charm of the movie and weird. It was shown as part of our city's youth film festival and was the organizational committee's favorite. It's not surprising. The subject - which comes together in a race reef, but post-apartheid South Africa is very topical, and the treatment of the theme is inspiring. Of course, as the previous comment mentions, the film has its shortcomings, but the realism of the decor and the way in which the director deals with his subject resembles these shortcomings. I saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the kids. A movie to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
