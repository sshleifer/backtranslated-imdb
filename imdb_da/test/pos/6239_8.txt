Despite a foolish premise, ridiculous plot units and low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to be striking. An inventive, beautifully-scored movie, one must see. You need to throw rationality out of the window to fully understand what the director was trying to do. If you can do that, you'll be in a pleasant surprise. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that were not destroyed by many successors.
