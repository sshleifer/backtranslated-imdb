This is not the best movie you can ever see, but it is still very refreshing. Of course, it is missing, it has humiliating moments and yet it is different from what you are used to and is fun in a way that only the French can give you this. You may recognize a little from the masterpiece Amelie when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but still recommend it to you if you are tired of the usual drilling you can rent in videostore.
