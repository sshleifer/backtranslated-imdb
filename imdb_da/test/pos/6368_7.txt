I am surprised that this, well above the average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd turns his usual satirical as a boy who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retires to California to start his work on advising on a radio program pretending to be the infamous dr. Lawrence Baird. The only one who knows he's a cheat is the drowning priest (Walter Matthau) who comes together to be pampered by Ackroyd's new found wealth that has blamed him. Charles Grodin also casts a good supporting performance. For her genre, I think this movie deserves the same credibility as 'Ferris Bueller' or 'Trading Places'. 7.5 / 10
