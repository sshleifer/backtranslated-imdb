When I saw LAUREN BACALL doing CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on the screen. But here Ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments, as the dentist pretends to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife, so he can continue with the fibers he has told GOLDIE HAWN. It is a story that is played for laughing from the beginning to the end, stuffed stuff that never runs dry and humorous during its time. There are lots of one-liners or gags that are far beyond the usual situation, comedy things one hears on the television lines, poorly true, because they blend so well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> As the daffy girl contemplating (at the beginning) committing suicide over his unhappy affair with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star on TV's "Laugh In") makes a stupid blonde role to perfection. Easy to see why she won the Supporting Actor Oscar. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Ingrid picks up a rare comedy role, though there are times when she just seems a bit too matronic for that. In any case, she is a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts the freezing process in the office, but is considerably warmer. When Goldie's neighbor, Igor, lets Rick Lenz admire himself and make an appropriate match for her in the final scene. Matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in the trade in all the Neil Simon roles he had - a lovable cad caught in his own fairs when he tells, lies after lies. It's the kind of rib-kitty comedy that makes you laugh aloud on some of the entertaining lines that Abe Burrows and IAL Diamond have managed to scrape together, based on a French farce.
