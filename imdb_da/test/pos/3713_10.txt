Two soldiers are an excellent example of fine filmmaking. The director and the producer took a heartfelt story and brought it to life with a very talented and dedicated cast, excellent filmography and very creative artistry. <br /> <br /> The casual burner's lifestyle was portrayed with great detail and strongly opposed to the militaristic lifestyle that they were promoted. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they fought for a hard but peaceful life in North Carolina's forest and an even tougher wartime. The action was great, especially from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), to the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the tremendous powerful performance (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well-molded. <br /> <br /> Enjoying the magic of Two Soldier, I highly recommend it to audiences of all ages.
