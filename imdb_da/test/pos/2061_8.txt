"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The reason is very familiar with that of Bourne Identity, but so what. The battle scenes are a great treatment for the eyes, and the plot line is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours. It is aligned with a sleek sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and walks past his usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The movie's baddie is too cheesy and you can tell what will happen to him. <br /> <br /> It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners like Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definitely one of the best actioners this year. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
