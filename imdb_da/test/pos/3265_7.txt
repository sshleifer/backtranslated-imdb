It's hard to know what to do about this weird little Aussie crime movie - on the one hand it's an enjoyable little movie with a good sense of humor; but on the other, it lacks just one particular thing that ensures that the film never reaches the limit that holds it trapped within the 'interesting' area. That said, Two Hands is a well-placed movie that juggles several stories at the same time, allowing several small climaxes throughout the movie and helping to stop the movie from getting boring again. The absurdity that goes on, the thick Australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help ensure that the movie is also entertained. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who believes he will move on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local king. He does not make the job land him only in trouble when he wants a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach, which is immediately stolen by a couple of children who have their lifetime on a shopping game. But everything is not rosy for our hero; who should find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film consists of a cast of unknown; At least it was back in 1999, which today is Heath Ledger something of a name. However, he does not impress too much here, as his performance is mainly of one note, and he does nothing for a very convincing lead. He fits the movie by being Australian and looking naive; But besides that, he's not the best management I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have much screen time, but he steals every scene he is in, and it is he who gives the film a lot of humor. He has nothing to do with the best order, though in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robber ever caught on film. On the whole, I recommend this movie to people who enjoy unrelenting crime movies; as the strange wealth is abundant, and the way events take a trip to the bizarre is fun; But if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I can't really say that Two Hands will float your boat. It's not a must see, but if that's your thing and you get a chance to see it ... you probably won't regret it.
