This wonderful short will hit home with anyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to get something that would mark you for life with your peers and was told by your mother or father (or both) that it did nothing when you sincerely began to consider acquiring in a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For those American residents who don't get horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan gets a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan who gets a Red Sox jersey. It's not beautiful. For our European friends, think of two great rival football matches (soccer for us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a shirt from the other. Ouch!!! NFB of C even issued here! <br /> <br /> A homage to you Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Merci, M. Richard.
