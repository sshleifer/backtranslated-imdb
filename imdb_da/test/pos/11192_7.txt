so i dont want to disagree with the critics but i was really not everything that moved this movie. I was a little hesitant to rent it, as I go through some of the same things that the protagonist has to experience. but I rented it and thought that I could experience some cathars or at least understand that I am not alone. while I understood the protagonist's annoyance with his careless cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as much as I would have liked. I felt that more emphasis was placed on his disturbing cousin exceeding his welcome. It is a beautifully filmed movie and I greatly appreciate the use of silence to give the feeling of isolation.
