I can never count on whether this is the artistic soap opera ever produced, or the sweetest art film. No matter, John Seales cinematogaphy is amazing. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for one time it has increased to film. If there is a mistake, it is in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with his length has almost certainly not read the book and probably cannot read. I don't like repeating adjectives, but convincingly serves the purpose. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story, the players excel. But it's the Australian sense of light and shadow that ultimately triumphs. As some antipodean Dutch champions, Seale uses a blast of light, where Van Rijn would have used shade. One could cry for cinematography this magnificent.
