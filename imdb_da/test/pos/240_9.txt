In Brooklyn, night club dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in McGuire's, owned by his boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday night: they order oysters in a bar and try to find a gem. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins a competition as the front page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a large theater in Broadway whose owner suggests her. She loses her happiness and begins to drink in her new lifestyle, misses the love of Danny and her old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a lovely romantic comedy, very naive and has magnificent parts such as beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing, singing and acting; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dances with herself and with Rusty and Genius on the streets; The songs and dance choreography are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost uncomfortable with her chauvinist behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda', but she's amazing in 'Cover Girl'. According to the information on the cover of VHS, 'Cover Girl' was the first musical in which the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, rather than being "thrown" into the movie. My 16 year old son watched this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and the beloved 'Cover Girl'. Therefore, I dare say that this classic is recommended for any movie lover and not just for the old generations. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models')
