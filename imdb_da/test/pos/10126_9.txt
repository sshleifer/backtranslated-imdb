This is a movie you will either love or hate. I loved it. If you are looking for excitement, you will find great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. In this movie. It's a good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. The heroes of the movies are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) a mentally delayed man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I suppose I didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did because it felt really right. I know people like these. I have seen jocks who find it fun to choose the vulnerable. I've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. I have seen people who believe that high school football is serious business. I've seen people who know what's really important in life. Any of these people could have been people I knew. I laughed I cried. I left the movie good, remember there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there are no people like you in your, you may not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you will hate it.
