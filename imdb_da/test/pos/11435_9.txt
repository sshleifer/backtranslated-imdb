When I went to the cinema, I didn't expect much. I didn't know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see because I was in a small town then. So I watched this movie and I was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a trip through the new industrial China and it shows it honestly! You see most of the time the ugly places in China and you see what really happens to this new industrialization. The main characters are sad but hopefully people. He is the naive Italian guy who can't believe what he sees. She is a translator from China who lacks her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes fun but every time poetic! A wonderful movie with amazing actors! So only one star is missing!
