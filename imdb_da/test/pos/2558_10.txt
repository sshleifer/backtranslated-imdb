my boyfriend as we walk in the cold London night in Leicester Square after the film says: If they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you might have thought it was the slum in a South American city or some other slum around the world , not Queens in NYC. Ramin Bahrani is now my official hero because he apparently has dedicated his work not to show the American face, but the real face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop shop is reality turned into a movie, is more realistic than a documentary, in fact, I think Ramin Bahrani's movie is more realistic than documentary. This is a good movie, but don't expect any cargo or shooting. This film is about tragic life on the margins of the richest, richest country in the world.
