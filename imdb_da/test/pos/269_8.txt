"Prime Suspect 4" continues the exploitation of the harmless and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the remarkable absence of the founder Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same grim reality in the first three series, the other three series renovate Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with medieval, loneliness, indiscretions, numerous personal and professional issues, and sometimes less-than-ideal decisions. The PS4 confronts two stories, while the PS5 and PS6 are single episodes, each of which finds that Tennison is seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged, while waging war on institutions willing to sacrifice the interests of victims for greater goodness. In other words, in order to win, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, making the ever-gray PS scenarios even more cruel, and Tennison is basically waging as killers. Very good things that only get better from series to series. (B +)
