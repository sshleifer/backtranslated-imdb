This movie was an excellent act, excellently directed and generally had an excellent story. Ive had a real life experience with a boy like 'Radio'. On the soccer program in my city, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year to practice, travel and have fun with the football team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like 'Radio' should just feel that they belong to something; They need to feel that their lives are worth living. That's how 'Radio' feels, and that's why this type of program is created at my high school. This is a very touching movie that I am delighted to have brought to the big screen. My father and I loved it, and I will always remember this being a movie that tells a raging story of the goodness and kindness of humanity!
