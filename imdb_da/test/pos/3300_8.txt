I just watched this wonderfully filmed movie capturing the essence of high-brow NYC, or any metropolis in the mid-century America. The colors, <br /> <br /> cars, the clothes and the coming of women's movement. It reflects <br /> <br /> comf-friendly attitudes towards relationships between men and women in the <br /> company / world. In some ways things have changed, and in others they have not changed at all. Women will still have what men have today, but they <br /> <br /> now have all kinds of laws and equality mandates to get it to them. In my <br /> <br /> sense, beautiful women will still make men in <br /> <br /> the pursuit of their goals! The laws we now have against harassment and <br /> <br /> were all transmitted by incoherent women who wanted an equal chance to compete with more beautiful women who might be able to get positions /> <br /> based on their look and put out! The real competition is not between men and women, but women and women! I liked the movie's look and feel, but the world hasn't changed as <br /> <br /> far as the real
