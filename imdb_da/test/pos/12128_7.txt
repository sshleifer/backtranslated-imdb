A very accurate portrayal of little time mob life recorded in New Jersey. The story, the characters and the script are credible, but the play loses the ball. It is still worth seeing, especially for the strong pictures, some still with me, although I first saw it here 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things (trying to) but these things continue to go wrong, leading the local manager to suspect his end is being skimmed off, not a great place to be if you enjoy your health or life. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that introduced Joe Pesce to Martin Scorsese. Also present is the perennial screen wise guy, Frank Vincent. Strong on characterizations and images. Sound muddled and much of the play is amateurish, but a great story.
