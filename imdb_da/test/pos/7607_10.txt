I love this movie. It focuses on both issues: reality and imagination. reality because hi, we all wanted a date from the popular guy Billy. And some of us haven't been kissed yet, haven't they? Be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is because of the pain people get by teasing. and who, high school life. Remember it? Your imagination finds your true love when you are 25 and still in high school. Not really imagination but close enough! Although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a charming wonderful job, the same as the hilarious David Arquette. The people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. haven't I just repeated it? <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of the films that later generations should see. It shows reality and some non-problems for people like you and me.
