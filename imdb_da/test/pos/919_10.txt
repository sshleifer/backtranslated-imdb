I use IMDB a lot. Mainly read comments from other people about movies I have or have not seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and how I see a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when I saw it in the theater for the first time. I feel Kieslowski is one of the best instructors all the time. And I think it's his best. It was his last. I was very sad the day when I knew he was dead because we were sure we lost the chance to get something more from him. <br /> <br /> Red is just the best Kieslowski + incredible performance of Trintignant & Jacob + filmography by Sobocinski. If you haven't seen it, LOOK FOR IT !!! If you have, just come back to it !! <br /> <br /> Red: Just a masterpiece. Please, forgive my poor English! read
