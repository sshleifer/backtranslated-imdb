Another great Tom Wilkinson performance draws "Separate Lies", a 2005 film starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it is the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning, where the man (Wilkinson) thinks he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house at night they have a party, bringing the police around. It's a hit and race that killed their girl Maggies Bassett) man. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett), when he sees damage to his car. He confronts Bule who admits that he did so and promises to go to the police the next day. When James comes home, Ann is worried that he makes a big deal out of it and says she was driving the car. Of course, James is not so eager to hurry to the police. She suggests they call Bule and tell him their decision. "Oh, F___ Bule," James says. "Well, that's just that," Ann says. "I'm F___ing Bule." James's destruction is only the beginning of this well-constructed drama. Without giving away the plot, this is a good example of how gender change changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car in a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father did it? The chair. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same is true here - if it had been James who had affair and did the subsequent activities, the viewers could feel different about the story. If Ann were in James's place, it would break. As it is, it is hugely sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he loves, and Emily Watson does a beautiful job as Ann, who, when she frees herself from her lies - engages her in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - indolent, opity and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their relationship with each other, and no one is all good or all bad. There are separate lies - James, that his marriage is happy, Ann is as mentioned above - and there is an association bulb - the accident that all parties hold on. That's enough for Ann, as Maggie knows. In the end, everyone must deal with the separate lies that the individual lie uncovers. <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie.
