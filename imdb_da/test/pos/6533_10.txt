Now I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I've seen all year. And I don't mean that in a good way. This is probably the most pathetic movie I've seen for a while, but that's what makes it so much fun. you can tell that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them, they do not do so well so it gets so straight lines delivered in what should be a serious tone that comes out that looks really fun. Aaron Carter basically plays a character similar to himself in real life, and he still manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic. This movie is one of those movies where everything to be sounded seriously comes out fun, and all the things that have to be fun are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know where hard they try. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for a good laugh.
