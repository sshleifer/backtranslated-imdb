Slick, tidy and well-built old school version of how a great international thriller is to be made. It's supposed to spike a feared global terrorist known as "Carlos Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Without Limits", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA operative and his Israeli counterpart, Amos ( Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", "Sexy Beast") gets a distinguished maritime officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Heart of Music"), to become Carlos and use him on a bold plot to kill the KGB real Carlos because he took an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to Quinn here, which unfolds here (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and film photographer David Franco deliver another big asset in the film here with Hitchcockian-like excitement and amazing sights in the world.
