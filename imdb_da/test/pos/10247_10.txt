Some people might call "Cooley High" the same kind of thing as "American Graffiti", but I wouldn't. Initially, in "AG" all were white, while those in "CH" were all black. In addition, this has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The film deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments we see that there is never any father around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest. One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other black people's pictures is that teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. Two really fun scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie. But in general, the main star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in fact of the word.
