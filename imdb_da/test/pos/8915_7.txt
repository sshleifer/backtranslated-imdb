Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I saw it. And I found it fun! Foreigners, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... my God, it was a sight. And all these desperate foreign women need is seed from the ground. <br /> <br /> And where do they look? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And this is where the greatest fun comes from: In Europe (and more in German-speaking countries) Bavaria is considered a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the foreign women. Now there have been films that people are not able to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has achieved is a true, fun pastime. You constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas. But it was 1974, and looking back 35 years, one fills with a kind of nostalgia. You've never seen a movie like that. <br /> <br /> And if you don't mind seeing the relaxed bristles and breasts, take it once. It's a comedy in essence, not a porn girl.
