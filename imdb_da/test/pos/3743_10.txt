Oh yes! Hollywood remembers how to use the good old formula, and when the lightning strikes, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. Rarely Hollywood creates a masterpiece because at last minute there seems to be more concern about hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a quick way, or there are too many chefs in the mix. Usually good screenshots are the result of a talented writer who is in complete control of his / her property, understands his material and is a good writer. Then there is a small important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses, who so often lack creativity and vision: a good actor. A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre semi-cooked trial and a fully-realized film that may not be an important and relevant movie, but one that contributes to its genre and possibly becomes a classic of its kind. We get very few romantic comedies, and we are people starving for them. Buried in the sexy humor of "Sex in the City" is the romantic but stormy relationship between Big and Carrie, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because it had some romance skillfully played by Streep and Brossnam. It could have a stupid musical, but it affected us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" gives us more of it, with the amazing talents of a woman doing great work in romantic movies, Ms. Diane Lane. Ever since her days as a children's actor, we appreciated how her talent combined with her valued soul allowed us to look into the heart's history. A few years ago, she joined with Mr Gere, who gave us a plagued, romantic and sexy performance as the wife, who is not quite sure of the consequences of her actions in "cheating," which should have earned her at least one Academy Award. She is back, doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic outlook, and suddenly she realizes that there may be a chance again around the corner. <br /> <br /> Wife. Lane makes this movie pulsed with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions communicate volumes about the various emotions that her character undergoes. We can read frustrations, longings, desperation, anger, hope, loss, and a reach far out of many of the negotiable types that Hollywood is constantly pushing into our throats. Here is a mature performer who has the gift of projecting real feelings and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Wife. Lane is such a triumphant joy to see as she goes through transformations from the movie's first scenes to the end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate her with the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unmatched joy of a person in love, just as a teenager does, and yet she never lets you think of her character as stupid or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive beads that can move the cynical in the audience. She is one of the stars who can do wonders with just a look. In her, the classic feeling of the big movies yesterday is back. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters. We admire the amazing actresses who recreate the legends of reality and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mysticism of the characters they imitate; But as much as anyone can make you think, it is the role of Lane's in this movie, which is a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, given a personal imprint and capable of achieving heights without any prior theater material support, such as playing and the background of a famous legend, whose life is a tribute to the silver screen. Lane character is a woman whose experience could be any of us. She represents our dreams and feelings of high quality, class and just the right amount of atmosphere. It is quite a remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we can still find such a remarkable achievement today. <br /> <br /> There are a few adjectives I could use to pay tribute to her work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion, every single frame of her work in this movie is a will to one of the greatest performances ever laid on celluloid by a living practitioner. Thank you, Mrs Lane.
