Is Thursday an original movie? Heck no, but it's very fun! I just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was a fun flick. I was expecting a lot, but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really liked the first set in the grocery store), some entertaining stories told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown into the mix too. Some good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova, were good, and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who has impressed me further in your friends and neighbors and Erin Brokovich). So if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun, go ahead and check out Thursday.
