A true sudsy soap opera here like Spencer Tracy tackles an illiterate's role up to 20 years. He marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success. <br /> <br /> Success but not happiness here. A n'eer-do-well son and an insidious marriage leads to disaster and tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only in a catastrophic railroad strike and death of 406 workers. <br /> <br /> Initially, the movie seemed to be uneven but rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here. <br /> <br /> A double separate suicide here. We know that wealth cannot buy happiness, but it is a little too far fetched. Nevertheless, we have easier performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore. Mrs Vinson, as a second wife, is also quite effective.
