This is an incredible movie that begins slowly. It brings you along to think of it as a typical maudlin family drama. So in the second half there is a plot twist that completely transforms this into a deep story of global scale. <br /> <br /> If you're not accustomed to film from India, with song and dance routines apparently grafted for no reason, stick to this movie. Especially starting with the second half you will find this movie a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I have only one complaint with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and lacked the opportunity to bring the war as a force that transforms people's lives. It was implied all the time, but there should have been something about the importance of the fight for MDS.
