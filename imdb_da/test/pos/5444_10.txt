When taken as a whole for her ideas and dissection of the current 2-party system and political process, I think it's a good movie. Encouraged the movie was not the comedy I had expected, but when I came over, the movie really made me think. So much of what we see and hear about choices is such a joke. There is especially a debate scene in this movie which I felt was a masterful criticism of our political debates and how policies are being discussed on them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to watch this movie. If you want something to laugh at, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual self. In this movie, they show us that the truth hurts, not the truth is fun.
