Honestly I don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. It encloses the elements of the original as they expand on them. The storytelling has been updated and some of the episodes seem to be a bit "fast", that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easy as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept of timelords being destroyed - no more political with the doctor as president emeritus. And it adds something to the sign that is the only one left. <br /> <br /> The SFX is excellent - especially in relation to the original. Take it from me (And I was a giant dr Who geek - I actually took notes while I watched the show right from Dr Number 1 to Dr. 8. I threw the horrible movie out of the gun. Personally) This is the best movie fi on TV right now, possibly ever. Watch it and buy the DVD.
