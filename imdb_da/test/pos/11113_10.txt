"Fame" had been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just an 80's musical movie of "that" high school in NYC, it's LEGENDARY - people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts, but "The Fame School"! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the school's four years, which begins with a strong monologue of a student at Auditions and concludes with a spectacular graduation show. There are apparently some who find the Broadway show better, but it is my opinion that you should definitely watch this movie anyway and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys watching movies and wants to have the "classics" down, this is certainly one of them. It is an example of one of the movies that was really good, with actors we loved for the 2 hours, and then never saw them again ... they are classic "Fame students". <br /> <br /> FAME lives forever.
