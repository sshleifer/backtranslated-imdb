For those who still prefer movies that focus on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see. <br /> <br /> By training spotlights on their own family, Block covers terrain that is unlimited for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamics and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the movie is anesthetically low key at first. <br /> <br /> In addition to providing an exploratory look at a family - and by extension, each family - Block has also crowned a very specific period in recent history. I do not know if this was intentional but inevitable because of archive content. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
