I watched this movie when it was released, and it is undoubtedly what touches the heart. I liked the view of a child who came to know that what she was thinking of her was actually not true. It is a hug for the young child. And her search to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her foster mother. It is a beautiful view. A R Rahman adds his stress through a good resume and songs. In this movie, mania ratnam does not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tells the characters as they are. And that way, the film hits the audience. The pool bath in chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not perfect what it meant. Mani Ratnam is incredibly improved.
