Fantastic documentary. A movie in a movie. I am so happy Block forged after his mother's death. Make one wonder about time and money spent in therapy. What could have happened if she didn't? Did the therapist help her or just promote an addiction that kept her bank account flushing? The audience must understand that divorce was less an opportunity these days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to be trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist has ever tried to make her think about what she might have done to change her situation and free herself? Meanwhile, wife # 2 was just the opposite. She was out there and worked with her father; Ended her bad marriage, relied and seemed to be a very confident, giving person. Whatever marriage has done, Blocks did something by raising 3 children who could look at their parents' history, be ok with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.
