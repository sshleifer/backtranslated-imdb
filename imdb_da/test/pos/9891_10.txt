I understand "Check Out" will probably be released in Theaters in the US in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is to miss "Checking out" !! This comedy film will entertain everyone who will relate to the characters, family relationships and more social issues portrayed. "Checking Out" makes you laugh all the time with fast fire smart humor built into almost any line and can make you laughing crying in a touching positive way too. The suicide is treated in a comical way, which can at the same time help people who are considering it, understand the effects this action can have on their lives, and on those who love them. Let us hope that "Checking Out" can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from acting, especially in the 16-25 age group with the highest suicide rate in the United States. The script is wonderfully written, perfectly molded and loaded with synchronous and meaningful flashbacks in time, the significance of which becomes more evident throughout the film and especially at the end. I think the script is worth an Oscar nomination for "Best Manuscript, Play for a Movie" (The Phoenix Film Festival is called "Checking Out" with a "Best Screenplay Award"). <br /> <br /> The cast is packed with great actors performing themselves, and has a long list of great performances, acting nominations and winnings. I feel that Peter Falk's "Checking Out" performance is worthy of an Oscar nomination and is the most challenging and broad range of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a "Best Actor Award". Even the teenagers in the film shine and are played by acting phenomena Dan Byrd (Movie: A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff, 3 Young Artist Award Nominations, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV: Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, Touched by an Angel , 2 Young Star Nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and Producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelationship, and the history of this entertaining, comfortable but complex script. <br /> <br /> File editing keeps the pace of the movie moving fast, only appropriately slowing down the exciting scenes, so the audience will never lose interest from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie, you can take the whole family to see and everyone will enjoy it.
