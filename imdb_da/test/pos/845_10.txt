I'm sorry to see that it has been rated as low by many people. The series started very well, and after the first season it was not so good. People tend to forget about the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the overall, not the end result. It is boring that many of the "common" characters died, but the hell, we had many great new characters. <br /> <br /> Don't tie yourself to a few characters, but tie yourself to the series plot. Please understand that I didn't like it when Boone died when Augur died, but well ... it has to be done. Can you imagine everyone still living the whole series when they are in great danger all the time? Come on, see if they didn't die, they would be invincible. In this way you will always keep the excitement, will he survive, will he die? I realize that people attach themselves to signs, I do too. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could get into every computer he wanted. He was the one who was mysterious, he could do things with the computer that no one else could do. <br /> <br /> I want to make a statement to all the people who vote negatively, do a series that started so well deserves to have such a low rating? Should we look at the last season instead of the total? Shouldn't we see how good the series was when it started? Shouldn't we see how much we enjoyed it?
