Brad Pitt holds his forefinger in Diane Krugers leg ulcers and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Fun, terrible it. The invented yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" for a ride and sometimes surrenders it to celebrate other films. Lots of fun. Even "Paris when it sizzles" is mentioned in a nice organic piece of dialogue. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational achievements. Brad Pitt creates a genuine original. I love the actors' lack of vanity. There's a fun character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe, however. fortunately his hand. his brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
