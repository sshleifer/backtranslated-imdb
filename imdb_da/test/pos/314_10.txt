I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I have never been tired of it, as it is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore. <br /> <br /> Recently, I have finally seen the naked documentary about the film's production (Hearts of Darkness: A filmmaker traveling in madness), I am even more amazed that this film is even finished but yet alone so big. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed this movie in Phillipine's jungle is the movie's greatest asset. You actually feel like your in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing with my favorites, still Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning !!") Martin Sheen and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the movie becomes too dark, strange and cerebral at the end. Well, what Coppolla said about this movie, "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" What he thinks is that this movie is about MADNESS and not the war. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on the short story "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad and set against the Vietnam War instead of the Civil War as in the book. I think it was an excellent combination in my opinion. This is perfect, challenging movie that is dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every way possible. <br /> <br /> rating: <br /> <br /> Rating: 10
