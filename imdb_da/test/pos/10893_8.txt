This is one of my favorite James Bond games in play because: The missions are fun to play, they have lots of action in them, they can be hard to make them fun to make the weapons you use are good . The way James Bond sees in this James Bond game is beautiful that you can see the piercing in him, which is cool and all the other characters in this game are similar to the actors who played them in the movie. There is no way that you can't enjoy playing this game, I loved it. Also the game follows the movie virtually a few added things, but it basically follows the movie. Also, this James Bond game has pretty good graphics for the Nintendo 64 and to bad there was no voice over players in this game, but who cares as long as the game is fun to play. <br /> <br /> Total score ** ****** out of **********
