Most of Kieslowski's film seems like a puzzle for me, with the aim of expanding mind and soul. The signs are not very credible, are idealized, are schematic. Nevertheless, the way Kieslowski presents their winding paths through life, their complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (will) believe in God. That at some point it all has a meaning, if not for me, then destined for someone. Trois Couleurs and especially "Rouge" come closer to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth" of the "meaning" than maybe any other of his movie. The only problem explored by the "puzzles" is a bit like his other films, and at some point they are somewhat predictable. There is still plenty of joy to be here. It's like a well-known wine brand - you know what to expect and it delivers, sometimes with a newly found bouquet that can come from aging - either the wine or yourself.
