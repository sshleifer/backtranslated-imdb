This is easily one of the best films from the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance, and Elmer Bernstein's music score is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of the drug addict Frank go cold turkey, this is a ripping movie! With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very poor performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptile shooter and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal. Beware of Bad Prints: This movie is in the public domain, so some copies are pretty rough.
