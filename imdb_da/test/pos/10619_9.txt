Be Prepared for the Journey to Haneke's "La Pianist" ... The protagonist's psychological illness, which Huppert plays wonderfully, goes beyond any limit you might expect. The most amazing part of it is that you start to feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash sexuality (though not nudes scenes), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us a raw meal, heavy to digest; sometimes the only way you can escape extremism on some scenes is to start laughing at it. "Mise a scene" may not be the most appealing part of the movie, it has obvious austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian notes: static, long scenes, but never boring. The Vienna settings, the French language that does, all look like a European mix. The permanent Germanic Music Background (Schubert) is beautifully selected. Above all, both Cannes Best Actress Awards are well-deserved: one of the year's greatest achievements by one of the greatest French actresses ever.
