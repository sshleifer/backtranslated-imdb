one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> * We are not done with you with a long shot * so not only Shylock gets his pound of meat, or 3000 or 6,000 or 36,000 (each of the 6 parts was a ducat) ducats, in a matter of minutes he is destroyed by lose all his belongings. and his daughter has long left him already. Revenge is a bowl that is served cold. But Shylock's attempt at revenge is back. <br /> <br /> I suppose this game was and is popular because it fits the desire we have for justice. But the hard reality is that the world is excited about injustice and most of it stands. a few big names are thrown into prison, small gang punks lose their grass to the 'good boys', but in reality most of the time it is the other way around. <br /> <br /> but not in this game. The long shelves of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it could have been another social exclusion group that gets comeuppance, it's just that the money of the time lenders were Jews, and therefore the line of history of Shylock puts the Jew into the role of the villain. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my 3rd favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 is Hamlet and Macbeth. This production provides excellent treatment of the morality of history. The scenes with alone are worth seeing. Also, the new husbands' awkward scare and minimize the fact that they let the rings slip so easily that they have sworn to last forever. In fact, this trick is the thing that spouses use diligently to remind their better half that the promises must mean something and not be made passionate. There is far far greater importance for this game than just comedy / dramatic aspect. It is about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> worth seeing again and again.
