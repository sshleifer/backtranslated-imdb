Remember - before there was Sidney, there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is hardly recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound films was the end of the 1920s and throughout the 1930s. Apart from a greater performance: The ship's good natured, if a doctor's doctor in 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are hardly revived. More is a shame because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play the villain) opposite Ricardo Cortez Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, he also played the recording song in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role Sidney Greenstreet tackled between two worlds a decade later. Digger could be pleasant and lovable (that ship's doctor again) or abominable (in CHINA SEAS, when the convicting first mother sneaks on poor Lewis Stone, but then he proves he is such a big sweep in a crisis). He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper in the GENERAL DAY OF THE DAY. Digges could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and twentieth head of a reform school sent by Frankie Darro and his friends to commit a robbery and injured a Greek-American store owner (this is the latest incident for most of them). Digges are as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it is a close thing to not really like him. He is able to somehow transcend his roles ... more later on. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of townspeople (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shaking down car owners to pay them to "see and protect" their cars. When a guy does not want to do that, they will easily destroy his car. Snatch and grabber in the store of the Greek-American is also quite graphically shown - his skull is broken when pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are rounded and brought before strict but decent judge Arthur Byron who understands that he cannot leave the children with their parents: the parents cannot see them or are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racist stereotypes in this order: a Jewish father who is more concerned about his business than with his son Farina's stereotypical "Yassum" father and the Italian father, whose willingness to cooperate, gets his son out of the reform school. <br /> <br /> When boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak for them. But Digges has no time to coddling. His is a regime that is determined to break the boys so that they behave themselves. Unfortunately, Digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. They have earned subordinate food for the boys and pocketing the profits. <br /> <br /> One day, a new government official comes to see the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he couldn't get the Park Commissioner's post), Cagney was made an assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanging girl and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Digges were a little more cautious, Cagney would probably have let him continue to run things. But Cagney is going to see Darro brought to Digges to fight. Warden and Darrow have had problems with respect earlier, and Digges now intends to punish Darro who is flying - but is severely injured by Digge's barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darro's injuries. And she explains the reality of the situation for Cagney and her own idea of ​​real reform of the boys by building trust in them with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film follows this to the end and shows that Cagney and Evans are on the right track and making the Reformation a "republic" for the boys to run properly. This leads to conflict with Digges whose profits are reduced as he no longer gets supplies. But the scheme is tracked when Cagney finds himself in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees its potential and takes it fully. But then he goes too far ... far more than he ever negotiated. <br /> <br /> The 1930s had many films showing that children took steps to correct and change things. Darro appeared as a WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did this day and age, where the kids learn a lesson for a gangster played by Charles Bickford who scares hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. HELLEN'S MAYOR reaches a similar revenge and juvenile justice search. But that's the only problem in the movie. Digg's character is a scarce and hypocritical, so we never look forward to him, but if he was not a thief, we can go along with his vision (even though it is counterproductive). The scenes at the start of Darro and his gang prying on people who actually make the hard Digges would follow seem quite understandable (though his hesitations are not). Also, he has a moment when he is rightly angry at Cagney - at that time hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a long distance phone to an immersed digger. When Digges learns what has actually happened, he is rightly angry at Cagney and presents him with proper behavior. It's the closest thing to making Mr Thompson sympathetic to this fine movie.
