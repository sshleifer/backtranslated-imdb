This is my favorite Kung Fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, seasoned with a creepy music score (traditionally Chinese instruments I believe), and some wonderfully exaggerated melodramatic moments opposite of heavily touched comedy. In fact, the Chinese tried to create their own "Western" (ie Cowboy movie) genre, a brand new animal, characterized by Kung Fu fighting and the associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers of Death is simple, a revenge story (to kill a loved one) and the pursuit of the protagonist to master the "iron fist technique" that will allow him to propagate holy revenge on his enemies. There is even a love interest, although the awkward, polite nature (found in most Chinese films during the period). However, the end result is fantastic and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
