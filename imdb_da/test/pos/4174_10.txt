What can I say about this movie, which has not been said by all the other comments here, they sum up pretty much everything, the people who love it, cherish it, the people who hate it ... yes, they scare the. This is the movie equivalent of Marmite. I have personally committed every second to memory, it is cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical and stands as one of the most unique movies ever made. Despite what many have said, I think it's really a cult movie, it's a diamond in the rough that just waiting to be discovered when it is steeped in, it's amazing psychedelic images and incredible soundtracks become unforgettable, which is a performance in itself. One of my friends who saw it looked more like a musical and in many respects to those who did not fully appreciate the context in which this movie was made, would probably get more out of it to see Head as such. <Br /> <br /> I was always fond of Monkees, especially the TV show back when it was repeated during the 80s. My mother had recorded Head for me as it was shown on two late night when she knew I liked them, I saw it one day later and it was filed in my memory until I could find a copy on DVD About two decades later, what I would love now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to gain a greater insight into the presentation of this masterpiece. We can only hope.
