That's exactly what I expected from it. Relaxing, humorous and entertaining. The acting couple were fantastic, as well as the stage selection. I personally recommend this. It is a kind of movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This sweet movie will make you smile and laugh as well. And the action scenes are tasty. Classics of modern American comedy. And very well done.
