Further adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly pick up where the Egg and I relax. For the first solo adventure of the boilers, a new writing team and instructor are introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was the producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses, MacDonald's focus on boilers works very well. There is a reference to Ma who beat Birdie Hicks for the first time at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I. The prize money from quilt competition was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this movie, Tom returns home as a college student. <br /> <br /> There are two charts intertwined in this movie. One is comedy from the simple mountain family moving into a modern modern house. The other is an easy moral game about how the environment affects children as they grow up. Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco bag to compete and ended up winning a house. His disappointment by not getting the free tobacco bag is being played for a laugh. When Pa plays with dynamite, he is completely unaware of the explosion. Kilbride never flinched on stage when the waste from the explosion fell around him. He played part to perfection. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's lethal delivery. Kilbride took the comic unit to a high level. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Main) and Dad move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. Ma adjusts much faster than Pa. Included with the modern conveniences is a television, a brand new household item in 1949. Floating walls, hidden beds and plumbing fixtures are used as comics, but attention is paid to Ma and Pa, never the props themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. Tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This topic is briefly discussed in a few scenes, but left to decrease. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise spinning film. Seeing that the boilers are moving out of their worn-out old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the signs that remain true to themselves. Ma was the practical, as she had been in the egg and I. Pa was the fish out of water that gave the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual placement of a comfortable bed would never be worried about him.
