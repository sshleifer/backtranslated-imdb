The captain and Tennille have released a very good 3 DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most exhibition versions, these shows have not been hacked to bits. The musical and dance tracks are included in the sketches, just as they were at the first broadcast. I suppose some music tracks on the DVD may have been edited for shows where they were not originally shown but could not confirm this suspicion. I've noticed some discrepancies between what's on the DVD and the program information I've found on the web. I have not been able to check if the network information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited at the shows on the DVD. Whatever the truth may be, I am very grateful for the production work. I want every black exhibit to show the same respect for the format. I guess about half of the shows are included. I think they ran into the rights on the shows that were not included. Hopefully these problems can be solved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance exercise among the extras. I recommend this DVD to any C&T fan.
