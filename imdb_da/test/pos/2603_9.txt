The four signs on the road say "If you're looking for fun ..... You don't need a reason .... All you need is a gun .... It's rabbit season!" <br /> <br /> In the forest we see hundreds of "Rabbit Season" characters released on each tree. We see more and more characters pointing exactly at Bugs Bunny's hole. Who makes all these signs up? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away, and tells us, the audience: "Awful unsporting of me, I know. /> <br /> From that time on we see Elmer Fudd, shotgun in his hand ..... and a war with semantics between Bugs and Daffy with Bugs winning every time. Only in cartoons, fortunately we can see someone get shotgun-blasted in the head five times and continue!
