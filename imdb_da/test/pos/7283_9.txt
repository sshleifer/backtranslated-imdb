Good movie, all elements of a good movie were there, history, actors, script and direction. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. <br /> <br /> No doubt it is a low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his incredible wife. Saw a voice in the phone and then just fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and offers a powerful performance. She is an excellent part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the increasing ambiguity near the end, although we know that the protagonist may be involved, we continued to see everything from his point of view and ask: Who is the killer?
