Jack Palance, (John Witting), was usually a bad guy in most of his films and in this movie he showed his great acting talents beyond my expectations. John Witting returns unexpectedly to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken (Jacob) has difficulty trying to accept his father's appearance after he has spent the night in the family chair. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him as he is, a very old man, at the end of his rope. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), joins in the character of John Witting and begins to highlight the truth of what happened to him in his years of absence from the family. This is a very warm and loving film on earth about real events happening in most families in the generations to come.
