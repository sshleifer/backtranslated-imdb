Let me first admit that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so I may unfairly lead my caviler to the director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is definitely a movie worth a while, but you get very confused at the end. The Colonel was a fraud used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for himself); or the Colonel was not a fraud but used as the aforementioned by the lawyer; Or did the lawyer really try to earn the honest colonel? The director and / or editor seems to have deliberately hidden these issues, which do not look like Balzac, the realist. At the same time, the film does an excellent job of delimiting the characters, if not their motives, and casting and production are fantastic. The open battlefield scene is bound to haunt one's dreams. Still, one wonders by the all-too-common feeling among contemporary filmmakers to favor ambiguity above all else. Weren't the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
