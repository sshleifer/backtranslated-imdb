I gave it only a seven because the play is good. And of course I mean Wilkinson. The other two principles were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behave like martin Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an unbearable jerk that I asked for an extremely brutal and prolonged death. Who am I making fun? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany. So what on EARTH saw SE Emily Watson's (Anne) character in him ???? She even admitted that he was quite a piece of offal in his treatment of her. Why would she even be in the same city as him, not to say something about the same "room". <br /> <br /> I noticed some other reviews someone said she "cried" at the end to witness James's tragedy. ??? WHAT tragedy? What do you think you lose an imbecile who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break.
