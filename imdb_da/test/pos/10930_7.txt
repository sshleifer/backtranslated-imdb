The mere presence of Sam Waterston as Indians is enough to put this movie into the must-see category. He is both beautiful and very subtle, with no lines at all. He is tender with his kidnapper, and yet we can see that he is among the proudest of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a stupid cluck who chooses to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a beautiful white horse. Other subplots are really unnecessary. I do not understand the role Caroline Langrishe plays as the poor girl kidnapped by White Bull ... I do not know how to keep her hands away from this beautiful Indian man! However, it is very fun; especially if you are a Waterston fan. Man, he looks good in this one !!! Harvey Keitel's role is not even worth mentioning to tell the truth! But rent it and enjoy it! In fact, I think if the music score was better, it would have been a more dramatic movie ... the music is so bad it's distracting. Still - that's Mr. Waterston!
