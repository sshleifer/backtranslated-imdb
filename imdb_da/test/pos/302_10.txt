I decided to extend my review for my all-time favorite movie. Unlike other war movies focusing on the event, the Apocalypse Now takes the viewer in a psychological tour. The pure surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can't put your eyes out of it. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the Apocalypse now slowly breaks down his protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, probably as Kurtz fell mad. The production of this film is notorious for its delays from the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A film-maker Apocalypse, showing hell, all went through with this. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any movie. As the helicopters' leaves are heard in slow motion and napalm has fallen into the trees, the song "The End" at the Doors can be heard. The next shot is Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the helicopter's noise coincides with the fan. We are informed that he is doing special missions for the military, mostly murder. When his next mission is given to him, he is amazed. "Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speed ticket in the Indy 500." The man he must kill was a respected colonel who has gone mad and isolated himself with the people of the tribe. Kurtz orders horrible actions performed by these people and he must stop me. Willard does not go alone. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers, and they come across several battles. Along the way, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore meets "Hoorah" about the war. Willard thinks that if Kilgore is so crazy, what could Kurtz be like. There are many scenes depicting Willards, obscure in insanity: Tiger attacks, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the unstopped rain, the stacked dead bodies scattered, and the death of his crew members. When he reaches the Kurtz connection, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photo journalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz immediately, Willard begins talking to him, and his conscience begins to doubt what to do. Kurtz, on the other hand, will die. He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in harmony, sacrificing a buffalo with several machetes by the people. When they realize that their leader has been beaten instead of killing Willard, they greet him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography here is amazing. The colors are grain-free, something that is rare in older films. I can see it subdued and admire the beauty of nature. <br /> <br /> The working ensemble is great, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he is neglecting his role as a depressed lunatic who is struck by the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and score are joking and giving the mood to the movie. I wonder which instrument they used in the guitar-like sound when the credits rolled? There have been many parodies of this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains Homer why a character with the same name on a police game behaves like an idiot: "Your character gives cartoon help to the show, like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. "Those who have seen the movie know why it's fun.
