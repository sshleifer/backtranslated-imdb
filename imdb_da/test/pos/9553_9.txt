Rented the video for a slow Saturday night. First View I thought it was fun. Took a while to get used to the American caricatures (here we are more aligned to British grotesques) but very comfortable. <br /> <br /> Then again next night and really warmed to it. The characters seemed more human - lovable, though. A movie you could see several times and get more out of it every time. But my wife * hated it. No bill for taste in humor I suppose.
