I first saw this movie in video form. Even on a TV screen, the view was impressive. Seen on the big screen in its full glory, it must have blown people away. As one or two other comments have pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and how they came about the terrain problems, etc. on the way to Oregon is as authentic as any movie can be. It therefore shows that it is completely unnecessary to take liberties with the truth - something that today's filmmakers should take care of - the reality is enough. The reason is dependent on man's struggle against the elements and hostile natives. Subplots are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere I have gone through Paramount's rival to the big track, Fighting Caravans. Despite having a more sophisticated plot, and with better actors, tanks lack the amazing scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail should be mandatory viewing.
