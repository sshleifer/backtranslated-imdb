Who said it should be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience much more. You will find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and just accept it for what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "dubious elements" in a children's movie for once. That for me is worth the price of the ticket. And it succeeds in maintaining its health without being obvious about it - the older chidler will enjoy this movie. Enough good humor to keep adults interested. Very good movie.
