It is worth dwelling on the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities - wise Sita, who cares for Lakshmi and the Kali Transformer - as well as three main male deities - Tomb Rama, Playful Krishna and Shiva the End - are all referred to. Knowing the folklore as surely all Indian members of an audience gives a wealth to the story of today's history. In fact, a folktale is first issued on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the film's "real life". "Brand" speaks to misogyny and homophobia in the society in which its producers reside, and it does so with a beauty that evokes the message in several levels of viewers' attention, making it a profoundly satisfactory presentation. This is the finest movie I've seen in the last ten years; highly recommended!
