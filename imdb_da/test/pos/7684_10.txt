When is ART going to overcome racism? I think the American people have grown up since this movie was made. Porgy consists of a cast and music. This movie image is an excellent adaptation of a large opera. i.e. Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera has been introduced here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly. AND OPERA !! So be it !! <br /> <br /> Disney hesitates to release song in the south. The NAACP has not expressed any competition for race problems and let us not forget Amos N Andy was a big hit in the 50s as a television series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the United States and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE RELEASE 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
