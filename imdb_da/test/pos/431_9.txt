I made a promise that if I ever wrote a comment that was less than free so later felt different about it, I would come back and get acquainted with my heartbeat. So far this is the first time it has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The reason may still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. <br /> <br /> Not all shows can get out of the starting gate of a winner. Some need time to pick up speed. I'm glad I continued to see this program and I really hope it lasts.
