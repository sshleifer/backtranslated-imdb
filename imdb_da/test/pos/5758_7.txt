I had looked for this movie so long before I found it I had seen it when I was younger and loved it, after my second viewing, I still loved it and I still do. <br /> <br /> This is a love / hate movie, if you like the bottom, the young, the cartoon, then you'll find it fun. If you don't like that kind of humor, then you won't bother. I love this movie and have grown up with these comedy programs, for me this movie is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen. It is not an award winning in any way, but if you just want a good healthy slapstick, then it is! <br /> <br /> The movie lacks the quality of the TV series, and that is usually the case with movies, but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even though many of the jokes are similar to their previous work. <br /> <br /> Yes, humor is a little childish and not to everyone's taste, but sometimes you just need it in a movie.
