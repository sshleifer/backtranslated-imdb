This is a masterpiece. 'The Big Snit' is a crazy, weird, fun and ultimately touching look at an old spouse and their quiet life, arguing to look and scrabble while a nuclear war rages outside. Everything in this great animated card stands out as memorable: The wife's eyes shake, the vacuuming binge, the man's fetish (watch these backgrounds!), The highly verbal cat, the denied game show, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" accesion serenade and the moving and memorable end. I'm so glad I found 'The Big Snit', which is down one of the greatest works of film ever produced.
