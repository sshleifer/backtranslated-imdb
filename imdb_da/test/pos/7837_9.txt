I found the episodes to be fascinating and well-written. As a television show, it was entertaining, which is what I expect from fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the professor and his female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a little difficult to understand what she is saying. I hoped there would be more than four episodes. I acknowledge that a commentator / reviewer of this series had comments regarding his opinion as a doctor. I understand the comments of this gentleman; However, this is a fictional television series intended to entertain ... not presenting precise facts like a documentary. Patrick Stewart does well and makes his character credible. If you want to see a documentary then this is not the series for you. But if you want to see unique scientific theories in an entertainment-based medium, then you will enjoy the four episodes.
