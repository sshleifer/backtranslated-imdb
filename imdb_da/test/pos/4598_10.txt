I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this movie because I just saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I don't think so for everyone, because basically it is Kafka's "The Trial" encounter "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. Still I thought it was great. If you want to see it because you want a successor to Office Space, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-impoverished and hilariously honest looking where our society is heading, you're out for a treat. I only saw the 8 pm show opening night in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the movie is likely to be gone for a week. It's really a shame because idiocracy in its own way is one of the best satiries to come together for a while. But then again, it basically makes fun of the people who make up about 99% of the film's audience, so I don't think it's strange that the studio panicked and tried to dump it.
