Anthony Wong plays Lok, a man whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok-because of his illness he has long gone without sex. Therefore, he is plagued by a number of cunning nightmares with nurses and school girls. "Erotic Nightmare" is a fun Cat III flick filled with sleaze and voyeurism. There is also a bit of fun as the first part of the movie shows some nasty killings by Wong character under the influence of the monk's mysterious forces. The dream sequences are pretty erotic Of course, those who expect a cruel cat III horror in the tradition of "Serial Killer Diary" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but fans of poorly-used cinema should give one a look.7 out of 10th
