I saw 'I smell the dead' - sorry, 'I sell the dead' - by a press screening. Glenn McQuaid, the film's author-director-editor, is a ridiculous Irish who introduced the screening by stating that - while it was underway - he would 'go for a pint'. I do not desire him a drink, but - by telling us about it - he felt that he had to certify his ridicule or his Irishness, or both. When the opening credits rolled, there were - as usual at press screening - loud ovations for the names of all actors or crew members who had friends in the audience and silence for those who didn't. McQuaid returned to a witty Q&A afterwards. <br /> <br /> This horror movie does not take itself seriously, which is good because its humor is considerably stronger than its horror. Only one scene is even extremely scary, and most of the horror is only widespread, but I laughed the whole movie. This movie seems to be set in Ireland approx. 1850 (at what time digging was mostly interrupted). The story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks within flashbacks, and the narrative character recovers material he couldn't know, sometimes he wasn't present or (in one case) because the action unfolds behind his back. br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in the 19th century in Ireland, but for one time we actually see a likely guillotine sequence. The prisoner struggles on the way to execution, the rope clamps are correct and the prisoner manages to look up to see the magazine overhead. (And there is a payoff later to justify the historically incorrect use of the guillotine itself.) The people are apparently Irish, but a big sign speaks in the Cockney slang: using sentences such as "a mug" and "take a butcher" (for to see a look). For once, actors in the twentieth century's roles show dental hygiene from the 19th century, but almost all clothing and hairstyles (and the woman's makeup) are resolutely the 21st century. I'm not complaining in the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that seems to be PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main players (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the supporting casts have no meaning for the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as the audience whose characterization is strongly rooted in the 21st century. Just as I thought Garland's performance couldn't get any less Victorian, he used his fingers to make "ironic" quotes. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially Angus Scrims lab) are detailed and impressively failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in those places. Almost every interior contains burning candles, but never once did I see what would have been there if they were actual Victorian homes or workplaces: remaining drips from previous candles. One scene has a soil landscape: You were annoyed that McQuaid plumped for a stereotypical "gray" Schwa alien, rather than something original. <br /> <br /> There are great montage sequences, but McQuaid chooses for flashy effects - split-screens, overhead shots - not earning history. I was impressed by a recurring blue screen device that overlaid the main characters' heads over other backgrounds. Less effective was a recurring 'Creepshow' style motif of camera images morphing the actors' faces into drawings that resemble panel art from the 1950s EF horror comics. I am a fan of EC Comics, but they do not belong in the 19th century in Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on flashy photo F / X - showing his editing abilities without operating history - should have been used on precise costumes. <br /> <br /> BIG SPOILERS NOW. Ron perlman gives an "oirish" performance full of acting tics. He plays an Irish priest from the 19th century, he writes with his left hand. (In the Victorian Ireland, the left-handed children were punished for using the "devil's hand" and were forced to retrain for justice.) But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere, a character is bitten by a zombie, but has no negative effects, so I knew there would be a payoff later. Several scenes, which were more logical at night, were shot in daylight, apparently only because it was lighter and cheaper. (As McQuaid is an accomplished instructor and editor, he could easily have shot "day by night" ... but by using a process photographic effect that helps to tell the story, he seems to interest him much less than showing his flashy editing techniques.) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to be the tribute to the great old Hammer horror flicks. But the hammers were so big because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 Whitechapel, or anywhere. 'I sell the dead' almost completely fails to evoke the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuaid shows talent as an instructor, script and editor, yet in all three capabilities he makes unequal choices ... so largely failing to justify these choices. But I enjoyed 'I sell the dead'. I will rate it 7 out of 10, and I'm looking forward to his next movie.
