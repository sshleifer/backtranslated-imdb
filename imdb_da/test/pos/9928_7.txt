Betty is like an underdog in a production of Verdi's Macbeth being asked to continue when the diva is injured in a car accident. But in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play" the production seems damned problematic, not least where there are some crazy slices up the crew. Unfortunately for the killer, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of several must-see Argento food-slasher flicks, in this case primarily for the extraordinary photography of the great British cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I haven't measured it, but I estimate that about two-thirds of the shots in this movie involve either pans, puppets, tracking or cranes - the vast amount of camera processing is just amazing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. The picture is wild and dizzying - Close-ups of the heroine's eyes forced to open with nails, a sucking glide around an opera house from the point of view of an amber, shot from the murderous brainwashing, a bullet fired through a kiglehul, a swallow chain dug out of a quote of an offer . Conceptually, it is just amazing and could only be realized by this director. However, the film is not without some flaws; The cast is at best variable - Marsillach and Barberini are both a bit shaky (and his English-language dubbing is horrible, even by Italian standards), though Argento Regular Nicolodi is fun, and Charleson gives a thought-provoking performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a horror director very maligned for his distantness and dependence on technique). The material is a beautiful three-way mix of Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and Slasher Flick, written by Argento and his usual collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with sharp suspects galore and the usual contempt for boring exhibition scenes to explain what actually going . Full of all sorts of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini, and of course Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For some bizarre reason, the British version of this film has the alternative title Terror At The Opera.
