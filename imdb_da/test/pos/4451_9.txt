This film shows a serious side to it often thought of as gore-party works of fulci. Not a lot of blood and gut here, but a good story about murder and the affected lives. <br /> <br /> A true find when it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary. /> Check this out, but be warned, it's hard to find! <br /> <br /> Ron
