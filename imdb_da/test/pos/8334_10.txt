A SUPERMAN cartoon. <br /> <br /> When America unveils its colossal new bomber, JAPOTEURS hits an elite force of Japanese spies and saboteurs. Steal the sky with the pristine girl reporter Lois Lane aboard and the destination either Tokyo or destruction, it's time for Superman to get involved ... This was another in the series of outstanding cartoons originally created by Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio . They have great animation and tight, fast seats. Supposed to be shown in cinemas, they are miles ahead of their Saturday morning colleagues. Bud Collyer is the Superman's voice; Joan Alexander honors Lois Lane.
