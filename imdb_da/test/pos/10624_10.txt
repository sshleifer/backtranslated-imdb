If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains the whole in the opposite expression of its contradictions, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut is its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano student with a kind of fascist sadism, while she longs for the same for herself. Her outer expression designates her wish. That's why she likes evil without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> Along with come talented, beautiful young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted by her passion and her intensity. He wants to be her student to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent, Vienna's winter garden tunes him. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he does not want to refuse an answer and thereby begin his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect. The question that the viewer might ask at this time is who is in control? The sadistic or masochist? In fact, who is the sadist and who the masochist? It's hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been heavily abused both mentally and physically, who actually lies wounded on the floor in grotesque triumph and fulfillment, or is it the person rushing out of the door, sated, giving the order that nobody is to Know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She's a sex extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while preserving the facade of respectability. In fact, it's not even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they go in and find her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Love she calls it. For her sex and love are the same. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic such redundancy is for her. How gratuitous the comment. The film is beautifully carved and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke, who spins the story with expert camera work and carefully crafted sets, where the essence of the action is not only clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of to find the Erika inside). He also uses a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well-timed cuts from one angle to another. This is especially important in the scene where Erika, like a blood drain, caught in strong white and black light lies beneath her lover, stiff as stone. Here we mostly only see her face and the strong sketch of her neck with her pulsating artery. We don't have to look any more. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes; in fact she excels in them. I have seen her in a number of films and what she does better than almost everyone has become character and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie, she is not afraid of what others might think and care about her look in decorative style. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No signs of depraved. It is as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to see her as she does. She is always fascinating and almost flawless. She is not just a leading light of the French cinema; She is one of our great actresses of the time, who has put together an incredibly diverse working group. I think it is very educational and gives us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in Lacemaker (La Dentellière) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she was apple sweet in her red hair and fringe and her beautiful face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy of sex and modesty - just an ordinary French girl who one day hoped to be a beauty expert. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and totally depraved. <br /> <br /> Huppert is fortunate to be an actress in France where there are parts like this for women at the age of starletter. (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.) In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and toughest actresses can hope to have a career after about thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure due to her ability and reach, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La Cérémonie (1995), where she plays a silly, patient murderer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. You will not forget her or the character she brings to life.
