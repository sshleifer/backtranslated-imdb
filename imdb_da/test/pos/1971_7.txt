David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least elements of the film stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring of the organic and inorganic, itchy throbbing things that should not be squishy and throbbing. "eXistenZ" is classic Cronenberg. In short, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video screen, images of your mind are delivered. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' at the bottom of your spine, and while the game is running, the player cannot tell the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer and leads a beginner marketer, Jude Law, through the game's steps. While in the game, they reveal strange setbacks and possible crimes. But are they right or is it the game? Not even the author's author knows. <br /> <br /> The movie is a pleasure and keeps the viewer engaged but in the dark until the last minutes. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it does not rely heavily on special effects, it is the story itself that evokes the movie. Recommended for Saturday night when science fiction is required.
