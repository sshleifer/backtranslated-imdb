This was Eisenstein's first finished project for over ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of Russian by the Germans (Teutonic Knights - I think). Released in 1938, it is a very loose parallel to Russia's nearby participation in World War II and Germany's progress in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, most notable battle near the end of the movie, and there is a choke when children are thrown into a pit of fire, but it's not easy to see. The movie draws and is not as consistently brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better in clips. However, his brilliance is present and it is a "must see" for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
