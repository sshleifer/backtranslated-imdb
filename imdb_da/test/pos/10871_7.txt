Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, was formed by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent teacher, to be her own husband and say what he thinks, something that gets him in trouble at school, where we first meet him because he teaches revolutionary ideals . The island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in the European history of the 19th century. Napoleon comes to his exile, not exactly a highlight of his life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon, who writes his memoirs and needs help with his own project. The young man comes from a merchant family. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino has decided that his place belongs to Elba because he wants to kill Napoleon. Lille detests him after his mentor Fontanelli has been tried for treason and condemned for being fired by a firing team. <br /> <br /> Martino finds her comfort with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, another kind of man emerges. Napoleon is considered a more human person who truly enjoys Martino's firm and has not suspected the plans of the young person's own plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino is unable to put his design into action because Napoleon has other plans in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, the director of "Caterina va i citta", shows why his early promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with the manuscript, which is based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is so good in intimate drama as well as with this type of play. Alessandro Pesci, the filmmaker, does an excellent job with the pictures he could get. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best thing in the movie. He plays against more experienced players, but he manages to convince us that he is the idealistic youth who tries to get justice over what he perceives is a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a more subdued Napoleon than one would expect from everyone's interpretation of this greater than the life-mate. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
