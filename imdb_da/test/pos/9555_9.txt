<br /> <br /> This is the best mock documentary from a dog show I've seen for a long time. A very long time. Now let's see it ever. Isn't that part of the charm? The idea of ​​actually going into trouble making a movie that sparks a documentary about an event that most people would find strange in the first place. Even if there were no laughs, one would still ponder the thought. Any movie trying something new scores high in my proverbial book. I also loved the dogs!
