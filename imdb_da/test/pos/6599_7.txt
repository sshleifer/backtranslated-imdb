This is a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I don't like skateboarding or skateboarding. But somehow for about 2 hours, this film made me interest in the subject. I wouldn't call it the most exciting movie all the time, but for some reason, when these guys talked about how to start their skateboard clubs and skate in the empty Southern California pools I was interested in. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was also good. I'm not longing to hear more 70's rock band, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
