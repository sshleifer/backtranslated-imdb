Was excited at the opening to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal" but wanted more so I bought the Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minute music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even without the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent filmography. The opening at CERN, where "God's Particle" or Biggest Antimatter is created with STUNNING images, is an instant clue that presupposes the excellent movie. Who doesn't love Hanks? The grandiose and twists in this movie are just amazing and fun until the amazing twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfactory compromise between science and religion, although lots of closed heads will continue on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." A.Einstein
