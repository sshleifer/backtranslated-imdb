I loved this movie, the audience I was a part of loved this movie, and the little 7-year-old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at the proverbs, the visual humor and the good feeling you left the cinema when it ended. I could easily see why it was such a great success in France. I plan to buy the DVD so I can watch it again and laugh at all the bits I missed as I laugh so hard the first time.
