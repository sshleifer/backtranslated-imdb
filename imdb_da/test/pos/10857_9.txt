For every fan of upcoming age stories, this 3 hour adaptation of <br /> <br /> Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematically nods to Baz Luhrmans <br/> <br /> kinetic style, as well as to all the primary and ordinary pieces <br /> <br /> ever present on the BBC (where you've probably seen almost <br /> <br /> every prominent member of this cast). It's pretty bawdy and over <br /> <br /> the top of the spots, but that's just what the novel required. The throw <br /> <br /> is appealing, and in the case of Anna Chancellor and Hugh <br /> <br /> Bonneville, perfect. In case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine <br /> <br /> Nan, just ignore the fact that she is too beautiful to <br /> <br /> always be wrong for a boy and run with it . It's a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Some fans of the novel can be put off by the various changes in the <br /> <br /> character (especially that of Jodhi Mays character, Florence), but <br /> < The changes all work towards the greater advantage of this teleplay and <br /> <br /> provides a high quality entertainment value.
