This is a movie that has all the basics of its genre. It makes you cry, it makes you laugh, it confuses you, it makes you angry, etc. Fortunately, the subject of history is not a disease or drug, what is the common tendency of gay theme movies these days, but it focuses on the social interactions between characters, what could be considered not to be in the high school elite. The toy and the direction could be a little more sophisticated, but on the other hand it is somehow better because it really shows the distress of the characters they experience. If this were the intention, then this is a remarkable job and certainly a feat, especially for such a young director. <br /> <br /> It's actually a good story that gives you some insight into what it's like to be a fat girl and to recognize it for yourself.
