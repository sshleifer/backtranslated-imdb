I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and hearty movie. I think the effort in the film's director / author is brave and inspiring. I loved this movie not only for the amazing story (which had to be told), but also for how the actors delivered the story. This is not another superficial "gay movie" that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and flawless effort to show people who love, really know no boundaries, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotions portrayed in this movie that surround the forthcoming one of the protagonists. We must all go through similar situations that live in the society we live in and feel the feeling of secession from everything that is "right" and "normal". I commend my heartfelt praise for this amazing and courageous story.
