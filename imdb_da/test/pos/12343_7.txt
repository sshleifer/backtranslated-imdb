Julie (Meg Tilly) is a "highy two shoes" type high school girl who, determined to prove something to herself, allows herself to be exposed to the rituals of "The Sisters", a small clip presided over by snooty, homecoming queen type Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters suggest that for Julie's final test, she should spend the night in a mausoleum and prepare to drive Julie up the wall, but not knowing that the recently deceased, bad psychic Raymar is interred there and plans to cause chaos from beyond the grave. <br /> <br /> While this debut picture for Tom McLoughlin ("Friday the 13th part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes they Come Back") is limited by the obvious low budget, that's what McLoughlin and his crew can do with what counts. It's really scary, disturbing fare; It might well have scared stuffed out of me if I was under the age of 10, and even in my present age it was still to some extent. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects look cheesy, but the decent looking and gore is created by Tom Burman, an experienced makeup effects artist who, while considering being overshadowed by more famous names like Winston, Baker and Bottin, have a good resume with other movies like "Cat People" (1982) and "The Beast Within" for his credit. What I like most about it was a true sense of vanity and atmosphere, an aspect missing from some of the current trendy horror movies that appear in our multiplexer. Tilly is sweet and appealing in her role, having recently completed her debut film "Tex" before joining this production. "One Dark Night" was completed some time before the release to theaters in 1983, when it actually did decent work during the first few weeks. The other actors do what they should do well enough; Well-known faces in the support molding include the equally appealing veteran singer / actress / voice-over artist Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not * playing a kind of creature character but unfortunately ending with very little screen time and no one other than Adam "Batman" West. The director's wife Nancy, who wanted to play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives", appears here as the spacious girl in front of the arcade. It's decent B-level screaming entertainment, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not so smooth (hey, McLoughlin * was * just started), but certainly good for some chills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
