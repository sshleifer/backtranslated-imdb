Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he would like to screen screens that had an ordinary person thinking their own business, who was accidentally caught in a horrible event they can't get out of before it Bad plot behind their problems is solved. In this way, the audience can feel more sympathetic to the hero. We certainly do in this fine movie. Barry Kane is only trying to help his fellow man by making friendship and remuneration, like helping Fry pick up the letters he lost at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Fry later ... it was big money in 1943 !! It is Barry's actions of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and he is mistakenly accused of sabotage and murder and is likely to hang if he cannot clear himself. Like the 39 steps in the plot, the hero raises the landscape where he discovers plans for further terrorist acts by fascist cells, an arch-villain whom no one could believe to be a cabinet-nazi and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hate, so fall in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's trademark touches humor is also here. Patricia is a billboard model that is different road ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a trip with the bad guys all the way from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a trucker who is a one-man comedy act. "Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." Field workers in the fascist spy grouse to be forgotten or ignored by the "dragons" as if they were working for a legitimate business. During a chase scene in a movie theater, the audience's members laugh at a sklocky comedy / gangster flick, as the saboteur cell shoots it right for the good guys and accidentally kills a guffawing movie protector. Terrible for the dead old man, but fun! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movie and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as a background and ironic icon! It seems even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
