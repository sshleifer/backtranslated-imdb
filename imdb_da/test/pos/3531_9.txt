It might have been inevitable that with the start of the "slasher" film in the early 1980s, some good things could slip through the cracks. This is a great "rare" movie by Jeff Lieberman who assured his cult status with his memorable 1970s movie "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on the spot) to do some camping and check out the act for any country that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will be predictably terrorized by a voluminous killer with an incredibly horrifying grin. <br /> <br /> "Just Before Dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "arty" and intelligent than some slasher movies. Lieberman actually throws out the characters - yes, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute movie will allow him. The movie has real moments of excitement and excitement, and actually holds off graphically, saving for a killing at the start. <br /> <br /> There is an above average cast here, including Oscar's winner George Kennedy, as a forest ranger, who understandably has gone a bit flaky from being alone in the desert for too long. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, future Brian De Palma regular Gregg Henry, blonde leader Deborah Benson (it's a pity, she hasn't become a more famous performer, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin (" Sleepaway Camp ") and Jamie Rose (" Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ") round off the casting. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots are interesting and the early music score of Brad Feidel (now best known for his "Terminator" theme) is teasing and atmospheric. This is worth catching up on the important plot twist of about an hour's mark, although for a moment about 75 minutes of involving the hero and a tree and the killer is almost comical; it can actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! One of the most clever touches is the final sending of the killer, which I had never seen before in a horror movie and probably won't see again. <br /> <br /> I didn't give it 10 out of 10 because I honestly can't believe I was so scared. It is still an interesting slasher that is worth rediscovering. <br /> <br /> "That deed doesn't matter, son. These mountains can't read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
