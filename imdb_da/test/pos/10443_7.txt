This movie was released when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed. <br /> <br /> It was over 24 years ago and I haven't seen the movie since. This time around, I cut some of the actors, but still appreciate the movie for what it is. Life is not always fair, and the good guys do not always win, in fact, I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teen pricks always did better with many girls. It doesn't matter how nice you are, you can't do anyone like you. Girls / boys like who they like, no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just have to go and say the next. <br /> <br /> Gary does a great job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true for teenagers when they get fixed on someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting around with helpers laughing our asses on some of the antiques. The action is not quite there compared to the Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. Beautiful guys ending last !! Gary comes across as a beautiful lame cringe worthy material, but we all know guys like this one who are far to sensitive. We all know a David, funny guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here behind the bag, but hi end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chickens just go back to more, no matter how bad the guy treats them, especially at that age. I have experienced the first hand. <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack too !!
