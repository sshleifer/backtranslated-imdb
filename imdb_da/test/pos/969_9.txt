BIG FAT LIAR is, in my opinion, an absolute hilarious movie with a morale for it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played these tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay was mistakenly ended up in Macy's hands, fun. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo. When I first saw him, I couldn't be sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she said, "Of course!" Before I unpack it, I would like to say, "As I said earlier, there is a morality for this story and the moral is always telling the truth." In conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a morality to it.
