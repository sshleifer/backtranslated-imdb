Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission in Cambodia during the Vietnam War to murder Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has become completely insane and no longer takes orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it's hard for Capt. Willard understand how Col. Kurtz could get out of the deep end he has, kill without clearance and take the war in his own hands. What could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his goal, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do when he finds him? <br /> <br /> Any movie that can start with The Doors 'The End' is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with mood and pictures shown with the song. Apocalypse now makes it perfect. I can't think of anything better for being put on, Vietnam war, and insane in the minds of soliders as it created. AN is a dark and brutal story of a long journey through some of the sharpest jungles in Vietnam, whose ultimate destination is murder. Through the use of music and scores alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood alone through music is this movie right here. <br /> <br /> An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough action skills to spread around our film cakes. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hate for this man has risen ten times. I'm aware of this, but I don't care about it. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as colleague Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor who could have played the good man crazy and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to see as Willard and we can identify with his questions about his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie is to be Robert Duvals Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this movie, I never portrayed Duvall as a war-time cowboy, but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the whole movie, like Gung-ho Air Cavalry Commander, who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the scent of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The reason is quite simple and it doesn't take too much brain power to figure out what's happening. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, pure and simple. But it is the journey of the movie that is really the heart and also the serious situations in the war itself. In the Redux version, we have to sit through the expanded French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene, which really doesn't add anything to the movie's entirety other than making it a long journey. I don't feel they are taking anything away, but it's just a matter of whether you want to watch a movie in three and a half hours or the original. Through this voyage, the film points to the utterly vain and irrelevant war for the Americans and the massive effect it has on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, it is the whole point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public, and it might well have helped cause a sign like Kurtz 'to become completely angry. <br /> <br /> A great war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all classics. In some cases I try to compare movies of the same genre with each other, but it has got me in trouble in the past in my reviews, as I have to go back to what I have said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War .... so to say, truly, one is better than the other, is pretty pointless ... though after having had the latest. AN I think it's a bit better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in both versions and worthy of the status it has been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously said, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
