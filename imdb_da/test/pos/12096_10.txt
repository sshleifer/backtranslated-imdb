This movie is one of the most memorable movies I've seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not a very enthusiastic advocate of music documentary, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who for many years has forbidden to sing in Turkey, sings her piece, the theater was in awe. I would give my everything to hear a CD recording of this haunting, beautiful song. And she is only one of many artists interviewed and recorded and talks about their experience of performing in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember Aynur's recordings in an acoustic auditorium, and I try to remember the music as it echoes in the cinema. Well prepared for Faith Akin, film director and his good idea to capture the many amazing sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. It would definitely encourage me to visit Istanbul.
