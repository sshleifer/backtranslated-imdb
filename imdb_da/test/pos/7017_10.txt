I think dirty dancing was a great movie, they were trying to make another Havana nights, which was good, but it was nothing like dirty dancing. I'd like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a mess. many times movies are made, so when they try to add on more, they start to change the people so the movies go down the hill. I would love to see dirty dancers have another to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick a Jennifer did so well together. This movie was made in 1997 its time to make another. But this time begins where it relaxes and holds the same people in it.
