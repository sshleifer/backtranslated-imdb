The Custer Legend, a la Warner Brothers Epic. There is no casting against type here, with the flamboyant Flynn as the flamboyant Custer in this howling tribute, not only to Custer, but to the men of 7. Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famous 'Boy General' from his turbulent days at West Point to his last game at Little Big Horn. Big freedoms are taken with facts here, and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to Redman's situation is as the story relates. But this one is done on such a large scale that the fighting scenes alone gave employment for every extra in Hollywood. Down beat ends and all this is fun!
