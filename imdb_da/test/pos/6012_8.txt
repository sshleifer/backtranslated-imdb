After setting up five seasons on the small screen from 1976-79, "George & Mildred" transferred to the big screen in the middle of 1980. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke maintaining their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was brought on board as an author. Unfortunately, this movie adaptation just didn't seem to hit the spot with the public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) is eager to find out if her outspoken husband 'George' (Brian Murphy) has remembered their wedding day. Of course he does not have, but to try to convince his wife otherwise he places a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arrival at the restaurant, they find that the place has changed hands. As you look through George's lies, Mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swimming hotel. On arrival at the hotel, George is confused with Crook 'Harry Pinto' (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless hitman who wants a rival extinct! <br /> <br /> Not an excellent comedy as such, but a good natural piece of fun all the same. Plans to revive the series after the film's show were unfortunately interrupted when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980, from alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> The quietest moment - George speaks to his favorite garden. His neighbor, Tristram creeps up behind him and says '' I think the time we had a chat ''. George, think it has developed power of speech, drops gnome in shock! Merry Christmas for colleagues IMDb users, especially 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril Blake' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Have a good one!
