I've always loved this movie. The music, the story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the movie. The music remained with me over the years. The WWI airplanes were great and the comedy is typically Blake Edwards. Slaptick is after all his forte 'after all. Julie's song is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie singing to them. I wish she was singing to me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars from the period and WWI music.I was happy when the DVD arrived. Now I can flute in the dark and see it again and again.
