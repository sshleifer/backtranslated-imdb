This movie had me spellbound tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics to show it continuously. John Voight, this caste of little-known black actresses and most of all, the kids, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday night. How wonderful to see the early work of this experienced actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is in the role of superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is legitimate, an actor like Lane would have the ticket. Cronyn was an excellent choice for that matter. I want to count this movie as a true treasure to keep in memory.
