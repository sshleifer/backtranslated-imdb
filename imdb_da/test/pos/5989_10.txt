I love foreign movies and this is among the best. I tend not to see this as a comedy as it is listed and comment on how we see others around us. The firm's lead in the movie is not considered to be when she is at home with a large company, and people say and do things around her all the time they wouldn't say in front of others. <br /> <br /> This leaves her with a wealth of information that can make or destroy the only mortal. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is an exciting story. There is an underlying story and almost many stories in the story of this movie. I just hope that if anyone decides to make an American / English version of this movie, it is not the friend of Three Men and a Baby who would definitely do a bad service for this movie, one should see ... ..
