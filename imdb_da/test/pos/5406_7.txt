Another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of the American suburbs, Imaginary Heroes tells the life of the Travis family, who are all recovering from their eldest son's suicide. <br /> <br /> The couple in the middle of the film is mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both acting in different ways due to death. While Tim is experimenting with prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy goes back to his former self, smoking marijuana and expressing an old act of adultery. The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when referring to the fact that both are sold out of their own family: Sandy because of her affair and Tim, initially because of always being in the shadow of his more successful elder brother . Worried less time is allowed for Sandy's husband Ben (Jeff Daniels), who in a devastating denial of denial orders Sandy to make an extra plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old dinner table. Michelle Williams' older sister Penny is underwritten and can easily be taken out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its long runtime, Imaginary Heroes does not explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy does not translate as well as author / instructor that Dan Harris may have wished. And the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic is not depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. But despite some problems, the key ideas of Weaver and Hirsch are amazing, and they can easily carry the film to its successful subdued conclusion. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
