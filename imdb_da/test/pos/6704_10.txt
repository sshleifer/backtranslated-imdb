Lifeforce (1985) was a cannon funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. It is a very interesting movie dealing with a couple of space vampires who accidentally return to earth during the mission of the latest space mission. Steve Railsback stars as the only survivor of the tragedy. But really the people's movie is just a showcase for Mathilda May's natural beauty. She is a smoking hot number. The director was a big fan of Female Vampire (a.c. erotic). Miss May recreates Lina Romay's title role The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There are lots of good effects to keep the genres fans happy. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this period (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper movie or Mathilda May, this movie is right at your alley. <br /> <br /> Highest Recommendation! <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned Mathilda May, is smoking hot?
