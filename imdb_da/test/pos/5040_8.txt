Possibly the best John Travolta role ever. Saturday Night Fever was a fantastic movie and role, but a long time ago. I can't think of many of his films or roles that I have wanted myself, and it's easy to think of rotten. He can do meanies as in Pulp Fiction, but he makes the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better (just as worn) job with it. Plot views are available everywhere, but the plot is not intended. Just go on the trip and enjoy the wisdom of the little funnies along the way. There is nothing that does not like this movie unless you are looking for something deep. I wish there were more movies like this one. We need a break from deep or fantastic or pig or complex or hysterical.
