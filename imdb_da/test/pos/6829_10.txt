The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you just what its fans lacked - quite a few key actions. From the very first scene you still see new features that you didn't expect to encounter. It is the best evidence that the series, which enters its 4th season, still lives and kicks hard. Although manufacturers do not surprise us with some more flash-forward this time, returning to flashbacks is more than satisfactory as it brings some shocking facts. Flashbacks introduce a couple of fresh characters, and the known ones are connected in a surprising way. The fresh figures dominate the entire episode, and I can't say it does any harm. Their scenarios and their actors both do extremely well, giving us a bracing feel - right after the episode, you will realize that the show really needed people just like that. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Dead" is full of poignant actions and highly written dialogues. I am sure I will quote the best scenes of the episodes for a long time - they are just so good that they remain in the minds of spectators. The section is entertaining, smart and perky. You like "Lost", you have to see it. My voice is ten.
