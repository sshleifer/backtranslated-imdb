After a long period in the West End, this charming film Margaret Rutherford, as Headmistress 'Miss Whitchurch', republishes in this financially successful 1950's adjustment. The exterior scenes were filmed on site at a public girl's school near Liss in Hampshire. Within 12 weeks, both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell were in a nearby hotel and would often visit the school in the evening where they would happily enjoy the company of the true schoolgirls. Although the movie's script contains only two original lines from the original game, the leaders and supporting actors are in good shape and you can only feel sympathetic to their problems, especially in the final stages.
