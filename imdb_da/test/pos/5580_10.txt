This is perhaps the TV series with the greatest potential in any series around. The production values ​​are in a separate class. The signs are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at best. Some of the foreigners are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humor that makes it impossible. I hope this series will continue for many years and will have many spin-offs. Science Fiction has had its bad press, some are justified, but this is really a flagship science fiction series, and I thank Henson for that. Top marks.
