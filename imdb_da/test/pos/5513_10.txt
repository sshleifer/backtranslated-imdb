Honestly, this is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. I was fascinated by the story, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole trip. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The setup has already been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an online predator that creates meetings with teens, abducts them, and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and he is one of the scariest psychopaths ever created; Perhaps the most scary because he is so human and you get meaning (especially if you are in the body's modification at all) that there really are people like this in the world. <br /> <br /> But the biggest reason I liked movies and the reason why it's so terrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the start of the film, the roles are clear; the victims are innocent, the policeman is the good guy and howdy is pure evil. In the other action, however, things have changed a little. You want Howdy to be wicked, but it turns out that he's really just a victim of circumstances and maybe it's good and bad isn't obvious. It's scary to find yourself jubilant for the "bad" guy. <br /> <br /> A few people have mentioned that Strangeland should have been broken into two separate films. To be sure, there are certainly two separate "actions", but this movie works so well because the two actions are back to back. The first act is the typical psychotriller, but the other act is the most disturbing because of the viewers' reaction to the situation. I don't think it would have worked the same way if the other act was extended and transformed into a successor. As a big horror movie fan, I highly recommend this movie. It's the first horror movie EVER to give me nightmares.
