Someone says that this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are fun; The first time I saw this series, I was in the video store, people around me started laughing, no matter age or gender. A teacher said that to guarantee a person's attention in a book, the beginning should be entertaining and the end should not be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first few minutes in the series, the boy is hit by a car, during the last few moments in the series sees the same car .. Episodes had a touching and fun ending, especially last. I'm not sorry to buy these series.
