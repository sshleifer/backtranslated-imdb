Before Barton skips my remarks, let us all just remember that opinions are like asses, we all have them ..... I loved Sigourney Weaver & Jeff Daniels, I loved the dialogue and thought the play was sublime. Downplayed just perfect and discreet. Unlike some others, I didn't find this @ everything predictable. <br /> <br /> I found Sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially her scene confronted with the mob in the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found it comfortable and didn't expect to recommend this to anyone and everyone. That's why there are different varieties of ice cream, something to please everyone ...
