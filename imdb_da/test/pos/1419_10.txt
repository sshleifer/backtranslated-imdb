Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time", this amazing film by Eroll Morris documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. He has contributed more to science, despite his debilitating illness, ALS, than a knowledgeable scientist could only dream of. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to tell about Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student who was recognizable bright. He made his way through college and university where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions in his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris discusses how radiant Stephen's mind evolved from childhood to the present, at one point the mother tells how she - when she was pregnant - prophetically bought an astronomical atlas to read while in hospital. Hawking himself tells the timeline of his discoveries while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues who have been fortunate to be friends with the magnificent man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was first fascinated by the discovery that the universe grew similar to how a star would expand. We also know that the stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes". If this is the case, will the universe not start contracting itself, turning itself until we reach the great crisis? as Hawking puts it. And when the universe begins to fall, time will not "reverse"? When I asked this question, I began to believe that death may not be the end, perhaps one day time will go backwards, and our death will be our rebirth and our birth our death. The universe is a great cycle like everything else in life. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe reuses itself. This is quite logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions considering it. That's why I love this movie and why isay it's a must see !!! An 11 out of 10 ... Morris never ceases toamaze!
