This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I have ever played. The reason is a little choppy, but the game never fails to send you lots of chills and excitement. Many people pay tribute to the game when they found out that there are no cheat codes for it, and there are very few health pots and ammunition. But actually, after you've gone through the game once, you're more familiar with monsters and different spaces so you can easily get the second time. The puzzle games are big, not too hard, not too light. There are tons of different monsters so you'll never be bored. And there are plenty of play areas. You really want to be in a good Stephen King novel while playing. It's lovely and scary. Choose this game up cheap and have fun.
