'Bluff' has been showing for a few months in cinemas in Bogota, and today I finally ended up seeing it. I didn't really know what to expect but was very happily surprised. It is a crime comedy of the same ilk as Snatch, etc., and it manages to balance balance elements of excitement with comedy. The film's style has been established early with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator sitting directly to the camera - odd first time, but subsequently fit naturally. <br /> <br /> With my less than perfect Spanish, I still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow, and lots of comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend laughed a lot at the various depictions of people from different regions and community classes who passed me a little, but for example, a well-depicted depiction of a pompous idiot in power position is fun in every language. br /> <br /> I think it's on the film's credit that it has something of a global flavor: I wasn't often reminded that this was Colombia, which I looked at. Nevertheless, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos live like some of the characters in this movie, and it is not a misrepresentation of Bogota or Colombia's society in any way, only a * selective * depiction - as some movies are likely to portray a 'real' situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it comes to your country, definitely go ahead and check it out: it's a very slim and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humor. And all in a tightly packed 90 minutes.
