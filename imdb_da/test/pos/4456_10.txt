If you are one of those people who think Lucio Fulci is about gore, gut and zombies, you should also see this (and "The Psychic" too). Although the movie contains some rather brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing topic, it's not the most important thing here. This is a truly impressive story and character-driven murder mystery that may be the director's masterpiece. Here he shows that he is a true craftsman who creates a memorable, disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with frightening Catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. It also has a great cast, including beautiful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (from Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Still, it is Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also stared at Fulci's bizarre "Lizard in a woman's skin"), who steals the scene in the role of Majara, giving an excellent performance by a woman who is crazy about her superstitions and her The evil murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the film is Sergio D'Ofizi's filmography, which along with the melancholic Morricone-esquire score by Riz Ortolani helps bring the "secluded Italian village with a dark secret" attitude to life. I have to admit that the dummy head hitting the rocks has pulled me off, but it is still a certain Italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought-provoking genius. 10/10 for me. If you liked this, I recommend seeing Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" as they are a bit similar and they are both undervalued gems.
