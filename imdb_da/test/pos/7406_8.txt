This movie was my first acquaintance with Chris Cooper's talents. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. I knew when I saw the movie that several good things should come from this gifted actor. He plays a Union Captain who, together with a couple of hired men, is foraging in Eastern Kentucky. They are in the yard by a "Sesech" woman whose husband has chosen to go to Confederacy. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Eastern Kentucky, and its severely divided feelings during the war, is so very precise. If you are looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and gut, it wouldn't be. If you are looking for a drama that explores people's psychology in war, in fact and philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalty affects the interaction between people in the border states during US civil war.
