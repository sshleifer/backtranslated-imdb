Witchery or Witchcraft as it is commonly known in Europe, creatures with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) wake up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) & Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston, renovating it and re-opening it. Together with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to control the amount of work to be done, they also meet with the property agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hiring a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there they enter the hotel and begin inspecting the property while they are back on the boat Sam is killed and the boat loosened to sail in the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin leslie (Leslie Cumming), who happens to examine a book that she writes about the cruel legends and superstitions around the infamous island and hotel. When the night draws on a violent storm outside, they isolate them from the mainland as a mysterious "lady of black" (Hildegard Knef) who quits when the old evil in the hotel seeks fresh victims of demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic rites ... The director of this American Italian co-produced movie is a little shrouded in mystery, as IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato did honor in both ways to be honest Despite the bad reputation, I found Witchery quite entertaining in such a bad-it's-good cheesy kind of way. The script credited to Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa on IMDb again is confusing as the actual credit on the movie itself is Daniel Davis, yet the one who wrote this thing did a decent job, so stop laughing. At heart, it is a haunted house scare but adds some gory deaths and a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives and did not come on my nerves as much as I thought they could, it is not plotted very well, it does not make sense and the dialogue is not exactly top disappointing stuff, but as a whole the Witchery entertained me for it is 95 odd minute duration plain and simple. It's pretty good paced, a little slow to come maybe, but there are lots of surreal, bizarre goings-on & cruel deaths to keep one amused. Part of Witchery, which destroys part of it's credibility, is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably quiet enough to swim in, Witchery's supposed 'twist' ending didn't really seem to me either & just check out the stupid look on Cumming's face on the last freezing plate. The hotel provides a good isolated location and adds a certain atmosphere to the film, which has the distinctive undeniable 'scare' feel throughout, cheap horror on it. Technical Witchery is not bad at all, it was obviously shot in place, so it looks good throughout and while it is not just as the highlight of film-making features, the overall production values ​​are slightly better than expected. The violence and gore are of typical Euro explicit, a woman has her lips sewn closed and hung inside the fireplace so she can't scream while the others light it, someone is crucified and then burned alive, impaled on swordfish & pop & a woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was shot in English, so there is no duplication in performance David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair in the same movie, what more can I say? Yes ladies Hasselhoff takes his shirt off & for the boys Cummings takes her off. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are a hoot to look at this thing, but the little child is very annoying and can not work at all. I'm sure most sane movie guests will disagree with my opinions, but I still know the fact that I liked it and would happily watch it again, Witchery is pretty good fun and definitely worth seeing if you are in "bad" movies or your horror fan in general.
