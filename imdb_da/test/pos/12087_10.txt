I can be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States, but this man does it for me. That mustache makes me shake up. I remember when I first watched a video of his. The girl he hit was amazing. The depth of his play when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures in our Mt. Rushmore. If I could ask him a question, would it be, "If you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?" Will Orhan make a reunion tour? Notice the great guys like Gordon Lightfoot, true music from the heart never fades away. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan For Life)
