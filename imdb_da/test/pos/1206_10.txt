I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I see it, the movie is as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960s elderly anti-war "hippies" living in New York City. This small group is done by a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who has been designed for the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to discourage him, Claude eventually reports on basic training in the army. Still worried about leaving them, the hippie group steals a car and travels across the United States to visit Claude "... for a couple of hours", with the words of George Berger (to a parliamentarian stationed at the entrance to the Claude Claude base. temporarily stationed in Nevada). The result is really touching, so I won't spoil it for those who haven't yet seen this amazing movie. The musical score is just as amazing! Don Dacus (from the rock group Chicago), who plays part of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key person, but the movie would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, an uptown girl who is conscious of the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A must see movie !!
