My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed enough. I would have loved to see more of everything: the ship's building, technique, training, first lift to orbit, preparation for departure, Venus Orbital Injection, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first leg, Venus to Earth, instead of zipping it as a n Â° 10 corporation bus. In fact, I would have seen a series on the scale of Earth Story made of this, with an entire hour dedicated to each planet and perhaps another to the loop around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and viewers' attention channels. <br /> <br /> Re science: Let's be just about the quick time delay: they initially mentioned that there was a delay in conversations, but they let it evaporate as they reached the outer planets. Some kind of conversation should be presented to the viewers and we must assume that the store was edited for taste; so no complaints there. But zero for noisy spaceships. The only movie where the spaceships don't noise was Kubrick's 2001, and even then, he raced out using the crew's crew in their helmets - which * was quite effective. I wish Space Odyssey's decision makers had understood how horrible the sight of large rocket engines could be in absolute silence, but Pegasus makes much of the same roar as any other cardboard spaceship in any other cardboard sci-fi movie. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. No complaints there, actually praise for bringing out radiation problems as well as they did. I just hope that having made this movie will not discourage the BBC from making a really detailed version, but it is assumed that it is not next week or next year either ...
