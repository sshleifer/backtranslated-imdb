This movie is amazing. It's fun, sexy, violent and sick, but it all coincides for a brilliant troma rendition of Romeo and Juliet. If you don't mind being exaggerated a little (ok much, but it's fun widespread), watch this movie. It is worth it! There is not a level that it does not deliver. I've seen it three times now and it's still great. I recommend it. Go! Get it!
