Inside, I am Dancing (Rory O'Shea was here) is the story of two disabled young men, Rory O'Shea, who is almost immobilized and restricted to wheelchair and Michael Connelly, who is disturbed by MS and also limited to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Seen in Ireland, the film opens with Rory, who arrives at a home help. He eventually turns to Michael, but only after a few tense scenes, where Rory rebukes the staff and other patients on the usual "movie path" that plays high metal music through profanity and general discomfort. His budding friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael, or at least is willing to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, through a trial and a hustle, the couple is petitioning and granting, the right to live their own in specially adapted apartment. The apartment was paid by Michael's father, who had essentially left him to make his handicap. The two also employ an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them with their daily lives. This is essentially where the core of the film develops as both develop feelings for her. Michael is hit particularly hard Unfortunately, for both, but especially Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her leaving. As Michael temporarily regressed and wants to return to Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue living alone. The movie ends with a sad note that many viewers may have seen, but in the end we feel that Michael has really become independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed to him at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> You know, I can't say I've seen many "disabled movies" and I don't know if they could be considered a particular genre. But there is some sort of formula for them. A person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until a liberating force forces him / her to do so, and the Inside I'm Dancing is really different. What works, though, is probably more subtle about tops and valleys, the two men go through, so what to expect. There are no deliberate gratuitous moments and no "stand up and cheer" manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the fun parts are fun. Some viewers may recoil a little, that Rory is the nail-haired punk type with the nose in the nose as the overly perfect "rebellion clich√©", but actor James McAvoy does it somehow right. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it does not seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to gain the audience, but rather a young man who really has pain over untouched love. That kind of pain many can relate to regardless of their physical condition. Again, these are the kinds of things that make the movie work and make it victorious without being overbearing and comfortable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
