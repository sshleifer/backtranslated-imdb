I first saw this movie in a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple walked up to me and asked me if I needed help - I was still crying like a madman. The movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's over the top, it's gay - but it's amazing. I think every character is plausible. Everett's character is the means for a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws out his (terrible) friends, he has a mood, he can hurt a fly, "fly", who killed the love of his life, twice so. Bates is a miracle, she is perfect, like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she herself loves the gay lover of her idol is for me the essence of true love. I myself understand Max (the man), he is sad his life, he has a quality of life crisis. He moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realize a) he is the really boring part of the relationship and b) he loves his wife. I love the fact that she eventually comes back to him because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. For in the end he is her husband, and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is genuine, he is the man she loves in much down to earth. I've seen it about 50 times, and I love this movie, all about it unconditionally. BTW, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he's talking about as one of the best movies he has ever made. For me it is the best movie he has ever made.
