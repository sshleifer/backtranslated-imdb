STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation movie. Certainly, nudity and sexual openness are there, but it's not too laughing. Stephanie Rothman wrote a socially convincing, well-written breast and ass movie that confronts the issues of racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam war, free love, LSD and drug experimentation. Four-sex college roommates take their nursing internships at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal service Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to the public health administration Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) for gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) for psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunity to pamper and fornicate as they exploit much to the benefit of male viewers. These are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. Visceral yet low budget action sequences spread everywhere. There is a very bloody shot at the Resistance headquarters where two police officers are shot and killed along with several members of the group. An anti-(Vietnam) war protest consisting of spookily-clad young people of all races painted as skeletons becomes violent, with cops beating protesters. The effective travel sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, strange and confusing sensory and memory configurations with hypersensitive overtones. In short, STUDENT NURSES is a thought-provoking and convincing reflection of the times, expressed through the perspective of real women (since it was written and directed by a woman). But it is still fun and titillating, despite its neat treatment of the subject.
