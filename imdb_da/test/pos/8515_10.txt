Background information - Film Octopussy & Never Say Never Again were made the same in 1983, and of course people compare them. Moore vs Connery. Bond vs Bond. <br /> <br /> I've heard many people claim that the "official movie" Octopussy is far better. Well, I just looked at Octopussy. Bond runs an airplane of 100 miles per hour (impossible --- the wind will blow him off) by using his feet to force the plane to the ground and then jump out at about 60 miles per hour (again impossible --- try jumping out of your car --- you would end up with a broken body). How would the octopussy scene be "good" in any kind of word? Suddenly, Bond has super-human strength and a titanium body. And he does all those stunts in the ancient age of 56 ??? Complete crap. Incredible. Farse. <br /> <br /> --- Now let's contrast the above scene with Connery's "unofficial" Never Say Never Again: It doesn't have the same polish because of its independent movie status (less money), but at least you can Believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. The movie starts with Bond, showing his age (he is 50 after all) and is sent for recreation. Absolutely trustworthy. But of course there is nothing like a "day off" for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds a goal, even within the hospital. From that point on, the story jumps into another adventure, where Bond tries to locate his probes and eventually tries to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a brilliant job and avoided over-the top / incredible stunts. This film feels like a natural sequel to Connery's last film, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever ... the old style of Bond ... before the franchise became stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
