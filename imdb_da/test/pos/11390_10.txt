A small city child working in a big city becomes a big star and then spirals out of control. It shows you the rise to fame and then falls from fame and back to a small rise. Great cast of actors and a great instructor = a great, great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An amazing instructor who made Boogie Nights amazing. From the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A great story, a great movie. Mark Whalberg was amazing, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful as he is in total. Thomas Jane was also magnificent, and although he only had a small part, he played it to perfection. There is a scene in this movie, I can't get over, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene", it was great, musical and cinematic combined to make it amazing. I hadn't seen Boogie Nights and thank goodness I did, it was so well rounded and I'm now a big fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do what you need to do and watch this movie.
