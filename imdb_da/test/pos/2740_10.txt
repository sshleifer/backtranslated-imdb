My father had this movie as an 8mm coil. I loved it when he wanted to pull the projector, tape a sheet to the wall and play Gerald McBoing Boing. The idea of ​​a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors would ask me questions about my son like "How does he communicate with you?" I would answer, "Have you ever seen the comic, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would like a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators. This is how my son looks, he's the world. Recently, I spoke with a digital transfer specialist who stated most personal 8mm movies did not contain audio until the mid-1970s. I think I was quite fortunate to have seen the sights and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
