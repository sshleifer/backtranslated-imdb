I think it's incredibly difficult to write any full-scale Giorgino survey just because it is one of the viewer-related, complex, poetic and philosophical films that are hard-wearing if you look at them while watching them shell And come to their core at the same time, but there are several things that are safe and undoubtedly for any artist (which I hope I am). The first thing: It is a particular masterpiece, although the kind of art that remains for a long time; Second: It is one of the rare "dark" films where darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. As for the core of the film, someone called it Kafkian, although I disagree with it, for it is indeed far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like the parables of Edgar Poe: dark and scary, but through the touching the most gentle strings of our souls. In fact, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), Giorgino is a tale of eternal peace and love that can only be achieved through the eternal soul of the soul. Those who have such souls are usually labeled as insane by our society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue, all the others lost when "grown": the virtue of God's love. In fact, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be like children" (Matt. 18: 3), it is a true hidden line, although the film never deals with any kind of morality and concentrates only on the Christian philosophy of daring Suppose, true God is beyond any human morality. But I think Boutonnat is too harsh to portray "adult" people as a kind of demons trying to steal childhood from rare surviving souls, but that is his point of view, and he has the right to think it. While you see Giorgino not trying to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), look better for thoughts expressed through signs and their behavior, and learn from them. Also, I cannot mention that the film looks amazing through excellent photography, especially through the rational use of color filters, incredibly appropriate editing, wonderful plays of all cast and of course because of the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains reminding me of Brueghels "Hunters in the snow". Also interestingly, the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with sunken black ringed eyes running on a wagon immediately reminded me of Pesta (Plage) from the drawing of the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, who shows how a black plague sweeps the population into a small town in the mountain valley. Is it a coincidence?
