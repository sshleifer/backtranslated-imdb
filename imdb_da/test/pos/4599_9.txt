Shame on Fox to dump this movie. It was a total uprising and I only hope it will find another life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious satire. It takes "what if" the situation to extreme and it does not draw any blows (or kicks to the groin). It makes you think ... what will happen to this empire when we have become quite lazy and stupid? Everyone gets hit in this one esp. a number of big companies and even Fox News take a beating (which is probably why the film has never had a proper release - other than the marketing department thinking about the campaign and not knowing how to market it) so we just want to give up! "Some may find the movie sophomoric, because of the groin kicking and farting, but the movie is much more than that. You also don't get what Mike Dommer says, or you don't. Most of the negative reviews I've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> It will probably play for a week in the selected markets, so if you miss it keep an eye on the DVD, it will be worth the rent and I will eventually get it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good Job Mike Judge, it's a shame that you were screwed, but you made me laugh aloud and I'm looking forward to the next movie you're making.
