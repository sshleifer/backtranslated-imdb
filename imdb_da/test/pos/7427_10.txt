This movie is a hidden gem. I can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time. Errol and Eleanor Parker make for a really attractive and dashing couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really liked touching his daughters who referred to him as being her Robin Hood. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Errol Flynn. It's great to see that Errol also plays a father. Of all the accounts of his own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. Also supported cast is also wonderful. You can't go wrong with supporting players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a movie that is much better from get-go. This movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home. Enjoy!!!
