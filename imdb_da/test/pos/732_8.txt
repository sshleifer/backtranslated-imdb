The sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming pastor with astonishing red-haired knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work on a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the obnoxious assortment of colorless crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the sweet Betty Chandler), loopy judge Oliver W. Cameron (a delightful hammy Gene Ross), the paranoid Vietnam veterans Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the gracious William Bill McGhee) and nutty old hag Mrs Callingham (the extremely annoying Rhea MacAdams). The mentioned patients are urged to exercise their fantasies by Dr. Masters, of course, result in a rash of brutal killing. Director S.F. Brownrigg, working from a wise and appropriately overwhelmed script by Tim Pope, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a stifling thank-you and sense of insane and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's spooky score, the ugly set of designs, a couple of wild grisly murders, Bruce B. Alcot's grungy no-frills cinematography, lots of gorgeous robust scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game without a name (Ross is especially a total eye-rolling hoot) And the truly shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further adds to the overall infectious seedy fun of this choice trashy piece of 70's low-budget regional horror exploitation movie theater.
