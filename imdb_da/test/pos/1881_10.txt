Normally I don't go online, but it's Saturday, and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do, but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer Mighty' singing out of my head, it has been there for the last ten years or so, just popping up randomly when someone (me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie and actually send them on the internet, do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than he expresses (in the most literal sense) than why in the sacred name of G-d you see his movie? No one sees a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and understandable we see them, so we feel better about ourselves (like the people who see Jerry jumping and eating Chunky Monkey), and being easily entertained of thoughtless psycho-babble. I personally love Bruce Campbell movies. I'm not a complete idiot, actually I see myself as an intellectual and a teacher (haha, shut up, Ally). His film reflects insane, random, quirky, ridiculous ideals that anyone with a brain, screaming or no can enjoy. That, and he was kindly sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with facial hair. I rate this movie an excellent 10, just because I can. If you can't take simplified plot arrangements (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor (leather, spandex) and familiar, if not exhausted views of insanity, then you go cryin 'high, don't watch the movie (or anything that as much as the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was amazing in this movie! Way to go Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
