first real movie this year. fantastic long shots, sometimes with fix camera, so specific to Nordic cinema (accompanied dogma). A real auteur movie I find it. Athmospherique :-) It simply pleased all my senses and remember how the picture becomes violent and painful during the scenes when he tries to kill himself. That is the point I do not think it stands up in the whole plot. Why, if this was an ideal world, could you not die, but still you held your conscience? Either the real world was with "tailor-made" rules or was a "fantastic" world, but in this case, no accidents like people who remember how it was before could happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and perhaps more of Huxley's Brave New World, especially in the part where sex was actually accessible to everyone, as it was considered a right to joy. It lacked a plot, but I think it was better than this since you realized and felt all our strange behavior, absurdity, and the lack of true sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think the ending was brilliant. The true world is actually a homo homini lupus you eat if you are not strong enough.
