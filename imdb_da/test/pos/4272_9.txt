Fantastic show! About time comes a reality TV show that closes generation gaps. Participants range in age, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others looked so young that maybe parents or teachers handed in the film and hoped it would touch their lives as they once touched them. Fat has really become an American icon. Fat is a fun and entertaining movie where the young and the old can relate to. "You're the one we want," is sure to get even more fat holders. The only thing I wanted there was more of a character history, so again it is nice to leave some of it for the nostalgic fantasy of the 50s. Can't wait to see the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
