WOW !! Talk about a movie that shares the audience! This is a true love for it, or it is a bit of a movie. Personally, I really enjoyed it. I have noticed that other reviews compare it to Pitch Black - it's a bit stupid as the only thing they have in common is TRUE! People can be really stupid. No, this movie is much more in common with The Thing (how people fail to notice it's great - they even have the same basic music) Lots of Carpenter touch is there, blue collar hero, crisp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood. Perhaps what stops this movie as a true classic, it is the expression of other Carpenter works. Not least the Dark Star, with which it has something in common. I would be interested to know how much it really costs? $ 8,000? Is it even possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8,000? But I found myself strangely moved when the various space creatures died. They are so underplayed that it is like seeing a documentary at times. That said, the script is a bit clunky and only about half of them can act, and I'm not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them. But his gun is AWESOME !! Give it a try if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it, just don't expect 2001.
