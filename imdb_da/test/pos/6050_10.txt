Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later I came to the Corps. <br /> <br /> The web and company got it as good as possible in '57. Boot, in '59, was more like actually, like the Boot Camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black recruitment, in my training pony, was called "Snowball." I was called "Stick" because I was skinny as a shine. Each recruiter had a nickname, some rather in vain, stuck with him through his service in the corps. Come tasting or knocking on your ass when you turned up the SOP. "Drop, and give me fifty," must be hoom. Then it turned into "Drop and give me two hundred!" The DIs were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism and with the primary purpose of keeping us stupid MoFos alive when we hit battle. 200 years of experience were involved in the "sadism" and all that D.I. did or said had a purpose aimed at his mission. <br /> <br /> A Bad D.I. gets grunts killed. A good D.I., but apparently the world's largest asshole, keeps them alive. You can't kill the enemy if you're dead. <br /> <br /> If you didn't know, Marine Corps has a primary mission: Kill the enemy. PFD. Everything else is pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC
