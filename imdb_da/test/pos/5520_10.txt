See, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems that go with low budget movies. But you have to see this just to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She's SMOKIN's hot and a great little actress to start! These types of scary movies are often a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree .. Lisa is not just brilliant, she's a hottie. The movie itself often goes together, and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, it really starts to jump. The others are obviously not in their league. This is not the exorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a funny little movie with a hot little actress, this is where to see!
