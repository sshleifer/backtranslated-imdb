Thoughtful, humiliating depiction of the human tragedy of war. A small but altruistic view of a family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This movie diminishes the "glamor of war" Many of today's films show war as an opportunity to highlight "hero's" and other glamorous traits of war, but very small attempts to show the real war of power actually taking on a community. This movie tries this through a tale of a person's memory of those days. This film is said to be a loose translation of an actual event, since in reality this film is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "actual events" during the civil war. I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
