Seen in Venice mainly at Lido, Visconti is "Death of Venice" a triumph of filmmaking that combines the expertise of Dirk Bogardes characterization and expert photography of the resort in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a movie to cherish. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music, often heard in the movie, increases the drama. The mood it creates is not always good. But what more would you expect with such a title? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the movie. Rather sparse indeed. It is primarily background sound and talk and laughter among hotel guests. The exciting part is to interpret the gaze between Gustav von Aschenbach, a composer of some fame and a slim teenage youth, Tadzio, who from time to time sees each other on the table in the hotel dining room, on the beach and in odd unexpected places around Venice. They seem to recognize each other's presence in the beginning with a little more than the proposal for a smile, but later with a strong and nineteen and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Every viewer wants his own interpretation. The composer has lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of longing for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction to this fragile young man with his dazed something girlish staring? Could he discover a new inspiration for an yet unwritten musical masterpiece? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this film captures the true spirit of 19th century Venice. The ladies are elegant, sun loungers on the sand, the kids slip into their bathing suits, glow of sunsets and a general satisfaction with the world. While some may think that the pace is rather slow at times, the film has a generally gentle quality, but with a simmering indecision between two oppressed people. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.
