I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job of writing, managing and co-starring in this movie. David Duchovny is just plain clean. and Minnie Driver is as sweet as ever. combine all the talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi you have an Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, rent the dvd, watch it once and put instructors on ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!
