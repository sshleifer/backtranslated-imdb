Having just borrowed the One DVD collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, I expected to get through the first few episodes and return it. I just found myself shouting on the screen to finish the first season on a rocker - just a week later, and I've seen the whole season. Where I found time for this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing. It does not take itself too seriously, it has sympathetic characters that are well-acted and the special effects (ignoring the odd sticky doll here and there) are "special" enough to give it the polished feeling. At first, I didn't understand that it was most recorded here, and it seemed weird to hear so many Aussie accents on a Sci-Fi show - it was most enjoyable for the protagonist (John) to land back in Sydney midway through the first season. <br /> <br /> I think this shows greatest strength is the vision that creators exhibitors of course had. They have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explained past actions, and they continue to smash John's conversations with slang in a fun and undisturbed manner. In addition to seeing the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I see a little plot-rip-off - so it has managed to maintain an originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest of it is just as good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other Sci-Fi I've had in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and I am now very annoyed that they canceled it before the 5th. I hope they revive this show - with the same actors in either a movie or another series. It would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished when I imagine that with a show so much thought to put into it, to make it jaw without adequate warning, I'll let myself be robbed. . <br /> <br /> Gotta go now ... heading back to my brother's place to snaffle the 2nd season. <br /> <br />
