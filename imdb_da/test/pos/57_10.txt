I gave this movie my rare 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it and realized it wouldn't be a movie with a strong plot line, I nearly knocked it off. I'm very glad I didn't. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie, a true story that is primarily about the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inner and outgoing) Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in Lackawanna. <br /> <br /> Very interesting not only its strong characterizations of the nanny and the people who lived in her guest house, but also it gives us a look at what life and society were like African Americans in the 1950s, before integration and the good and bad aspects of segregation and how it eventually hit and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast, there is some fine song and dance from the era.
