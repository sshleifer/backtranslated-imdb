This movie has to be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with both bizarre and ugly films about four different stories from four different places in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the wrong wooden figure of an old finance minister is definitely the best of the four odd stories of love or career. I would love to see all four as a movie on their own, they can be so much more extended. <br /> <br /> The unique break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the series (if they make one) or the extended DVD. Apparently they had cut a lot to fit it in for just 3.5 hours.
