This sitcom was a big crowd puller in the years 1984-1985. It was time people could see deserted streets in most of the crowded Indian cities when there were sitcoms on Indian TV screens. All this was the result of the establishment of television relay stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of the Indian television networking strategy adopted by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided pure entertainment as a vast majority of Indian television audiences watched their black and white television sets. One fun thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an original company dealing with Ayurvedic products. A few days ago, I saw some episodes of this series, but the general ridicule was missing. This continues to prove that it can be with the ever-changing time when the entertainment material loses its charm and holds onto people's minds.
