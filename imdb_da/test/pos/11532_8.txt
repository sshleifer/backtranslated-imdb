I've seen this movie three times and every time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her genuine and natural performance. Many of us, who were Phoebe's age at this point in time, history will understand how real it is. Life for most of us is neither gently glowing romantic nor hard cynical pessimism. It's a blurred balance, and this movie captures that balance. It is also well constructed with so many fine details in the composition. Like the movie or not, judging by the unusually high ratings coming from the demographics of women under the age of 18, we know that this film reveals some important truths about how young women see themselves in the world.
