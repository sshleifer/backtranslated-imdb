TUGH LUCK follows a homeless drift when he is rooted in the underground crime world of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named Ike (Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon Ike describes a strong desire that Archie murder his evil wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the carnival. Things will soon become complicated when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her about the scheme. They become involved in a very steaming affair that leaves little to the viewers' imagination, after which they soon make a plan. Together, they plan to murder Ike, but it's not quite as planned. <br /> <br /> I would lie if I said this movie didn't surprise me. I was personally blown away by how good this movie was. By renting it several years back, I expected another clich√© thriller with many of the typical elements and themes that appear in many films of that kind these days. Within minutes I was hooked and found myself totally involved in the world with this movie. It's the kind of movie, like BUFFALO '66, that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and feel of paranoia. It's a movie that really pulls it out in great fashion. One thing I particularly appreciated was how the film portrayed it is character. The film is not as light and clear as it can be seen in the plot collection. These are signs that you actually grow to worry about and are fascinated with, including the signs that should be the evil ones. In fact, there are no good guys or bad in this movie. All the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true to life. There aren't many movies that manage to accomplish this task as smoothly as this movie does, but it's certainly a movie style that I like, and I'd like to see more of movies today. There were quite a number of crime films that were back in the early 50s, but there has not been as gripping and unique as this ever since! <br /> <br /> In terms of errors, I usually have much less grip. The movie itself is not exactly original. However, I doubt that most people would expect it to be original. The movie's editing style can also be annoying to some people, as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky camera all the way through. While I was not bothered by it and actually felt it was added to the atmosphere, I am sure that most viewers will not be so excited about it and may find it generally off-putting. However, despite the minor flaws, this is one of the most underestimated films in the 2000s. It is so refreshing to have luck and see an unknown movie that turns out to be good. It seems that this movie was a direct-to-video release, though this movie is far better than that. Had it been set in theaters, it would not have won any awards or would it have been seen much, but it would have much more recognition than it has today. Recognition that this movie deserves. TUGH LUCK is an amazing, entertaining and twisted neo-noir thriller with a true sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough fabric to make the average film grille more than just satisfied.
