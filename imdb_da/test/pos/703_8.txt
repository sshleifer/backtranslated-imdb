Probably because this is Colombia's first movie in color, the colors look different especially in indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a little unrealistic, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, a crime that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who begins to fall to Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess who runs the salon. There is a funny character called Nitro who doesn't think twice before it blows it. I especially enjoyed two moments of the movie, one when there is a huge horsepower and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so I assume they must have collected all those horses, no easy task . Another moment is the final shootout, technically very good. There is also quite a fistfight. Seeing this Western made in 1943 with such big action scenes makes you a sad conclusion: They don't make them anymore. Would they be able to, if they wanted it? I have my doubts.
