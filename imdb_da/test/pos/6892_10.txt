I absolutely loved this series and was very sorry to see it go. Yes, it is Christian based, and traditionally too. It's about some tough issues that the other reviewer points out, but I think it depends on your view of these issues, and as a teenager grows up and now as a mother myself, I was so happy to see a TV series that was clean and good, frankly, wonderful! I, unlike the other reviewer, was heart to see how they dealt with the condom deal. Instead of hearing the typical desire for condoms, they showed that their son is actually throwing and applying it to his later relationships, which were clean and godly because of it, and much safer because of it (100%! ). <Having seen this whole series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (when they sit down more permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode are just invaluable. I found the Touched by an angel (made by the same manufacturer) to be cheesy here and there (although I generally liked it), but this series was in my opinion much better made and had better plays and was also more interesting. It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a big plus. The family was not outstanding, they had their own faults, but in the long run they did what was right and saw them grow and change and struggle like any real family does. It was my favorite show at that time and will always be close to the top of my list, I hope it comes out on DVD!
