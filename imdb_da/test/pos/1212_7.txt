WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid opening match. Koko was always quite popular with the fans, and at that time Martel was still being over as heel talent. Eventually, Martel can win the winner in a rather unforgettable battle. Match 2: The colossal connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this time, Andre's health was really horrible, so his performance was really nothing special. The audience is 100% pro demolition in this fight. In the end, Haku is stuck and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the match Andre puts out Haku and Heenan and turns face to face what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania. Match 3: Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short game. Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. REST IN PEACE. for both men in the fight. John Tenta (earthquake) did not go so long ago with Hercules. In the end, the earthquake must stick Hercules to victory. Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really good game of the night. REST IN PEACE. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really solid back and forth action from both these talented guys. In the end, Brutus will win thanks to much of his big fan support during the match. Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic, but a pretty decent fight for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black / half white in what is significantly a classic moment. In the end, both guys are fighting for a double count without clear wins. Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs. The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy win. Surprisingly, WWE used to have a team team division. Match 7: Barbarian vs. Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan is the "Heenan Family" fairs better in this battle as The Barbarian takes the victory against Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good to go back and see years later. Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Great Intermediate Tag Tag Fight. Dusty Rhodes wears the unpleasant polka dot outfit to the ring. Ultimately, Rhodes and Safir will win over "The Macho King" and the Sensational Queen Sherri. Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express - Surprisingly yet another team fight. Take wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty lose by counting in this match for Orient Express. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent response despite his US patriot gimmick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, comes to the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Although he has support, Duggan takes the victory. Match 11: "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) against Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major event of the night. Roberts was extremely over with the fans. Match was significantly good for what it was. DiBiase is able to retrieve a counter winner at Roberts. But Roberts ends up holding DiBiase's money and giving it away. Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs. Akeem (with Slick) - One Man Time is boring attempt to be an African dream called Akeem. A really short fight that needed a little more time to develop as a battle. Boss Man wins with a sludge. Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Sneak Against Rick Rude - Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this fight. Well, WrestleMania didn't really get well. He always seemed to be on the losing end. Match 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Double as "The Ultimate Challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men. earlier in the night. The fight was actually very good, as people tend to believe that Hogan cannot fight. A lot of closeness that really got the crowd and people looking at home in it. Eventually, Warrior wins the victory at Hogan and wins both titles. A stunned crowd looks like Hulk Hogan is suffering his first loss at WrestleMania.
