This is another movie where movies are the best thing to recommend. It would be great if the film was a journey, but as a dramatic exercise in film art, it is not good enough. The theme of respect and cooperation between species discovers timely into the forbidden world of love between species, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating lack of understanding of the behavioral motives of both species. As with many films, one always wonders what could be achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we'll never know.
