This is the second film around 1985, the other was 'The Wedding Singer'. While "Wedding Singer" depicted the pop side of the 80s, "Rock Star" is about metal. Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock acts of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays her boyfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his entire life changes in one day. The story doesn't get too dramatic, and it just scratches the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll! The music is amazing and the concerts are brilliantly controlled! The whole concert feeling is very well captured when they used the right audience (no cgi here). <br /> <br /> Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, acting as a true metal dude! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
