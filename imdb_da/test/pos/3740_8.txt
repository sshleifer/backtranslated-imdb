Discover something that the journey is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanized than when you finally reach the destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most lavish feelings in the world. You feel energetic, refreshed and alive. You will simply be around that person every second of the day, and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes awakened. Love, and all the physical and emotional side effects that come with it, are pure bliss. Wherever it goes from here there is some guess, but once you start your journey together, nothing can be compared to that. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally scarred between aged individuals. In this movie, they are about to begin the mysterious journey together, where love and the discovery of emotions along the way help save them. Lane has to deal with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, only because the woman he cheated on no longer wants him. As bad as she was to him, as much as she really didn't like him, there's a part of her thinking about taking him back. Why are you asking? Because in life and love, sometimes comfort replaces intelligence. Yes, this man cheated on her, but she has children with him, she has made a life with him, and there is clearly still a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays a newly divorced man and alien father. He also lost a patient when she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now sued by his family and he is ridden but hardened about the problem. That's what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer did not tell him, he felt compelled to visit the woman's man in Rodanthe. He stays at the Inn, which Adrienne takes care of. Soon they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they can also get a chance in life. <br /> <br /> It now sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and though it may be something I've seen or read about before, Gere and Lane simply own the movie. Diane Lane lights up the screen with her smile. Her eyes flash in the dark, and the life she brings to the character is worth seeing. Geres character is a little different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. He blames himself for his strained relationship with his son, and her secret accuses himself of the death of the patient. On the outside, he tells anyone who wants to hear that it is not his fault and that she was a 1 in 50,000 accidents. But deep down it eats away at him. They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen. Gere and Lane have been in movies together before, but it's the first time they play lovers. They were married in cheating, but here the lovers play to find each other when the people in their lives have left them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would love to see more movies with them. In fact, I'd love to see more movies with Diane Lane, but it's a story for another time. Nights in Rodanthe are a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. They both become better people, they become both stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. This is a film about redemption, absolution and second chance. <br /> <br /> It will also ask you to bring some hankies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
