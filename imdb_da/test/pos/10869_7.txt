I learned one thing: You should take this movie as a fun period comedy if you will not be disappointed. The movie is fun because it's a nice comedy. I think over-hype damaged it: the much-glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and is not as good as they would let you believe. She sounds unnatural, fake: The best actress in this movie is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor, according to me. Daniel Auteuil is similar to Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. So the most hyped performances were also the worst. Costumes and production design are okay. It is certain that American film films are more accurate about these things because they have bigger budgets, but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money. A good period comedy, in short, with a first-rate casting (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
