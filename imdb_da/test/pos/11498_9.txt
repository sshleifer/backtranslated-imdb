Joline (Heather Graham) describes after his husband Carl (Luke Wilson) who disappeared to clear his head about himself and their marriage. Joline, who is committed to their marriage, starts her journey to find Carl, but on the way she discovers a lot about herself. At her turn, she meets a wealth of interesting characters who unconsciously help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my view, this is a classic road movie moving at the right pace (some viewers may also find it slow). Throughout the film, it keeps its humorous note, while Joline responds to the world's wildness around her with a warm, familiar, sometimes boring smile. All actresses and actors provide wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9.10
