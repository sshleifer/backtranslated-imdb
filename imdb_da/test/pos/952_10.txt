Ghilli is the best movie by Vijay & one of the greatest hits in his career .... When I hadn't seen Telegu movies, I could enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape a local goon who will force her. Being a goon, no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay, who had come to play a Kabaddi match, sees it here and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how Vijay helps her and how the girl eventually escapes the goon's links and Goon's father's political cronies. The movie has much of the edge of seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged to the end. Vijay is, as usual, very good in the kabaddi player's role. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the pile of vijay friends has all done their job competent. A special mention should be made about the villain in the film Prakashraj. The villain is typically etched and prakashraj has described it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The dialogue "Hi Chellam" has really hit the masses. The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage everywhere. Harani must be credited with such a fine masala movie that will be enjoyed not only by die hard vijay fans, but also by the general Tamil movie audience worldwide.
