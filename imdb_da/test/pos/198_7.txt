The Russian actor TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me of the young Audrey Hepburn, and the camera in THE CRANES FLYING seems to love her just as much. She is the focal point of a bittersweet war novel based on World War II in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its beautiful B&W movie, which was the main reason for watching the movie in the first place when I had never heard of it and decided to try it when it was on TCM. <br /> <br /> It is a very moving love story of a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier in war-time Russia. She is unable to forget the memory of his romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably explains to someone who has forced herself into a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. Their marriage is disturbed because she can't get rid of her for a happier time with her soldier's cut. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he will never return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. There is a very exciting final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers greet their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the happy families. <br /> <br /> Stylish and striking camera work is what carries the movie as well as the honestly played story. <br /> <br /> Tastefully done, but perhaps the English subtitles did not tell the whole story because some of the plate elements seemed a little blurred to me as if they had been glossy over. <br /> <br /> Summary: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Reminded me of another great Russian movie, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
