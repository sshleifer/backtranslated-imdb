This is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book that I did not read. The young Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a narrow Lower East New York Apartment. He dreams of joining his anthropologist father who is studying a violent tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and coke. When he is caught scoring Coke for her, one of her clients (Liz is a legitimate masseur) a rich Mr Osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limo with her strapped out lying in the back seat with dress hitched up and panties showing. (This and a couple of little-cut dress scenes are the only use of Ms Lane. Some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry to do all the things in "Unfaithful" to make A-List. This lady has more talent in her little finger than Streep, Roberts and Sally Field do in their whole BODIES and the time she was given her because of.) When they arrive, find friends find friends with Osborn's grandson Bryce and have come to age with his new boyfriend, grandson Maya. Liz joins AA and dates an AA doctor. She miraculously cleans up immediately. Finn, however, does many drugs along with sex with his new friends. Bryce seems like a good guy, but becomes jealous when Osborne takes Finn on a hot air balloon instead of him, and it leads to tragedy. The genius of the story (and film) is that they cut off violent acts from the hard, dirty, rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors. It's a little unlikely, but when Liz finds out what is happening to her son, she only requires action from Osborne and doesn't even contact the authorities or settle the Thelma and Louise style. There are elements of a Gothic romance with a revelation of the village idiot. Also they do almost no reason or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Lane's Pearl Kantrowitz in "Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 6pm and felt trapped. This is in the book, but not the movie. Nevertheless, these are minor deficiencies. The movie will be in full release on 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date, and I just couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> There were lots of red carpet moments in the theater I watched movies with almost the entire cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Director Dunne said she was out of filming a movie. I know she didn't promise to be there, but I came out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her personally. The movie is a particular Best Picture contender, which to act ?? Sutherland was pretty good, and it was also the boy who played Finn. Lane was grand as always, but I only remember one or two emotional scenes when she catches Finn with drugs "Let's get together together mother and son" and with Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". She would go better with a supportive actress, but it doesn't usually work that way. unless they give it to her for a "workgroup".
