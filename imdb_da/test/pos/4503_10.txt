This is definitely one of our favorites from 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys coming from different worlds but being as close as brothers is nicely told. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, and Written - from childhood to adulthood it never falls. <br /> <br /> An excellent insight into a lost culture and a very good way of understanding Farsi cultures and traditions is also a unique story in itself. It is both compassionate and exciting, uplifting and filled with tremendous grief, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent cast performances and great technical skills behind the camera, this is real movie at best. <Br /> <br /> Highest recommendation: A real piece of life that informs and informs.
