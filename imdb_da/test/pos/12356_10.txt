Yes, I suppose this movie is a bit boring compared to some of Pam Grier's other movies. The reason is overly familiar, the dialogue is set, and some of the play is not too good. But it is worth looking at the long stretch near the end of the film, where we see Mrs. Grier in a sexy blue wet suit with a zipper half unpacked. Yes, it seems like a relentless point when discussing an actress of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also an extremely beautiful woman, and back in the day she had a body that would not stop. It's nice to see it being displayed in a tight wet water piece. Rent the DVD and tell me I'm wrong. Can't you, can you? That's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave a 10 just to weapon art scenes! ;-)
