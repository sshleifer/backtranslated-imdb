In Victorian times, a father is separated from his family when mistakenly accused of treason and sent to live in the country. The children adapt to their new situation, make friends and get help from a friendly old man who bends on the train to help reunite their family. Actors who are direct films are often not very good at it. However, Jeffries is the great veteran actor of dozens of British comedy classics, one of the few exceptions. His brilliant view (he also wrote the manuscript, from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a classic British children's story, is what raises this film to art. While history can be very idealized, it combines wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative Yorkshire Dales settings to make a truly memorable movie. The photography of Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good filmmaking - not a shot is wasted in telling the story, but at the same time combining the images to create a fabulous romantic atmosphere. Agutter is simply perfect as the friendly Bobbie (okay, I fell in love with her at an early age, but I defy anyone to disagree) and Cribbins, whose cartoon-like pedigree is on par with Jeffries, is unforgettable as Perks the humble-yet- proud railway gates. This is a movie out of time; romantic, charming, very comfortable and with a beautifully naive sense of kind hearted kindness to all.
