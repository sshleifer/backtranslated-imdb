This is another of my favorite Columbos. It sports a top-notch cast, including John Cassavetes, who was never more handy or sexy, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now there's something I've always thought of - had Gwenyth Paltrow been born when this episode was shot, or was Danner pregnant at that time? Thanks to IMDb I have my answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel old. <br /> <br /> Cassavete's plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently using his mother's social connections (Loy). He has a mistress on the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She's sick of being back street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo gets a couple of problems right away. One thing he notes: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career. Where's the man?" It's great to see Falk and his good friend Cassavetes together. There is a very funny episode at the vet with Columbo's Bassett. Everyone in the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series it became.
