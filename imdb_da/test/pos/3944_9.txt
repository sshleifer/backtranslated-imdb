STORY Chinese Tall Story tells the story of the fair monk Tripitaka, who, along with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy, make their journey west on a quest to restore old Sutras, finally reaching the last leg of their journey in Shache City But everyone is not as it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons. Monkey tries his best to fight them, but is overwhelmed, knowing that his master is in serious danger, using his faithful golden staff to put Tripitaka in safety. <br /> <br /> The monk ends up being knocked out when he lands and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard named Maiyan, who takes a shine to our youth after many verbal misunderstandings. Maiyan is convinced that Tripitaka loves her, so when the monk decides, he must save Monkey and the others she insists on accompanying him. So the mismatched couple begins their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW Okay, so it's another trip to the West movie, which is not a bad thing for me since I love the story and the characters associated with it, so I was a little excited to get my hands on the DVD. So I think I start my review with the story, which is everywhere, in the first place it was your standard fantasy movie, then it became a ridiculous comedy, then it suddenly became full blown sci-fi if director Jeff Lau experimented with mixing genres, so he did a beautiful scatological job with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story center different from the infamous Monkey King, especially taking a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then putting him into what is the core of a love story. So overall, I liked it. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly solid, with the leaders Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi putting some really good performances, though Ah Char spends most of his screen time behind some rather nasty makeup. The support molding is nicely composed, it contains all the usual EEG main blocks, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong make appearances, an actor I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays Monkey King, he did a good job with The Limited material he seemed to have given, he played a version of the Monkey King that was subdued yet arrogantly. I had the feeling that he would re-enter the Twins Effect II area, but fortunately this is not the case here. I hope he gets a follow-up on this with himself in the central role, as the film opens up for a successor. Okay, so let's get down to the steering, which again is a little everywhere, gives Lau too much time for Stephen Chow-esquire nonsense comedy, which includes a scene where Tripitaka to rave up, dress up as Spider-Man as I Assuming, many lead a head scratching moment when the film is meant to be put in ancient China. He creates some really cozy and tender moments between the two leaders and kills in sappy territory, but this reviewer enjoys some sap for occasional occasions, so it didn't bother me at least. <br /> <br /> Right, now on CGI, which is mostly quite bearable, there are many moments that probably belong to a PS2 as many other reviews have said, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene where Monkey is fighting with a flying minion. Many of the CG gigs come in the form of the golden staff who turn into a variety of things, ranging from a giant fly sweat to a mech dress right out of The Matrix Revolutions. So yes, it sounds crazy, but I think you have to see it to believe it. Right, so in the end A Chinese great story is not a movie without it being missing, but it stays together long enough to entertain and generally be an exceedingly enjoyable movie. If all of the above doesn't turn you around to see what, if I put it that way, it's much better than Twins Effect II.
