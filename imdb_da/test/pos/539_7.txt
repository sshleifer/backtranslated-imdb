It's a movie to watch on TV and only once. I think it's good, but it's a little too far and the plot is so well known, it's not very original, but it's not boring. the best thing in the movie is the performances, natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a good job. I give it a 7.
