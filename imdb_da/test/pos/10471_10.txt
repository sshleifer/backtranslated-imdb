The French baby boy is shown on the modest house by two Danish sisters who are wet, cold and alone. Flying Revolution in Paris she seeks refuge in an unclear religious community on the coast of Jutland. <br /> <br /> Unknown to those who so generously take her in, she's a good cook, an artist of food. Babette embarks on her adopted community through thrift, productivity, and common faith. She leaves only when she wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. She returns with an exotic load that is a single meal in memory of the sister's father, the founder of the birthday. <br /> <br /> This meal awakens darkness in the mind of the denial of pleasure, but its features have been translated by an aging military officer who, as a young man in Paris, learned to appreciate the sensational experience unfolding here. The meal is the climax of the film, a community of love in the transitory artwork of the food - unimaginably uplifting about art, love and the meaning of life.
