I have to say every time I watch this movie, I am deeply concerned not only by the most painful four-year-old Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug abuse. It is also true to become dependent on something such as Substances, alcohol or pornography can not only hurt you, but also harm your most important people in the world: your family. Since the family is the first priority in the Asian culture, it is difficult for the circle to gather and show one person how much the family loves him / her. This is actually the first Chinese movie I actually enjoy, not for fun it, but the elements that surround it (great plays, touching story, really real direction) make this movie worth seeing. What stands out is that Hongsheng and his family appear the story themselves, instead of having some B-movie actors trying to imitate the real person. It shows the authenticity of the film.
