I admit that I almost gave up watching TV shows. Why? Because most people are about doctors, forensics or a girl / boy who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat. But I have to say I was wrong when I saw the first episode of Oz, one of the most amazing shows on television until today. Oz is a maximally safe prison show and shows episodes in the life of every cellmate inside the prison and their frustrations. What I like about this show is that it is the courage to show real life in the prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even thought the characters in the show should not be heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their lives. Sure, their show is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and medicine, but it is the purpose of this show; to present how brutal and frustrating can be life in the prison ... hi, you can't show life in prison as a "clean environment" with "sympathetic characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors do an excellent job, and the whole hour of this show goes really fast. The only thing I did not like in this show was the last season of the show, I think it was too strange and brutal, and the final was not satisfactory. But overall, Oz is still my favorite show on TV so far, it surpasses Sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House crap with just one main title. Brilliant show that has the balls to show which other shows are away from us; realism.
