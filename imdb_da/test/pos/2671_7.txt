It is sometimes difficult to see such self-conscious "message films" from an earlier, seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that is drummed into us from an early age, and as we have grown, teachers and authority figures have been seeking less open-minded but equally effective means of getting the message across. 'The House In Live In' (1945) 'is about as insignificant as "message movies" come, and Frank Sinatra seems to treat his audience as a child ?? Perhaps it was the meaning, as the short was undoubtedly primarily intended to influence younger filmmakers. Still, I found myself curiously touched when Sinatra launched in the sincere patriotic talk of what it really means to be American? and I'm not even American! Published only two months after the end of 2. World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy met with courageous audiences with a message of tolerance, coherence and above all hope. The music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Freshly tuned Frank Sinatra ?? Already a star, but not yet the superstar, would he stay? opens the film in a recording studio and flourishes "If You Are But a Dream" with a full orchestral companion. When, between songs, Frank goes for a smoko, he observes a large group of children who bully a young Jewish boy, their toes solely by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly puts an end to this childish behavior, feeling the insane "Nazi werewolves" and sharpening their irrational prejudices. He betrays so seriously and naturally the group of the blur associated with racist and religious discrimination, and assures them that any American culture, whether distinct from ourselves, is still American? Unless of course you are one of the bloody "japs". There is a hint of hypocrisy in requesting race tolerance while presenting a nation as the collective enemy, although you could hardly blame Hollywood for being less than enthusiastic about the Japanese situation in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra runs his point home with a wonderful cordial performance of "The House In Live In", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the songwriter first heard the song on film, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely ruled out three of his verses, which he found crucial to the message. These omissions were probably due to time constraints, but Meeropol understandably understood them not too kindly and was supposed to be thrown out of the cinema. When it was first released, "The House In Live In" was considered such an important short film that it won a Golden Globe for "Best Film for Promoting International Good Will" and an honorary Oscar for everyone involved. In 2007, it was considered to be "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and added to the library's National Film Registry, which is how I came to hear about it. While its approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later, this movie remains quite visible thanks to a young fella named Frank Sinatra.
