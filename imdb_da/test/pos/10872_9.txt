Want to know why French and Italians love / hate each other? Would you like a glimpse of the story that drives our lifetime? Then look at Virzi's film (in the original language of course) and you can watch a wonderful Monica Bellucci, who finally speaks her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, right on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters spoke Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil certainly in his shoes with Napoleon. Very fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape, and a picture of the political reasons to kill or leave a tyrant alive (good for all times).
