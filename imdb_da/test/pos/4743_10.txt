Things that are just right now, "news" were taken as given in this shocking documentary. I fear that as the study continues, the producers of this movie will be justified in spades. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers show us Davidians, government agents, investigators, with all their faults and all of their humanity. Nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening to yourself. Evidence - Congress's testimony, 911 tapes, news recordings, expert commentaries, interviews, photos and home videos - are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
