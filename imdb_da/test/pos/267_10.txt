Having seen The Lost Child many times since its release in 1995 and after reading the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's excellent role in it), it hits me more than ever that there is no made some comments on the brilliant role playing Robert Glenister as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most credible ways to portray the violent personality of a child abuser who carries the weight of her own past. When you see the episode for the hour and a half, you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, where hatred rests because of the gravity of his actions. I've seen more brilliant roles from my favorite actor, but this one never fails to make the greatest impression possible for me. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Price for Robert Glenister!
