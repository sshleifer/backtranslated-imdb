This movie is about two horse dealers who agree to escort a small group of Mormons over the desert. Along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who threaten the peaceful people and endanger their pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford movie, which of course did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. In particular, this movie lacks the great name stars like John Wayne, but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take the central stage. Long-time Ford stock character actors Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond has been elevated to the forefront and perhaps the one who came as "the management" is probably Johnson - though the other two had almost as much screen time and focus. This is not a bad thing as the film worked fine without the big star - and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Now, it's not that I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. Especially what music goes, you will probably either love it or hate it. I found the sons of Pioneer music a bit schmaltzy at times. It evoked a good mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes. I think little would have worked much better. Plus, with their incessant song in the background, I expect Roy Rogers to jump out at any time. Another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple, and the end was basically a foregone conclusion. But I am happy to say that there is a 'dog', although this is rather formal and sentimental, the film still worked well. This was mainly due to John Ford's beautiful, as usual direction as well as Ben Johnson's outstanding performance. He could give an excellent anchor to the movie. Another plus for me is that I saw another movie about the Mormon migration in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG. While the BRIGHAM YOUNG was a little stupid and too saintly in its depictions, the Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people - with sensitive and personalities. Oh, and when you talk about BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was "going to" the Mormon theme movie girl at this time, as she was a great supportive character in both films. Considering she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG, and it was about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, it's a stunt! <br /> <br /> Also, if you want to see a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a small role playing the scary Indian dance next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire.
