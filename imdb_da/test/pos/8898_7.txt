I'm not pretending to be a big Asterix fan who only saw another movie adaptation and only reads two of the comics, but it was a great movie, the same. I only saw the English version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix in particular. The story itself was both interesting and really fun (especially the conflicting name changes - all Viking names end in "off", while all the Gaulic names obviously end in "ix") with a small romance thrown in the (I myself) enhanced story, even though it balanced the total production with unnecessary clichés. <br /> <br /> The reason is this - the Viking manager, Timanah, is sick and tired of going to raid towns and then finding them emptied. Then he consultes his "wise man", Cryptograph, whose entire repertoire is composed of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that "fear gives the villagers wings". Taking this literally, Timanah believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets off on an expedition to download "Champion of Fear", an expedition that of course leads him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The couple is currently very frustrated - Chief Vitalstatistix's swept, pacifist nephew, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man, and the boy does little to no progress. When Justforkix unknowingly admits to being "afraid of everything" in the presence of the brain-free viking Olaf, is believed to be "Champion of Fear" and is being kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to save Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great movie with few errors beyond the clichés and sometimes, faulty dialogs. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though it wasn't true for the comic.
