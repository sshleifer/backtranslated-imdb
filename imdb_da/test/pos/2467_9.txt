Not being a movie aficionado, I'm not familiar with the names of leading directors, screenwriters, producers, and the like, but I can tell an excellent movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> The authors of this fine movie may well be at the top of their fields, or maybe get there very soon. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It shows talent closer to the ingenuity of showing with such realism how a national tragedy like Vietnam has influenced everyday life for a typical average American family and makes us look closely why so many homeless Vietnam veterans. Without getting into gratuitous scenes of gore and bloodshed, it makes us understand why so many of you men had flashbacks of what they had been through. /> <br /> The dialogue is particularly poignant and gives us an idea of ​​what was happening in so many families after Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good movies like this, not just about Vietnam but also about other social issues.
