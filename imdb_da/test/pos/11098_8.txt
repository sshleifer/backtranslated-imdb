Falcon and Snowman are the true story of two college age-rich children from L.A. who are spying on the Soviet Union. One played by Penn is already a drug smuggler up to his eyes in trouble. The other one played by Hutton lands a position with an airline where his job is to provide a top-secret cable facility. There, he learns about some of the dirty tricks used by the CIA on foreigners that America does not like. Don't forget that the movie is set in the early 70's, where Vietnam and Watergate are. The appeal of what he has learned decides the Hutton character to betray his country and convince his friend to stay with him. None of them are long on brains, it is not long before they are heading over their heads without exits. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller and is rather slow paced. If this is not a problem for you then it is worth renting.
