I thought this movie was excellent, quirky and different from the usual round of the mill 'disengaged cop cop catching serial killer' movie. Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really don't think I've seen anything he has done where he hasn't acted brilliantly. The dialogue was fun, sometimes the mood easier, and the plot engaged. Thanks to other reviewers to show the link to Alice in Wonderland - I hadn't downloaded them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands (as I am) and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining movie for a couple of hours. It was a pity that it was not released on the cinemas to a wider audience.
