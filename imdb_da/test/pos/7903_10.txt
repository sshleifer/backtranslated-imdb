Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays the 15-year-old Vanaja who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she is to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the low-throw and poverty passengers. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie and expect the exhibition of a miserable girl crushed by society. It's not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed and it is never clear that she will not succeed, despite the odds. <br /> <br /> The play that Mr Domalpalli draws from his play by amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is unique in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an excellent job as Mrs Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classic dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja teaches South Indian classical dance that she did in real life. I couldn't tell how good Vanaja's dance was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spell binding. (Don't think Bollywood - it's classical dance, it's also very different from the ballet because the dancer lifts his heels off the floor of the ball. In Sound Indian Dance, the heel is the primary point of contact.) <Br /> <br /> This is a movies not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but it will be better on a theater screen because the dance will be shown to better advantage. But if DVD is your only option then watch it that way. Just be sure to see it.
