I finally joined a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and used New Yera's Eve to watch a fantastic drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a tasty Nandita Das) who married the Dhileepan in Sri Lanka's backwaters and then takes over a war their romance. Shyama is flying to India and is in a refugee camp when she gives birth to a child. Several years later, we see Amudha, a legend, beloved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the teacher, beloved, and scholar, both parents and colleagues, in a lot How to solve a problem like the Maria sequence. On her birthday, she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. This increases her safe love-filled world, and she keeps on keeping track of why her mother-in-law left her. Several attempts at truancy later take the adoptive parents to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn down by a violent civil war, and the trio are inevitably caught in the mess. But this also causes them to meet the new Shyama - one who is finally confronted with Amudha and asked why she gave up her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child seizing the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her maternal mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons driving the birth mother, Chennais normality and terror horrors ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and exciting moments in the film. The film has excellent performances from Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolutely amazing role as Amudha - the surrendered - performed by the children's artist P. S. Keerthana. This achievement won her a national prize. <br /> <br /> The camera is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am fascinated by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these issues is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was completely unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, but was well matched to how much he suited the little girl. His one liners were fun. The mother played by Simran was also quite multidimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter, but also concerned about her biological children. Shock, anxiety and obsession with the child Amudha was outstanding portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her broad accusing eyes made most of the speakers. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Mani consciously made them mysterious so as not to give us obvious ideas as to why they were as they were - agreeing to why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also prevented him from being judgmental - it was another conflict where he did not take any pages but only reported while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely laugh at the movies, but this one left me damp eye and little heart clip. This is a beautiful movie - a treasure and a goalkeeper if you can find a copy; bed borrow or steal one today and watch the movie!
