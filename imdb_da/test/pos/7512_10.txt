This is one of the greatest films ever made. Brilliant plays by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This film is both disturbing and extremely deep. Don't be fooled into thinking it's just a comedy. It is a brilliant satire about the medical profession. It's not a beautiful picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who are constantly making money outside the hospital. And yet you really think this is a hospital. Manufacturers were very cautious about including genuine medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really reveals how hard it is to run a hospital and how bad things were already in 1971. I loved this movie. P. S. - I noticed that the incompetent dealer surgeon played the head of the firm of LA Law. The young doctor played in Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since Becker and other shows.
