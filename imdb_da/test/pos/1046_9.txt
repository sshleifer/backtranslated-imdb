I discovered this movie by accident, and it was really a wonderful surprise. A Christmas classic, it is also one of the finest comedies from the 40s. The story is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) educates her by writing culinary columns to a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor into the Connecticut farm she writes about. The only problem is: She doesn't have a farm and she can't cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with his wonderful chef Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> There is a nice direction by Peter Godfrey and the throw is really amazing: Stanwyck has never been better than this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make fun and human supporters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well, but when the film continues, it really becomes a bore. You almost feel spoiled for Elisabeht Lane, that he ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven, both of whom would have been more suited to that. Anyway, this is a merry Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I advise it to anyone who likes to spend fun and sweet holidays ... in Connecticut.
