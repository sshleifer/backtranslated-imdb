I had heard of John Garfield, but I didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in reality too, so he knew his part. He was a refugee throughout the film. Someone else killed a man. His character was blamed. He is conscious of a family that has questions and is not quite sure what to do about him. All the possible less sudden consequences. My favorite was the scary swim scene in a water tower where the water was deep, and a Dead End Kid couldn't swim and neither of them could get out. John's sign saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them right to the very end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's possible love. She was trustworthy but not lovable in my opinion - the only weak link in the film.
