I remember seeing this series eagerly every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem with Michael Praed who left by creating another Robin, this time Earl of Huntingdon. I think there were legends of several Robins in the Middle Ages. Another thing I loved was that it was filled with young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men would have young people, since all people didn't live so long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent resembled Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it's a shame that they couldn't have at least made a one-time special to tie all the loose ends and give it a happier end.
