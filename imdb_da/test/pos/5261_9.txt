I'm a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon, my wife suggested that we go to The Women. After reading reviews I thought it could lead to an afternoon nap. Wrong - this movie kept my interest from start to finish. It was great to finally see Meg Ryan looking super again. Let's see it, Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age as Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, was exceptionally traded by young India. I could understand the dialogue, which is tough in many current movies because of quick speech. Cloris Leachman and the woman from Finland were great as housekeepers who are expanding their regular duties. NYC scenes were nice to watch. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual was great. So I gave this chick flick a 9. Guys- Go see this yourself just for the eye like Eva Mendes. It won't disappoint.
