The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service message when you see the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and of course victims. In this clever drama, there is education about pollution and surviving chaos, while the meantime looks at the way in which the crisis is controlled, the viewers ask for mistrust consultants and be afraid of the attackers. The film, which was originally sent to the BBC, has raised doubts about official preparation. Performances are correct, unobtrusive, but never amazing. The flick is just a beginning, a provocative start that leads to a greater discussion, but it will work in my opinion, give the right excitement and cause the audience to justify and ask themselves questions.
