I saw it when I was twelve. It was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was. I had read the mystery series of Happy Hollister's children, and they were about a family of child murder who always got their husband. But we were not able to solve the mystery with them. This movie showed me that a good mystery is what makes the viewer / reader finally say "OH !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
