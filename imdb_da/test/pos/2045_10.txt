I'm a Geena Davis fan for life because of this movie. I've always loved Samuel L Jackson. And the two do a good pair on the screen. This said I think 'TLKG' is the best action movie I have ever seen, forget about the twist endings that the audience is now going to expect, and that the filmmakers are now trying (mostly not) to incorporate in their movie. <br /> 10/10
