I watched this movie late at night on a free channel, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Being a horror movie fan, I often watch these kind of midnight movies during the school holidays. More often than not, the horror films during this time are usually large lamers. 'Campfire Tales' certainly doesn't fit into that category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of short stories based solely on well-known urban legends. They are pieced along with a setting involving teens who tell these stories about a bonfire. This campfire setting in itself has a mysterious plot. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, which is obviously used mainly to create the other ghost stories. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four if you count 'The hook at the start'), all of which are really scary and well-made. I especially enjoyed the third story ('The Locket'), which involves a guy whose motorcycle crashes in front of a mysterious household. This particular story works well in really freaking you out with sudden flashbacks of the house's history. In addition to this, the end of the story will shock you completely! The first story ('The Honeymoon') was also very creepy, although the second story ('People can lick') lacked anything. <br /> <br /> Being a horror movie veteran, I usually don't get flipped out. This movie certainly made it good! What I especially wish for this movie is that it is divided into three shorts. This means that the film will not go through an hour or so of character development and establishment before the real bloodshed begins. This makes 'Campfire Tales' perfect for overnight stays, parties etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a scary, sharp horror movie that causes your heart to stop more than once. It's definitely better than the crap you often find in the theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and see it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
