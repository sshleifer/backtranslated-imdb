An absorbing exploration of the virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This movie deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality and leaves only subtle traces of which layer of virtual reality you are in, creating an ontological confusion for the viewer to consider. <br /> <br /> Also, it can be seen as a satire of video games - however, the entire movie may fall into the fake of imitative form here. It does not seem unable to escape the video game genre it mimics; thus, satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> A number of interesting ideas cross all the way: the biological mutant is one; the interface between technology and biology, cyborg's desire to transcend reality - and philosophical allusions as the title of Heidegger along with existential issues: ie. the game characters are partially scripts or definite and yet partially free to change their destiny and they wonder how strange it feels in the game. A sign then notes that this existential confusion is like real life and thus again distinguishes between the virtual and the real. Also with the remark that it is uncomfortable to stumble around in a world where you do not know what will happen next time and you are not sure how to play as you have to stumble around just to figure out the goal and the unknown rules. A virtual game in the game is called "TranscendenZ". Also a criticism of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of true violence. Even the hero at any level of ontological existence is confused by violence. They do not like it, but it is exciting and part of the "game" that they fear is genuine. <br /> <br /> The game creator, the god of the system, is murdered in the end; nevertheless, this very scenario is played out in direct parallel with a video game we have just seen - and the spectators believe that it is still only part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not solve the doubt as to whether this is "true", but the point is clear (for me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at all levels. Ontological recapitulates the virtual reality reality. And its common game motifs express as a royal path to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence. Although Cronenberg confirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he argues that he is very much against "the reality ... {Terrorist group's underground name} which is played out in the movie both in the game and in the" real "level." Seems that Cronenberg himself did not think so much about the film, even though his impressive education comes through. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who tries to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the clich√© bourgeois modernist credo - despite the recognized ambivalence there. (My impression here may be due to a limited interview.) Cronenburg still seems to miss the point that his film confuses the mistake of imitating form (here imitating computer games while making a satirical criticism of them, but a criticism that is not able to "exceed" the same form) probably because he actually thinks it is "imaginative" and radical. Yet, the film's imaginative world is less tolerable and more jejune than our own real world. It is still trapped in the computer game's world view.
