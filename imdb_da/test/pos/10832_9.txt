This movie travels on 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 clich√©s than it should be possible. But it still works. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I drove home from the theater, I tried to figure out how it got away with movie clips like the pages of a new manuscript jumping over a beach or the impossible row of random coincidences without the entire audience Stand up and scream: "I've seen it a million times before! And you've pushed beyond the edge of credibility!" But the actors were so enchanting and so full of credible extras that I forgot to break. A friend who saw it with me said it transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in Indiana. All in all, a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety, white and elan.
