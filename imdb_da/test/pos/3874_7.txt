"Back in the Day" is an interesting but insufficient effort. Yes Rule stars like Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who tries to cope with his father's death. He meets with his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who tries to force Reggie into a crime scene. Reggie is also in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali), who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love or crime. <br /> <br /> Yes Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he tries to act. Wing Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and threatens into the role. Preacher Joe Morton is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggies father. He needed more screen time. I don't want to say this, but Pam Grier is pretty awful like Mrs. Cooper. She takes over every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it, but do nothing important for the plot. Ultimately: You should see it for the talented performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the grin of writing and control.
