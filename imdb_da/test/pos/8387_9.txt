I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his film) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on stage in the early 90s with cult classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, he has been a disappointment to some. Well, I'm relieved to say, Tarantino hasn't lost its touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and luckily so. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a Second World War story told only by Tarantino. (Fictitious of course) A war film has not been done as before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Bastards in Nazi-occupied France. Their goal - Killin 'Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He knows as "Jew Hunter" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who testifies to the slaughter of his family. And of course she wants to pay tribute to the Germans for her devastating loss. There are actually three stories here intertwined and linking with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his movie, it is nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so fun. The Basterds are joking, but at the same time very fun, sometimes even fun. The dark comedy aspect plays a big part in this as in many other Tarantino films. Entertainment and hilarity led by Brad Pitt. I found him very fun and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on the screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also good impressions were MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were huge. The film was filled with remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to count itself, but then what? It's not supposed to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with as we should. The film department deserves great props with beautiful vivid colors that highlight the movie. You really have to love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction is his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino among all other things is an entertainer. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, it is incredibly entertaining, shocking, dramatic, exciting and fun at the same time. Jam packed with everything you're looking for in a movie made with the specific Tarantino style it's worth checking out. It is time to experience for yourself which war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
