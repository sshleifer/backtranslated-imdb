Such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such a talent in writers and actors, such a wonderful nature that was the ultimate escapism for them in a landlocked, sun-drenched state. Many of the players went on to bigger things ... another indicator that there was something wonderful unfortunately lost. I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with all my (now ex) husband's very large family in a chorus of 'NO NO !!' Each time it would be taken over by a baseball game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here mentioned that it was up against "Rosanne" ... all my ex and I noticed were always always preempted by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX really wasted something wonderful that you and nothing will ever match it ~! Thanks for the memories of that.
