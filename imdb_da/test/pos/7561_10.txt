Will some companies PLEASE make a (good +) DVD of this movie! ??? Aside from being a wonderful movie about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the only movie I've ever seen - and I've literally spent * years * in my life watching movies! - that captures the essence of the 60's experience (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, traitors, and ultimately its optimal but bittersweet breakdown. And all this is accomplished without being a story of any of the many upheavals of the era, though many are only touched ... as part of the wallpaper. But the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship during approx. 10 ~ 15 years ... and that they survived and deepened despite the tragedies of the turbulent decade. Definitely a joy and must-see movie ... even if you are not an old hippie !!!
