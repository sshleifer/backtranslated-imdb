It is very difficult to come up with new information about JFK Jr., and this fine film had very little of it, but it was a joy to watch. The casting was very good, and the manuscript was also good as a documentary. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. Perhaps a two-part movie could have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationship with his mother, sister and other relatives. Some of the material in the book, "American Son" by Richard Blow would have greatly enhanced the film. WTBS should be applauded to produce such an entertaining film.
