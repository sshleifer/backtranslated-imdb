I found this movement beautiful, enjoyable and uplifting. Originally, the locals in the movie filmed here in Buffalo were intrigued by me. Later I found myself lost in the power of the movie. How do you pay a gift from God? The characters' ability to rise above their base nature and respond to touch from God warmed my heart. The entire audience applauded at the end of the movie. I left the theater with a lil in my step, joy in my heart and hope of humanity. What more can any movie do? Hollywood, I hope you pay attention. America seems like positive, positive films.
