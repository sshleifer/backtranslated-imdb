A well-written play. A moving story showing the middle class English at its best. Some good plays by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but for her credit she does a good job of playing ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes, did not go under the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the movie some flabby story. It has not over dramatized it is portrayal of the English middle class. The movie speed does not decrease even though it is not a paced movie. A good twist in the plot, it is not predictable A lovely English country village setting. I really enjoyed this movie. The places were also very well chosen. If you enjoy movies about relationships, it's one to see. Better to have some tissues ready!
