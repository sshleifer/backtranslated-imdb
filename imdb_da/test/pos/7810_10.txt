There have been very few large comedy films in Hindi Cinema's history. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan are trying their best to persuade each other and woo Raveena. The plot deepens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all wealth. The film is well paced and very fun. Rarely do you come across a Hindi comedy that is both fun and intelligent. This is one of the few movies with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, the checkout office was not successful and we can never see a movie of this caliber again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the movie and has proven his versatility as an actor in this movie. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as an obscure. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma, who is Raveena's assistant / friend, is also fun. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the taste of the movie! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made, and I want them to make more quality films like this one. You want to watch this movie over and over again. <br /> <br /> PS - For those of you who have seen this movie, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri old and new, etc.
