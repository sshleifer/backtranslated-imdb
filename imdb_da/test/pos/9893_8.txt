Peter is top notch, he acts and looks good. Feels like watching a live game, good camera works, and I was sorry it was over. Can't wait until it's on the big screen. Super cast, this could be a big hit. I like the way kids interact as a sister and two brothers, really made me think of my own brothers through a situation like Peter, the happy father who thinks he'll end his life after a big party ... The colors and the sets I was so happy to see Peter not being Colombo, this guy could always act, and now it's a movie that gives him that interval. I recommend taking your family to this movie. Maybe teenagers won't get much of this, no weapons, fast cars, stupid lines, stupid speed jokes ... but your grown-up kids will love it. Good show for one night with them. <br /> <br /> Jason
