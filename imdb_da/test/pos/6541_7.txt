I guess we all, whether we are fans of cars, weed the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it laughs along the road, the noise a 57 Chevy makes when it cries with ecstasy when it tears around the corner and Most of all, the sound bursts like a classic vehicle in flames as it explodes. I am not the greatest car enthusiast of any kind of imagination, but some of the above really make my engine! There is no denial of the importance of cinema transport. It has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences on early cinema (looking out of a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of ​​being transported to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and most luved, it even has its own genre: the exploitation genre. A genre that focuses exclusively on the beauty of cars. In fact, it's just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about the rather unpleasant documentary on Channel 4, where men actually had intercourse with cars. Whatever floats your car, I think. Moving on ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971) for example with his close-ups of the moving car, it's just bumps and baskets (!), It doesn't. does not mean that the car is not the main focus of this movie. In fact, the cars themselves become signs (more on that later). They are objective and fetish as much as the women, perhaps even more so. And holy saints, these cars are something! Every car in this movie (besides them in the background) is simply beautiful ?? artworks there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are somehow giving characters themselves. You actually start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Mostly in the scene where the car is destroyed and burned SPOILER OVER. This has become almost a convention of the reuse generation; the evil 1978 Plymouth rage from CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's custom Lincoln Mark III in CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the chic little Mini Coopers from the Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle in LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course every car from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all of which had their own character. Ironically, this weight on the car often takes over (!) The human characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, where only one human character (the blind character who runs his car with his hearing rather than the sight) has any kind of dimension, the rest being very stock characters. These are all your stereotypical Australian 1980s; big hair, annoying accents, and none of them would look in place at NEIGHBORS, especially Kylie Minouge look-a-like. But who gives a curse? It's just about cars that run and collide! That is it! If you don't like it, you really see the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The movie scenes are definitely the selling point of this movie, and the best thing it has to do with it. They are fast; very quick! And we're not talking about the rather annoying technique that some movies seem to use, where they record the car 'speed' at about 40 mph, and then speed it up. Oooh no! Not with this movie you don't. These cars zoom in with the highest speed in real time? No fancy editing tricks here. So we have speed. Check. What about crashes? Check out, check, check! While there are no cars crashing everywhere, they make incredible BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980) when cars collide in this movie, they collide safely! It seems that they are using reptiles or something similar to building the cars as a small hit and KABOOM they are in flames. It reminds me of THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. <br /> <br /> Between these simply stunning scenes (especially the beginning and the end), there are very few scenes that slowly do everything, and in my opinion fail to add much to the movie. Note: Several exploding cars are needed! But there are a few exceptions here, which are amazing scenes ?? SPOILER, especially the attempt at rape. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a man's movie! A boy's movie! Full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a few breasts thrown in for good measure too. I would recommend this little movie to anyone even though they are keen cyclists (!) ?? It's a great movie that you can just switch off your brain, sit back in your leather chair and set to full volume! I give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon sells this for just over £ 2 ?? It's a really good deal, even though the DVD lacks any special features at all.
