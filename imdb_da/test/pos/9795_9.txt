"Radio Flyer" is one of my most beloved American films. The really good work with two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, (despite the terrible execution of T.Hanks in the beginning and the end ...) with amazing script of DMEvans and powerful and emotional control of R. Donner plus absolutely incredible Peerless Music Score by H. Zimmer allowed "Radio Flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's film rating. <It is such a shame that the very good movie was underestimated by some critics. <br /> <br /> I just can't help waiting to watch it on DVD.
