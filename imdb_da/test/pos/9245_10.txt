Nice doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Although it didn't work out how you wanted with the original movie, you have a great job and good viewing. It is of course how much you put into it. <br /> <br /> This also applies to everyone else. It is great to see the warts and the whole process for the process without being 'too good'. <br /> <br /> Loved it! Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Que pena, the author of 'the original' movie could not appreciate what you have achieved. <br /> <br /> Also love the attitude. Big piece. Looking forward to seeing the next work. <br /> <br /> Continue the bridge! Paully
