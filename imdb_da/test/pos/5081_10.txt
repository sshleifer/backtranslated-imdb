I think this was the most outstanding excitement you've seen for a long time. The research for the film was thorough, the author Kelly Sane has not left any loose ends. The molding was spicy (amazing performances all around). Omar Metwally was excellent. The kinematics are poetic, music thrilling and the overall effect very satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The publication goes into an area that even the media fears to step on. It is really a wake-up call for those involved in espionage and the legal web that is "the war on terror". <br /> <br /> A woman went out of the theater and asked me "is it really happening"? It itself speaks of Gavin Hood's masterful performance.
