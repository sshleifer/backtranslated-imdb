This film is a fairly fair adaptation of Prosper Merimeé's novel. In the novel Merimeé, he himself is a character, Don José is from Navarra (Northern Spain, and historically a Basque zone, they can speak Basque language). They are in Seville (Andalusia, South Spain) and they only speak Spanish with Andalusian accent, in no way they speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she lived in Navarre. You can believe it or not, yet it is the book's version, so you can't be critical of the movie about this, be with the book! You have to note that the novel is by Merimeé and the Bizet opera, and this film is an adaptation from the novel, yet in the opera Don José is still Spanish from Navarre, never he is French. Why so many people think Don José is French? I don't know, but I think the novel and the opera are in French, even though it must be in Spanish. The only important difference between the film and the novel is the one in the movie Don José also kills Carmen's "torero" lover and in the novel he does not (not even in the opera). I guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more fun! I think the movie is pretty good, anyway.
