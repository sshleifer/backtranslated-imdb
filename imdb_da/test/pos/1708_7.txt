As talk shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and as he sometimes becomes good guests, it is a show to turn on occasionally, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other material guest sits across him, it's not that bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal, who absolutely does not provide intelligent information to the country and gives birth to a largely untrained public wishing to hear the latest gossip about movie and television stars . During the OJ Simpson test, every other guest at his show seemed to be related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes it comes out a bit like trash TV - Jerry Springer in an interview with phone calls instead of a live audience. On the other hand, the King's show is certainly much better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a right-political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not a good one. King does not always come out as he fully understands when intellectual material is presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. Always looks like king can't quite handle the problem at hand, ie when he turns to phone calls, maybe someone in the country hopes to have a better question than he has. He may interview someone like David Gergen, but may not have read any of his books. A kind of movie producer who never has trouble reading the script. <br /> <br /> When it's an entertainment celebrity, it's no problem. He may come out as if he is thoroughly knowledgeable, as the material is not material. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice that he has usually seen the star's latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and consideration than reading a book. But if it is like John Dean or Bob Woodward, the King comes a bit like he doesn't completely finish his homework. So away to the phones. <br /> <br /> Looking for real in-depth interviews, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the US. She reads and / or researches everything that is written by or about her guests in advance and has a professional knowledge of these areas. I can't see King doing it right. Granted, he has another audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, who might say more about the American audience than king. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
