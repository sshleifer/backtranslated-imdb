Though the film's premise implies a great "coincidence", the actors all do a dignified job and look good that the story is alive. I found myself rooting for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both and wanting them to unite. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson also have a good role in their roles and do a decent job with the stereotypical friendship. While history tends to jump over time, occasionally the audience may leave a little hungry for missing details, still flowing and avoiding any real confusion. This interesting story has all the elements of a good "chick flick".
