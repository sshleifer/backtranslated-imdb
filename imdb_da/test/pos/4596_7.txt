A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically fun than actually fun (though it has some ridiculous sounds), but it is because it has apparently been cut by the studio to better appeal to precise idiots that are mocking. Many situations must not evolve, there is obviously over-doubling of the exhibition material, and worst of all, explaining ALT (most of which have no explanation) probably because some pre-imaginers did not understand what was happening. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that a longer, better version of this comedy will ultimately surface on DVD, and it will be a cool thing it deserves to be, but even in this tempered and somewhat comical-breathed form It is one of the most memorable films of the year - a cry of disgust at our culture and every way it has been forged, stupid and unloved in the name of appealing to the yahoos. I saw it just after the Land of the Dead, George Romero's latest milking of the only idea that consumers = zombies that are basically the same point Judge does; But where Roman's counter-culture point of view (now zombies = subclass to revolt against the rich) seems hopelessly obsolete, the judge's take fresh, dead and much more disturbing. Just listen to the yahoo in your movie audience who cut it up to President Camachos Union State like their colleagues on the screen and you know we are all doomed.
