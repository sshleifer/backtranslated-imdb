Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer joy in this war comedy if a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family on her Connecticut farm. The problem is that she has no husband, baby or farm she writes in her column, and she can't even cook; Her wonderful recipes were delivered to her by her good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher invites you to Christmas. A plan is quickly planned, with its slothful fiance providing a real Connecticut farm, neighbors delivering a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding scheduled when the publisher doesn't look. But when the beautiful young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications arise as the supposedly poisonous writer falls like a ton of brick to the lovely guy Marineman and vice versa. This is a charming, warm film that balances humor with emotion and is a wonderful presentation for Barbara Stanwyck to show her significant comic talent, backed by such great character actors as the Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, SZSakall and many others. A Christmas dinner dance in the City Hall is a mocking joy to behold, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise to viewers who have seen her mainly as hard, bitch women in femal fatal roles. Really a wonderful movie that has been the time test.
