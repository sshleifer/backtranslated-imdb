Having worked professionally with young girls on the go, I found this movie surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it if a friend did not borrow his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother / Daughter Estrangement, The Underprivileged Choices, Who is the Good Samaritan, The Tragedy is in Every Life and the Many Layers or Relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice buys a gun, we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it doesn't end in clich√©. The cast really "sells" their roles. It is adult material and the sound is a bit too grainy. Let it be 15 minutes to retire.
