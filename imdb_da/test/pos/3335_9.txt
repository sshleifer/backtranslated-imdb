This nifty little film demonstrates the magnificent virtues of a time, place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even want to have. Saint is a paladin with only the best motives, not to say anything of a polished vocabulary and poetry. You do not need to increase the volume or read the dialog box. George Sanders is so charming and yes, the key is that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all masculinity seems good, almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney cannot begin to master the scene as Mr Sanders does (and does without Mr. Clooney's ripple). He could play a snail (witness to the Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good, he was very, very good. Really a man of all reasons and seasons.
