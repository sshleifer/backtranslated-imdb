It came before "the Ten Commandments" "Pharaoh's Land" "Ben Hur", and it is overlooked today. How unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, it doesn't cost! Waltari's novel was so great that only a miniseries could have done it fairly (I hope it will happen one day) .Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian remains intact (another of his books "the secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the holy land). <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the rise of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in stock the world: he asks to return to evil! And he has disciples who eventually become martyrs (the scene where Simmons and the other worshipers of the Sun god are beaten, are visually astonishing and resemble a pagan ball). priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the population, and therefore they are looking for a strong man who can lead the army against the heat and against their dangerous compatriots. Another religion or non-religion we should say is Sinouhés (Purdom), who in two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the sand grain is quite sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum !!) <br /> <br /> There is another fascinating side: the movie resembles a flamboyant melodrama. only for the manuscript (especially the pharoah's sister's (Tierney) final revelation, which takes place "the ten commandments" by two years), but also the splendor of cinematography: Viviani, in his book on Curtiz, speaks of a Baudelairian atmosphere, blue and gold, especially in the scenes involving the prostitute (Darvi), considering her reflection in the water of bath, supreme narcissism. If the hero sees all the signs up, disappears, reappears, but when they come back, they have followed their path, and all the subspecies come together with complete skill. Moreover, as such, it is often the case in "modern" melodramas, the story is a long withdrawal, framed by two short sequences that show Sinouhé an old man who remembers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandals that had great influence, not only in America but also in Europe, especially in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz conducted a spell-binding "pharaoh" (1966) who owed much to Curtiz.
