Outside, this movie is better because of Vincent D'Onofrio (law and order: criminal intention), but this movie is as good as the 1982 edition. In some ways, the 1999 version is better because it is more up-to-date (a decade compared to the age of 27. The actors in this movie were great, like Terry Kinney (McManus from HBO's "Oz") as James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (USA's Monk ) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY). Unfortunately, the dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences, and much of the writing remained the same.There were things that were not in the 1982 version that gave this a boost in drama and comedy, but In the end, this movie was just as great in 1982. Characteristic: Vincent D'onofrio plays Phil Romano was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino, it is a battle between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of James. Rose Shalhoub, and between Martin Sheen & Sinsise and Tom, I want to say Sinise wins.
