My young aunt is unique in many ways. First, this is Hui Ya-Hung's (Kara Hui) first action movie. Second She actually did battle scenes after making an operation done to her a few days before admission. Third, this film is away from the chain. The movie starts with Wang Lung Wei, who tries to take the legacy from his brother. His brother then has Kara to marry him, so Wang can't take the treasure. The story is pretty good, leading everything to the right place. <br /> <br /> In the action, what can I say, has not already been said for films like this or Disciples of the 36th Chambers, Victim, or even the Magnificent Butcher. The battle scenes are what sales film, and this has no trouble doing it. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei engaged in a fight that you must look to believe. Why have these two men not fought each other more than me. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin anything right, but you need to see My Young Aunt to get the full thrill of excitement. My only gripe is that the Yuen Tak was not used as widely as he was used in the 3 Evil Masters, or even the Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) for superb looking movies. 9.2 / 10
