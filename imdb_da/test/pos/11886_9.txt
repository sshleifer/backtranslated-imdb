If you're looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist struggling to find its way into the Americanized Canton. Unlike most "kung-fu comedies", the action scenes are used to enhance comedy, rather than vice versa. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical character of kung-fu movies, where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of some great dramas of honor and respect, less misunderstandings give the signs to shout at each other and begin to strike each other. <br /> <br /> My young aunt, as known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an older country estate to keep his farms fall into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After dying, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. The reason for the irony is that although Cheng is of the same age as Ah Tao, her way is more akin to her status as his step-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely bad), plays guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng completely fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton, complete with makeup, revealing dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won "Best Actress" at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. It is also Hsiao At Best Performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he continued to have a great career in kung-fu comedies, often working with Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athletics and comedy. As the romantic excitement and intrigue build in the second half of the film, his whole face changes. He no longer runs easily through life without care in the world. He becomes the equal man and his cohorts, Kramer, Elaine and George. My only complaint is how suddenly the comic aspects of the movie die under the conclusion. The movie goes from direct farce to dramatic intrigue with little, but a change in random music. But there is some symmetry in it. The film begins to focus on the plot, focused more on the character of Lau Kar Leung, and it also ends in that way. But the final scene returns to the comic roots of the film and gives conclusion to both sides of the film.
