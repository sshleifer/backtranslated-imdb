Publishing presents a very topical material in the form of a very exciting thriller. It's a poignant, not a sermon, movie. Seeing it in an Arab country with a mix of Arab and European audiences gave it an extra level of atmosphere. The audience was completely gripped by the film and gave it a high applause afterwards. The story of an Egyptian, married to an American, depended on the suspicion of relations with terrorist organizations and sent to a friendly Arab country for "enhanced interrogation" (as Meryl Streep's characters in the movie: "We have no torture in the United States") seems to be from the front page of today's news There is a very nice connection between the different characters that appear in the film and the film's pace never falls .. The film's message seems to be (as stated by Jake Gyllenhals character in the film) that by abducting And torturing suspects, you create many more terrorists, the action is uniformly excellent with Streep and Reese Witherspoon in stand-outs.
