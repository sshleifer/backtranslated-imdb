Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, to quote only the most famous. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown films of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema started its crisis that continues today and director Carlo Ausino sounds completely new to my ears (althoug he has directed six films. This is the price Italian directors have to pay for not working in Rome ...). But the film is not that bad. And it is absolutely not correct to talk about "trash can". Ok, the plot is not so original; It reminds me of the Amytville series (the year is the same as "Amityville Possession" by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock", Mario's last work. But you have to think that this is a filmography film (like Mario Bava movie); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the signs; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera's movement. The rest remains in the background. I think the movie works; not so good but working; it's probably better than a lot of Hollywoodian production like "The Haunting" which has a bigger budget but no bigger ideas ...
