I have to warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it, I got "Spanish judges" in February I think. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see it was not re-ordered. But in some way I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor Matthew Lillard (I am surprised no one on reviews mentions), although it is a little low budget, getting enough money to make this movie would be worth using. Man, what good actor. The story of a constructor known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have merchandises called the Spanish judges. If you don't know what Spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for, and this is the first review you've read, I won't even say what they are. I expect it would be a big twist, no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also villains, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a villain named Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a boyfriend who won't even tell anyone his name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (especially Jack) call her "Mars Girl". Everything starts fine, but then it becomes a big game. A game that involves some desire, lies and fraud. There were some overhead effects in it (Matt and Valeria as well as Tamara were not one of them). There were some scenes they could have done better and the score could have been a little better too. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The battle situation could eventually have been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I have to make a correction against NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a beginner. According to this page, she has been running since 1983. For me, and hopefully for others, she is known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the "Hot Shots!" movie. But good review. Although I think it is one of the rare movies I have seen and it is really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give it the character I thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
