One of the best movies I've seen for a long time, exactly in his vision and beautiful and extremely imaginative in his realization. I can't say much without giving it away, and I don't recommend you actually read that much about this movie until you see it. Just look. <br /> <br /> But ah, you have to come up with ten lines of text to get a notification indicated on IMDb. Conundrum. What can I do? Tell you about the movie? Nix. Can't do that. I think I enjoyed this movie just because I saw it without preconceptions. Please do the same. I suppose it can be said: The play is excellent and discreet, and what I have come to love about foreign films is that the movies are actually about the movies, not the stars.
