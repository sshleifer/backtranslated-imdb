Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish society towards the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musical talented sisters give their own prospects for happiness and marriage to look after their aging father. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them. After a few years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast that changes the lives of all invited. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the conscientious proximity of Protestant North Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic South. It is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A deep uplifting movie.
