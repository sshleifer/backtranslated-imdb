I don't think this movie deserves the low rating that most people will give it. It's one of the best "teen" horror movies I've ever seen; And that says a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation for backing it up, signs and plot breaking countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been presented recently. (A clear example is the mindless "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes can be even boring except for the beginning, although some minor light errors can easily be seen. After arriving at the village, the scream begins - a different, twisted kind of horror. <br /> <br /> With the plot and details, goofs are smaller; The characters are the strongest point of this movie, as many clich√©s are broken in it. For example, the two main characters, Nick and Wade, are in no way the idiotic types we are used to; Although Dalton may be better suited to this stereotype, he is not the only one to pay for this lack of awareness. Some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible and for tense moments scattered throughout the film. And finally, and even though everything is decorative explained, it's easy to see that things won't go so easy for the surviving characters. The only flaws I can see and which do not involve continuity (IE, Carly does not find his own cut finger in the unconscious Bos pockets) is the lighting, which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes. Although it is plot and effective, everything is drastic and angry with the protagonists' arrival at Ambrosia, the small village in the middle of nothing, so I give it. It has been quite argued that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?", "Where do they get the adult from?" These would not be rebel issues if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the wax house; their mother worked on making actual wax figures, and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her relentless death is the answer to the second question; What about all the personal things (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of the dead people? By using their third brother as a connection to the outside, it is pretty much argued that Sinclair twins should get the money needed to buy the adult in another world war state. <br /> <br /> So far as I think, the movie deserves much more than it gets, and no one has to lose the chance to see it. Then go see the House of Wax. Right now.
