I originally saw this because I thought it would be the successor to the LION FOR EXTRAORDINARY MEN, and this movie is a completely different thing that goes on here - a comedy! But I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Lord's League is some British television series with some rather weird characters and some sharp humor. This is British comedy, so it's about being very stupid, dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of Germans and French homosexual references. In short, it's very much fun! <br /> <br /> The plot is about the authors of the TV show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters come out of their dimension into the author's dimension to stop it. It's a fun twist and there's lots of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed loudly many times and applauded the bad style of humor. This makes Mr Bean look like the watered down wimp he is. (Rowan is much better in the Black Adder series btw). This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you speak British humor and there are a few similarities, but not as many as keeping it from being its own thing and being fresh. It leans more towards the young and Guest House Paradiso in its comical style. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, check out The Young Ones Series and Guest House Paradiso Movies, and of course I assume the TV Series League of Gentlemen should also be pretty fun.
