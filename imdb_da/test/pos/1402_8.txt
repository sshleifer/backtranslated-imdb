This is a very strange movie for Harold Lloyd - at least in terms of the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s. Instead of a good guy, he and Snib Pollard are all robbing the blind. In a particularly successful king, Chester forbids having lost a "very valuable ring" and later Harold finds it a stooge, also looking for the ring. The ring is, of course, a cheap one that has fallen and then found by Harold, but the greed of stooge is so great, he "convinces" Harold not to say anything and sell him the "valuable" ring, and then they run away for to enjoy their happiness (?). Again and again they find patsies until they meet a woman who herself is a woman (working with a guy who does false cases). She arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole - and has a police officer by making sure they give her the money. <br /> <br /> As luck would get it, the two con men stumble into lady shady business when no one is home. Soon the lady returns and fairs with their minds - releases a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their evil ways. <br /> <br /> Around, this is a very strange and constructed movie, but it is also very fun as the jokes work really well and Lloyd and Pollard do a great team. Plus, while I was scary and strange, I liked to see Pollard dressed as a lady.
