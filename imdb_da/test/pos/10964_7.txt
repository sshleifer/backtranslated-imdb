In many ways, the cinematic career of independent film-making legend John Cassavete is the polar opposite of one such as Alfred Hitchcock, the accomplished study director. Where Hitchcock infamous his actors as cattle, Cassavetes tried to work with them improvisationally. Where each element of a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately, Cassavetes fit less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than what it felt, or what it conveyed, emotionally. Hitchcock's stories were always plot-first stories, with the human element set in the background. Cassavetes puts the human experience first in his own film. If some things were not logical, then it was. <br /> <br /> You can see this from its very first film, 1959's Shadows, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera on a shoe's budget of about $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with Cassavetes workshop repertoire company, and spying as an improvisational movie. The story is pretty simple as it follows the lives of three black sisters Manhattan-Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpet and no account, Hugh Hurd - a washed singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - the younger sister of both. The movie's three main arches deal with Hugh's mistake as a nightclub crooner, and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations in a Manhattan area with their two no account friends; and Lelia's lovelife - first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray) who is unaware of the light rail Lelia's race, even after having the bedding her; Davey Jones (Davey Jones), who may be a misogynist. In the first bow, nothing much happens unless dark-skinned Hugh gets to pinpoint how broken he feels singing in low-class nightclubs, and opening shows for gifts. He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris, but one can tell that he is the kind of man who will continue to seduce with his bad skill, for one time we actually hear him sing, he shows that he is a marginal talent, at best. That Rupert encourages him gives us a glimpse of how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three arches ??. While this movie is better overall than, says Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, who is there knocking on my door? Another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers, has none of the brilliant moments-acting or cinematic - that movie has. It is also not naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in films, although the 1950s era Manhattan exterior on earth is a gem to revive. Shadows can actually be an important movie in relation to the history of the independent film circuit, it is certainly nowhere near a big movie. Parts of it are preaching, badly acted, scenes ending the will-dust, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes cut off in the middle. All in all, it is a very sloppy job - especially the horrible jazz score, which is often out of sync with the rest of the film, as Cassavetes appeared as an instructor, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason anyone can see Shadows is because Cassavetes eventually got better with later movies, and it gives an indication of his later working style. The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preserving as "culturally significant". This is all in keeping with the nature of the Cassavetes long-persecuted, as stated by this quote: "I have never seen an exploding helicopter. I have never seen anyone go and blow someone else's head. So why should I make movies about them? But I have seen People ruined themselves in the slightest way. I've seen people retire. I've seen people hiding behind political ideas, behind dope, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism behind hypocrisy, and I've done all these things myself. "I can understand them. What we say is so gentle. It's mildness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems." That this movie is "culturally important" is true, but that truth is not synonymous with Be 'artistic significant', it is in the difference between these two definitions that great art really thrives.
