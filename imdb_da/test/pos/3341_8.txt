This movie was originally released as a soft "X", apparently with the explicit sex deleted. Later the producers "relented" and smelled it again with the carved scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I think when Kristine was age it was held against her and her promising career was knocked down. I assume it's all in the timing (witness to Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was responsible for Kristine's debacle (we hadn't heard of Nancy Reagan's affairs), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing under Pam's "come out" ". <br /> <br /> The sex is just icing on the cake, both versions satisfy. This naughty musical way is far above the same for others who were released at the same time.
