Although this was a low budget movie and clear last minute, it has some charm that is hard to figure out. I tend to think it's the screenwriter Grant Morris (see Dead Dog) who, despite the combed plot line, injected a fantastic piece of humor, lacking much in today's box office hits. Definitely a must see for a Sunday afternoon laughfest. Talking like a true single girl, and very skeptical, this movie didn't inspire me much, but ignited a little flame of hope for a lovelife. Not my lovelife, as much as my little crazy neighbor's lovelife, who lets him hamster sleep in her bed with her. She can find someone.
