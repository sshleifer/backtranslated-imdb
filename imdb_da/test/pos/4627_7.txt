At 14:37 in a bathroom at an Adelaide high school, a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers change forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking movie centered on pain by being a teenager. The film follows a day in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. While there are a few stereotypes in the mix ?? the beautiful would be the popular girl who deals with body issues, the over-achiever obsessed with his characters, there are several horrors that are so far from the mainstream that you can get, including a social outcast dealing with a brutal disease And a young girl is trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past. <br /> <br /> The film is mixed with documentary-style interviews from the characters, which some viewers may find out in the otherwise seamless story. The pace is also a bit slow, but it fits in with the movie's feeling. The young Australian actors are all stars in themselves, especially Theresa Palmer, who has a heartbreaking performance, earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well shot, with great direction. Some scenes are a little difficult to see ?? especially the five-minute suicide scene, but generally it is a movie that leaves a huge impact on its viewers. It pulls you from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing which of the six main characters is going to end up in the bathroom. In the end it is a beautifully made, but slightly disturbing look at teenage life.
