Waco: Rules of Engagement do a very good job not to draw conclusions for their viewers. It simply presents interviews, footage from standoff, footage of congressional hearings, telephone conversations, expert knowledge, etc. And allows you to draw your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> I have hardly any intention of suggesting that the data provided here was made with 100% objectivity, but it is very convincing. You will not like Koresh anymore when you see this than you did before, but I tend to believe that you will believe as I do now, there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during standoff.
