"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most exciting DVDs I have purchased. Although I am a biased Rush fan of nearly 20 years, I found this performance to be flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds good on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the audience has a constant smile ... it's as if they could catch every single concert I've been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if anything, just to see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the journeys in this rather isolated personal band). For any non-rush fan, this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We've been stubbornly standing by them for years. I have shown this DVD (or parts of it anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush or those who think Rush is less than good because they don't appeal to rock pessimistic masses (ie sex, drugs, and drunk frenzy). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth seeing.
