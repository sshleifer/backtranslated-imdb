When I first saw this movie, I was very impressed with the kind of atmosphere the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. If you see the movie, you will see a lot of sets and customs called freaky and modern again today. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film deals with the old question "What is genuine and what is illusion?". If you see "The Matrix" you will find many similarities. But the two films are not at all comparable, because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertainment. If you prefer the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost my video copy of it. <br /> <br />
