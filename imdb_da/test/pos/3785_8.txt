This movie, as it is now, is much shorter than it was when it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more accessible with two other medium-sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE and THE PILGRIM) which Chaplin released in 1950 'er. Today, SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It's still very fun (Chaplin in disguise as a tree spying on the Germans is so ridiculous, it's hysterical), but it suffers from being put in its own age. Charlie deals with the First World War, a fierce conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (horrible to say) in the 20th century. Chaplin would also live to see that war and would fake it is the chief architects of the GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to modern audiences, because that movie is a talking image. Also, Hitler as a target seems to be more important to the public in 2008 than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS was taking us through the drafting of the tramp, his training, he continued to use trench warfare, and his actual fight against "Huns" on the west front. Much of this is now gone - a segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor examining Chaplin in his office at the draft center) still exists and was shown completely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate because the movie is now about forty five minutes long, and there seem to be gaps in these scenes being completed. What is left is first and foremost, but a survivor wants more ... and feels a bit cheated. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are well into eligible parts, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He had done so before shortly with Charlie for the sale of bonds that gave a militaristic speech before being clobbered by tramp with a big hammer labeled "War Bonds". Here we see that the tramp succeeded in capturing Wilhelm and the general staff at the end. It was only topped by Stan and Ollie who caught the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR PROBLEMS. <br /> <br /> The fun is that Chaplin actually had a big crisis due to his war activities. He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or in 1952, when Advocate General McGranery announced that Chaplin could not return to the United States because he was a hostile stranger (Chaplin and his family were in Europe for a ride - in anger was Charlie resided in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made a COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special career "Oscar" in the 1970s). Because he was not American, he could not be made by the United States. So he sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) U. S. War Bonds. But in Britain, tens of thousands were killed in the battlefields of World War I, and the public was disturbed in Chaplin as they are considered a "slacker" and a prison. Chaplin eventually overcome this, but the remains of anger followed him until he died. This does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a movie, but it suggests why Chaplin did not make another modern war film until 1940 and a valuation target.
