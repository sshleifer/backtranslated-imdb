I hadn't planned to watch this movie, but I wasn't disappointed when a friend pulled me together. Although there are no real surprises here, the boys are reasonably good at their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of movie, and there is a fairly constant stream of jokes here, with a few classic moments, with highpoint likely to be a brilliant feedback to what the guys were like in the 1980s. I also read elsewhere that the end was a disappointment, but I found it refreshingly different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie won't change your life, but it's probably laughing there to keep you entertained all the way.
