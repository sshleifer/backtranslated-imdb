These cartoon authors are incomparable with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see here is an island prison with the following written over its large gates: "Alka-Fizz Prison - No nose is good nose." Inside the prison is the first sign we see is "Welcome: get a seat." They then show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> However, Corny is wise as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With the pen in his hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it! In no time has he crossed the United States, zipped up through Canada and is located in the northern part of the country. That's where we can see the Canadian royal mounted police and of course our very Droopy, known here as "Sgt. McPoodle." He's tasked with catching the big criminals from Alka-Fizz. So with his faithful little blue horse, he goes out into the heavy snow to track the desired wolf. From that point on we get the normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter does .... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny synagogues. Droopy even jumps out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. There is nowhere the wolf can walk - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the pristine "Sgt. McPoodle." No one, by the way, in the story of the comics may also have more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his nemesis! His scream, face and body stretched in horror each time is a big part of sight gags. <br /> <br /> You think this one-joke cartoon would be monotonous, but it doesn't. There are several good things from Tex Avery and the band, only one of 24 cartoons in "Complete Theatrical Collection" DVD with wonderful looks restored images.
