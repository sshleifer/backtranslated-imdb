Dirty War is definitely one of the best political, governmental and well-written television dramas in the 25 years. <br /> <br /> The action is amazing, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the true side of why we're not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological, and radiological terrorist attack on US soil. Dirty War should be made into a big movie - It's so good! I highly recommend this amazing drama to anyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This television drama reveals how British Intelligence (MI5 & MI6) is trying to reveal a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims - England's involvement in the Iraq war. The scenes in different parts of London, England are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> Dirty War is a must see !!!
