The martial arts films were huge in the 60s in parts of Asia, but with the increasing popularity of the infamous Shaw Brothers movies, America was bound to capture. This film was the first to be presented in America during the Warner Bros. label, and it actually started a craze here that flooded the 70s with martial arts films. Many of the movies to be followed would be pale in comparison, but some were great, and many like Enter The Dragon (who came out shortly afterwards) became great success stories and made superstars out of these warriors. Fast forward almost 40 years later, and this film still holds up. Most Shaw Brothers movies are as good today as they were left, and it was said that no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by The Shaw Bros again today. <br /> <br /> I like to think martial arts is like porn, and no one sees porn to the plot just the action, the same goes for the MA movie and most of them are just a bunch of big games with little history, this is an exception. It doesn't have a great story, but there is one there. <br /> <br /> The most important guy played by Lo Lieh really stands out among karate movie heroes. He never screams and he never fights just because he can, he is often seen as weak and less of a giant than most, but when he has to fight, he is cursed well the greatest living. I really loved this character. Many of the evil guys were memorable and the battle scenes were just so unbelievably presented. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the huge Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 as the greatest martial artist movie star ever, he was also in the above mentioned Enter The Dragon. <br /> <br /> The production that I have said over and over is wonderful, you can't beat the Shaws, the direction was somewhat unlike I've seen much in the 70's movies, the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands as he does the Iron Fist, it's pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was also fantastic. Martial arts films were to Asia, what westerns were to Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries that made these films all had genres, but the Japanese films were what made waves there as spaghetti westerns were in Italy. With their many differences, the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers Of Death, the matches were easily compared to Sergia Leoni's cowboystand offs, and the music bound the genre as well. The music here borrowed a little from Ironside, but it was still very original. Many movies were inspired by this, and when I see it, I can see everything from The Master Killer to Blood Sports after being influenced. The most obvious movie that was influenced was Kill Bill, which for me is the greatest of all times. Many of the sets used Quentin are complete replicas of those seen here, and he used the music from this movie, even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the battle scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese dew at the end of this movie. I have seen many martial arts movies, a couple just better, but it's a MUST SEE for fans of the genre. You can't go wrong here. The movie starts slowly but 15-20 minutes into what it downloads and does not lower.
