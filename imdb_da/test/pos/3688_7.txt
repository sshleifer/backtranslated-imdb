I'm a big Rupert Everett fan. I love Kathy Bates, so when I saw it available, I decided to check it out. Synopsis doesn't really tell you much. In parts it was silly and touching, and in some parts it was quite hysterical. <br /> <br /> Any person who is a big fan of any personality will find some small identification features of the protagonist. (Of course, there are many, they don't want to, but it's supposed to) <br /> <br /> If you like any of the actors, give it a watch, but don't look for something too dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I can also mention that you can see how darn high Rupert is. I think I knew he was 6'4 ", but he seems even more in this movie. He even seemed to bend a bit because of the other character heights in. He is tall! I mean high! And for you Rupert fans there is a frame on the chest ... amazing!
