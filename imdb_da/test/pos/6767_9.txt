OK, so I'm usually not one who runs out and rents foreign films ... especially foreign dark comedies. I think on the one hand I can count on the number of movies I found really fun from the beginning to the end. This movie will be added to the short list. Even dark comedies right out of Hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one had my eyes riddled with tears. My pages hurt. I haven't laughed so hard for a long time. This movie was recommended by my mother and I don't think I would have dreamed of seeing it if she hadn't raved about it. Don't be afraid to read under your movie - you will miss a hilarious well-behaved flick.
