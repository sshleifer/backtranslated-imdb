I know the girl who did skating for the maid. She once dated my brother and she was always really nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, ca. 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha I used to go there on country trips when I was in primary school. It was a little strange to see it in the movie. I also had the chance when the film filmed to be an extra because there was a casting call to them in the mall. But I didn't want to go to it at the time because I wasn't interested in acting. Now I totally wish I did. It was such a great movie that I bought it from Ebay. It never came out here (which is a bit strange when it was partly filmed here), so I was thrilled when it came. I really loved the history line and the polar bear was a little sweet. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away :)
