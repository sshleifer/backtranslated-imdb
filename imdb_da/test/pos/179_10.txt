Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) wishing to travel on gold in Alaska. The only person hiring her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes to her is an adventure she will never forget. This television movie was just amazing. The action is # 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milan) and I also learned some information about Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie to anyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
