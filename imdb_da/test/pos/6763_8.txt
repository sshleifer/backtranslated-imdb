It's a wonderful movie about people. Strange people. The characters in the film all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the movie's plot very absurd; but it doesn't make the movie worse, only better, because it's shot in a kind of fantasy-like way, so nothing is right. This review may sound a bit weird, but then again the movie is not quite normal ... It's also a fun movie on many occasions. If you haven't seen it, see it. Enjoy!
