The actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The sum of all fears) making an above-average screen version of the novel, Everything Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of travel and self-discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp directions with a story that enriches and enlightens the soul. Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's small memorabilia and sealing them in plastic lock bags to show them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved her life many years ago. So Jonathan begins a long journey to find this mysterious woman in Ukraine without knowing if she is still alive. He listens to the help of a brash, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to drive him to his goal. First, the trip hits dead ends and false leaders, but as the group approaches its goal, the men find themselves in the midst of the ruins of a dark chapter in history reminiscent of war and former ghosts in a non-existent city. There they find their own destiny and are forever changed by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it was being directed by someone who knew how to make the most of his actors. At times, the film is spoken in Russian and acts as a foreign film. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. This is a thought-provoking feature of a man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonat's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It is a tale of bondage over the long haul and the guilt one must bear for life. At the end of the movie, these characters have all experienced life that changes events that will permanently blend their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatization and also cleanse the soul. It is also about your heritage and how others see an event or a person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these people will have changed in the end of the film, which is a tribute to a story that is told. The story is deceptively simple. It acts as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves a large number of layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. The ending is a little surreal with its déjà vu feeling. Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Spotless Mind of the Spotless Mind)) has chosen a wide variety of roles ever since his splash in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here he does a good job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin do better than Alex and his grandfather. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (That's right), is fun as a hard loyal companion. <br /> <br /> The extra music score of Paul Cantelon is a humorous compliment to the thoughtful nature of the movie. Editing is effective as past and present images are connected and transferred effortlessly. The kinematics of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is appropriately strong and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its success. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that occur in the last half of the movie make it a good drama but a little too random. We never fully understand the entire background of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. Likewise, Jonathan's shiny star and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man. At times, the film feels a bit discouraging and depressing, as more terrible revelations are exposed. But these are less criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good ideas and interesting themes about memory and closure. The fact that Schreiber not only instructed but adapted the manuscript to this worthy record of history is a tribute to his talents and promising future potential.
