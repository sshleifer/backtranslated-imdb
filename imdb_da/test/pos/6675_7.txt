Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be resident in a remote planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is trying to help him, constantly trying to understand Prot and finding out if he really is from K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't really fit into a particular genre. A large part of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another sub-fantasy, plus, thereby adding a comedy and you are starting to get what K-PAX is about. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still gives some good words to the plot, which may still surprise you as they did to me. No special effects or graphics accompany this movie and there is no need to have them, but the music in the movie is amazing. A techno soundtrack along with a fantastic piano piece makes the K-PAX sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes exciting. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) from Planet K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, making Spacey a great job in the lead. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges are also excellent in his part. Bridges and Spacey fit together well, and after all, they should both have had great experience. The wife of Dr. Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays his part well and shows the frustration of having her husband gone and so dedicated to her patient. Alfe Woodard plays Dr. Powell's colleague Claudia Villars, we do not really see Claudia too much, but in general she puts a good performance. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is rated PG-13 for "a sequence of violent images and concise language and sensuality" and it covers it. As far as "violent images" go, we do not see too much. A few people have a little blood on them, but that's all. The language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" word, and a few uses of the Lord's name in vain. Not so bad really. The sensuality part is right from when Prot explains Dr. Powell, how rendering works on K-PAX, nothing terrible, just something if it feels like "having your nuts in a scrub." Not so bad at the content level of a PG-13 movie, it could have been much worse. In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It won't disturb you, but it's fun and fun to watch. It has some fun parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and you know what I mean. It's a story about a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? All in all, a good rental for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax, K-PAX is a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've already seen this movie like it and are thinking of getting the DVD, I'd highly recommend it. It has lots of extras to look through, and even an alternative end and deleted scenes. 8.10
