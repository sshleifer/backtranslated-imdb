I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid's installments. Although my favorite is still the Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth part of the movie series was in line with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, karate students are a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path than a male teenager. Maggi finds it a little more challenging, but rises to the apartment. The plot phrases are credible and predictable. I found out that the evil ones are small dimensions, but this weakness is present in all parts to varying degrees. The camera's work is impressive and throws over some beautiful scenes from time to time. The Zen monastery is both tight and charming. The Zen monks add a bit of humor and ease to the narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes that are a humorous counterweight to the more serious Zen archery scene earlier. The quality level of the film is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to your heart". The lessons in the film are valuable and valuable to learn. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and be careful not to overpower the struggling part. All in all, I enjoyed it.
