And Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a rude little rodent, neglects his pilothouse and evokes his path in film history. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a struggling young genius debuted the world's first successful synchronous sound comic. There would be nothing left for either Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse. Financial battles would remain, but essentially the world was their oyster bed and Mickey would eventually compete with Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. As an entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch and offers fine work by animator Ub Iwerks and shows a Mickey with all the passion and indifference of a small child. He has to deal with a tyrannical skipper (Pete, without his peg), he had been shown in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a wisecracking parrot (for some years it would be a Duck) and a cute little mouse named Minnie . Together, the two rodents create soft music on the living bodies of a goat, cat, goose, pigs and cow (a precursor to Clarabelle) - all of which happened to be comfortable aboard the steamship. The audience rejoiced for more, and the pattern was set for the subsequent mouse comics in the next few years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901 -1966) was always fascinated by pictures and drawings. As a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he outlined livestock on paper sheets; Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew cartoons on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with the artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio with animated commercials and small cartoons for the local cinemas. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke the ground in placing a living figure in a cartoon universe. Business transitions sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, when Walter's elder brother Roy became his lifelong business manager and advisor. When a mildly successful series of Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was pulled away from the distributor, Mickey Mouse's character jumped into Walts imagination and secured Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a huge audience's success with its use of synchronized music. The SILIG SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of wonderfully talented animators quickly defeated new full-color territory, illusions of depth and radical advancement in personality development, an arena where Walt's genius was invincible. Mickey's fake, naughty behavior had caught millions of fans, but he was soon joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's greatest movie dream movie. On a blizzard of judges, Walt held endurance and in the coming decades happy children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that the child's simple message and very hard work always pay off.
