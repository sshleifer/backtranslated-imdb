I first saw "The Knowledge" during a Thames Television marathon at one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles when it was new. I enjoyed it very much with the danger UXB. <br /> <br /> Being a movie I saw over 20 years ago should keep me so good in my memory is a testament to its originality and the quality of the cast from the cast. <br /> <br /> I searched for a DVD copy here in the US and found no one. I finally played and bought a British DVD from Ebay and was pleased to find that it has no region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
