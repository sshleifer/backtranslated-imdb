This movie is getting a bad start. An incredible corny monologue is immediately followed by a brilliant, truly amazing spacecraft crash. Then it goes downhill again as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (except for the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) fit almost all too well into the role of the monster feet. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, which prevents the audience from knowing the signs at all. You feel that if you saw "Deep Blue Sea", meet "Silence of the Lambs", minus the good bits. And unfortunately the whole thing is trying to be "Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter" during daylight. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he's no Anthony Hopkins, and he annoys annoyingly like the wise, hypercule psycho. There is at least one very good scene with an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you might as well have cut the first thirty minutes or so ... But then things take a turn. I just can't clarify the moment, but soon the movie gets much better. It also feels less carved - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying, and soon he is a show steal. In fact, when the first monsters appear, the movie is quite entertaining. When the night falls, it's great. Exciting, scary and exciting. And even the character development of most protagonists is well done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at first, you're in good entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition, visuals are eye-candy, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10 if only ....)
