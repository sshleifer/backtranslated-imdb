This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters novel was so lovingly done, I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. Not since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I've seen such performance by the leading actresses, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and that's what comes to the audience! The supporting actors were well selected, they also made a good ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think history is just about a lesbian relationship - no, it's just a part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has some additional surprising phrases. So the film should be interesting for just people or guys like me too.
