I saw this movie the day it opened in NYC, at Ziegfield. At that time, Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. She had a few hits, was very good in "Desperately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is that girl?" gives Madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She makes the madcap / heroine routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne is very well cast as the man around to see all the shenanigans. <br /> <br /> The story involves a big cat named Murray, a bride to be who has slept with every cabbie in NYC, a mean father-in-law, and a key. There are many car gates and police that pull their way. All elements in a screw-basketball comedy intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is seen briefly. He shares a glass of champagne with the wires and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rainforest and everything. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Madonna movies (those I have been able to tolerate anyway), this is amazing. On its own, it's not that bad. 10.6. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was miserable.
