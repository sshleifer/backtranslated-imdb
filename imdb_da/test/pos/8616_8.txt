I like Breillat's movies, but this is the best I have seen in balancing the animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric and the script is fantastic - especially considering that it must be on a set of Breillat's films. You do not have to agree with her on everything to get a lot from this. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a male instructor with Jeanne's openness - not impossible but a little bend. The unannounced sexual undercurrents, which are always present when people come together to do something, are held up to bright light here, but not a cold light.
