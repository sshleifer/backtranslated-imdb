I gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. If it had just had a teenager, it would be more I would have given it 10. <br /> <br /> It is nonetheless a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who played a beautiful old floozy, should have been awarded Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (Alice's portrait), as I had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body I think I've ever seen in movies. <br /> <br /> In a battle to pick up old car, Alice has turned on from Florida for a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the movie) and high hopes of going to college that she and her family can't really afford. <</ p> </ p> <p> She seems quite vulnerable out there alone on the road, and of course she meets some rough-looking characters and shortly after, it is discovered that there is a hole in one of her tires. <br /> <br /> At that time, she is at a rest and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an elderly couple traveling in an RV. <br /> <br /> They go south to Florida and take her under their wing, but is it right that they present themselves? Flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new life lessons.
