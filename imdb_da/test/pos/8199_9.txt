I will admit my ignorance of this movie's existence until I saw it announced on a cable exit. I was very impressed with the film's Romanist structure. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. I think this is about the quality of the movie. It was visually stunning. The action was visually sensing. The Chinese theater traditions used to enhance the dialogue are so convincing after seeing Western films, where the actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes right at you, without many explosions to get your attention. It is human action that is so affective here. The added benefit of the film teaching me the history of one of the world's major tourist attractions, China's first Qin Emporer, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. This is a movie I can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.
