I watched this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought the video and saw the countless times. Every time I see it, I can get something else out of it. It is a true proof that you will hold onto a good life, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to stick to the past, even the young characters like Charlotte won't have things to change. The overall tone and mood are excellent. Cast is excellent with all stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, such as Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law: Criminal Intent of mine favorite programs). It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
