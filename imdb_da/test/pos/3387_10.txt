I have 2 complete sets from time life, this is my favorite movie all the time. Love all actors and actresses. Awsome picture .. LOVE Patrick Swazy. This is the movie that showed his true talent. But still he doesn't get credit for the screen he preformed! Much credit has been missed in these films.Love the way they portrayed on the dry and dusty monologues of the civil war. Make it one of the greatest love stories of all time and show through all life's life connections, what does true freindship mean? ..How 2 split countries split but still everything and all freindship remained solid, even though the war shared kinship and freindships. But throughout it, they remained and taught us the viewer how true freindship ships can still remain until the present day! Simply the best..Gone with the wind does not compare to this movie.Patrick Swazy at his best. After watching this movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy .. And have been following her career ever since. Have all their films after he made north and south!
