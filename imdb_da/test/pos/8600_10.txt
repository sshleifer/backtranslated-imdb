In the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (ie Typhoon Ondoy), I thought of myself to look again at "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), Shohei Imamura's scary black and white masterpiece on destruction and aftermath of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima at the end of World War II. The destruction and impact of both disasters (war and typhoon) can vary in degree and quality, but trauma and scars (physical and psychological) are still there. <br /> <br /> It is a testament to the power of a movie that its images remain as powerful and indelible as they were first seen. It's just that the difference now in my case is that seeing these pictures has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and strength due to a first-hand experience of an almost monumental weather disaster. There is a sense of kinship so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His film is always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthliness: "The Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Hot Water Under a Red Bridge" (2001), his two Palme d'Or winners "Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Eel" (1997) to name a few. Given the mood of his film, who would have thought he once served as assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese movie's most tight and minimalist film maker? But then it is Oz's strict formality and housekeeping that Imamura opposed. <br /> <br /> But again, with "Black Rain" one can unmistakably mark Ozu's imprints. The father (or father's picture) intends to see his daughter get married before the time runs out on both of them, and the silence and tranquility of the scenes show all family members together (especially dinner scenes or in Ozu's film lexicon, tatami) is something that the honorable master filmmaker will train in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). Essentially, the overall poor and conscious quality of "Black Rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanal chaos and instinctive drive of Imamura's entire filmography. However, it is not to say watching the movie would not be a completely disturbing experience. "Black Rain", as appropriately described by American film auditor Leonard Maltin, is "filled with scary black and white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura does not take any action to show the immediate and graphic horrors of the atomic bomb, one after the other (burnt bodies, drooping flesh, goose dead, fires and dirt everywhere, madness everywhere). An attack on the viewer's senses, surely it is with Takashi Kawamata's gloomy photography (he made the lens of Yoshitaru Nomura's criminal case "Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's chilling score (he did the music in classics like Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and Masahiro Shinoda's "Double Suicide" "). Even during the supposed "quiet" phase of the film (ie five years after the atomic bombing), one can still never have a sense of satisfaction and order, where discomfort and pain are still strongly felt by the survivors, not just in the form of physical health. but more in the form of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, which now undoubtedly appears, has been destined to carry the legacy of the bomb as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> I wrote a piece about "Black Rain" a few years earlier (published in IMDb.com) but only to Volker Schlondorff's magnificent "Tin Drum", another movie dealing with monumental human stupidity and global disaster. Moreover, it has never been my practice to write twice about a movie that I already wrote something about before. It is in the light of the recent weather disaster that ruined our country that I was asked to visit and re-write about this remarkable Imamura movie, as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the movie and the recent event with account for imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the long-term scars and wounds caused by extensive destruction (whether human or naturally induced). There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", each in their respective countries), and "Black Rain" is among them if No more, for both its unapologetic and gloomy portrayal of individual and common disintegration caused by nuclear disruption and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis. <br /> <br /> A few weeks from now, another Hollywood Hollywood disaster movie, "Roland Emmerich's" 2012, will finally frame (no pun intended) big screen. As we all know, this American director's mass of "disaster / apocalypse" movies - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The Day After Tomorrow" - no purpose other than being a pure entertainment value without any real insight into nature and the wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and human condition is affected. I wonder how this "gigantic" movie would take advantage of the trauma, disorientation, and anxiety still experienced by our people because of the recent weather disaster. To say that this flick is a precautionary story will probably not be more than an overstatement. <br /> <br /> But yes, I still want to see "2012".
