I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was totally impressed with the movie's gothic atmosphere and tone. As a big fan of all vampire-related things, I am always happy to see a new variation of vampire myths, in this case a ghoul-like creature lying in a Lovecraftian second dimension. The director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject by means of the decadent art scene as a background for what is essentially a story of love that spans time and space - the pure love of friendship as opposed to the desire for blood and life of the vampires in history. The characters in the story are transported to a different dimension using a mind-altering substance where a form-changing vampire creature seems to give them their hearts desires as they drain them from the essence of their lives. There are some analogies to drug abuse and loss of control and how it affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the 2 main characters in history, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive hunks, always a plus in a vampire story for the female viewers! The special effects posing and creativity effects were well-finished, and putting the design of the vampire dimension was very effective. All in all, it is fun to take on vampire myths and is recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with little intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more erotic and nudity, as it would have looked after the plot and the themes.
