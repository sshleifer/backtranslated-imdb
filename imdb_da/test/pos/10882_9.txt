This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, it is only fun to make remote and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game is levels where you have to save Natalya, so you have to limit your use of remote mines at these levels and it gets pretty boring. The graphics do not reach as high as Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you speak a great multiplayer in a 1st person shooter, go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play multiplayer yourself.
