Ghoulies IV may not be the best of the series, but it's not that bad if you don't take it seriously, then you can enjoy it. It's nice to see Peter Liapis returning as Johnathan Graves, who has stopped using magic and has become a Detective, but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The reason is about a woman named Alexandra who is Johnathan's ex-girlfriend who breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, she uses the pearl she wakes up her girlfriend by the name of Faust, who is Johnathan's dark side, but he needs the pearl so he can enter the real world and John sent to hell. Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem so she has to find a new one as she leaves the gateway still open and two small ghoulies named Little and Dragon appear. They are not the true Ghoulies as they resemble guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask, but it does not matter as they are humorous in parts. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan as he can return them home to walk around causing chaos as they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys as opposed to those in the previous films. I found Ghoulies IV to be good, but this movie must not go to everyone, check it out if you like low budget film like Troll 2.
