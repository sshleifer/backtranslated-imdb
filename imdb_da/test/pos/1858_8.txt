As this film unfolds, you begin to feel the confrontation with human existence. If you ask questions, inner wars, unresolved puzzles about the meaning of life, then you will feel this movie with every piece of your body. Charles Darwin begins a war with a completely predictable ending. War with God. His theories resemble the fact that God has nothing to do with mankind, has nothing to do with the amazing world we live in. Savage, hard, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the mind of the character cast in a universe of material truth who slowly pushes hope for God out of his mind. Nevertheless, the film, like Charles Darwin, still sees wonder and beauty beyond God in the universe of infinite Evolution.
