This was a wonderful little movie that was really creative and fun - something you see too rarely in movies. The film begins in Russia just after the fall of the Communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has not yet improved as the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing are still moving the poor residents of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of gloom and insecurity comes an idealistic music teacher. He is among them without a home, and he finally gets a letter from the government telling him that he has a small room in a nearby apartment. When he arrives, the place is a mess, but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a nice party. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady who goes out of the huge wardrobe in the room (I was half expecting Lucy and the other children from LION, WITCH and WARDROBE to come out, but they didn't). They are too shocked to do anything at first, but decide soon to investigate. Instead of just being a closet, the wardrobe opens to Paris! How the residents of the apartment respond to this magical gateway is really exciting. Some, like the music teacher, are excited and in awe. Most of the others are more pragmatic and are most concerned about looting everything from Paris before the gate closes once and for all! These Russian thieves are horrible people - greedy, coarse and crude, but deeply deep --- very deep - are hearts of gold. I like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on capitalism. Initially, they run to get everything they can, and only later do they show a depth - but they work most like guests at JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has many twists and turns out to be fun and fascinating. About the only negative is that because of some harsh language and a nude scene (albeit a very fun one), this is not a movie for kids. This is a real shame, as with some very minor edits, it could have been a great family movie.
