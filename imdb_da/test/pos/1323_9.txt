Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now, I think Paul Schrader is the best scriptwriter at all times, but I don't really like the movies he's directed at what I've seen (except for this and affliction), but it's a fantastic, disturbing and strong 3- dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most famous writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of them in a very artistic way. The action is amazing, so is the photography and a perfect score of Philip Glass. Although confusing the first view, this is one of the few movies that gets richer with each view. Really an underrated gem of a movie.
