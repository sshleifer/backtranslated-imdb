Oh, Batman Returns, is it possible to get a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns it came pretty close! We have great actors and a huge plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he is still great than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just big and scary! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more affectionate community of Gotham City, celebrating Christmas time with the Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreates his lovely secretary Selina, who is too much in her office, causes him to push her out the window hoping she will die and never reveal the information about knowing the penguin and trying to get him to to love in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin, who is looking for his parents who left him, and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous actions and stopping the mayor from destroying the city too? <br /> <br /> You'll have to watch! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, despite the fact that the first is the true classic, this one still takes you a ride. And come on, I think we have Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You want a blast! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
