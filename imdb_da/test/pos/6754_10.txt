I still can't believe that starevich made this movie back in 1934. Animation is simply perfect, and what's great about it with all the advanced technology we have today, there are few animation studies capable of producing one. little gem like this one. It has it all: a great story, beautiful chracters (though it is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects ... yes it is certainly not a child's movie, but it is a must-see for anyone who is serious interested in animation.
