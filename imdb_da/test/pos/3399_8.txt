Sweeping drama with beautiful sets, costumes and performances ?? although some people channel Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men try to maintain a friendship despite family and local affairs. Nice villains ?? You want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one ?? both good and bad. Secondary stories are also well-developed. More cameos of great stars of earlier eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Curl up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink choices with it. A blanket and a cat would be optional.
