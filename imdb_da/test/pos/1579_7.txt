GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a sequel in the sense that it has nothing to do with the first installment, I found SUCCESS to be a little stronger and better assembled than VIRGIN ... but then again it doesn't really say much. Beauty starts out as a rather rough and even-used movie. A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman capturing and beginning to rape her in a quite brutal way. As this nastiness takes place, the maid tells the girl that they did the same for her sister and sold her to slavery in Africa and that they will do the same for her. They shoot her up with some drugs and rape her a little more. She somehow comes away and ends up in a clinic where the nurse listens to her sob story. The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her past experience and committing suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the young lady's history, decides to avenge himself on the gang by seducing one of the lower boys and trying to hypnotize him to get him to kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan goes back, so now Mrs Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is being subjected to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (some rather rapeseed rape rape accompanied by the necessary cancer). She is also drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly unhappy victim ----- it becomes a raging hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON !!! (no sh! t, that's what really happens!) This is where BEAUTY really goes off with some of the most beautiful bad drafts - including a very nice breast rape that looks like a cross between Alien and a bad porn and my favorite - a killing of the head because of the demon vagina (complete with the demon's vagina slime ...) to be seen to be believed ... Absolutely some promising things going on in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still very heterogeneous . BEAUTY feels almost like two different movies being forced together in a non-compatible way. Still, I have to give the movie credit - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic, and kill scenes are just off the wall. A solid 7/10 for another crazy J-horror "classic".
