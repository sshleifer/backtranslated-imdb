Over the years I have seen this movie many times from watching it on "HBO" and I now own a copy on DVD. I have to say it is very memorable and entertaining in the meantime it is also interesting and educational. Like any TV fan can relate to the time of the early 90s when the time came to replace Johhny Carson's TV show for "The Tonight Show", who should it be Jay or Dave? This original HBO movie "The Late Shift" remains true to form and portrays the right events very well, showing behind the scenes the battle between the network leader of NBC and CBS and even ABC, they all fought for Jay and Dave. The actor makes it seem right, as very little actual television footage is shown to real people, as the actors depicting Leno and Letterman make it seem so real. I haven't read the Bill Carter book, so I don't know if it was true for the pages, but I've enjoyed this movie a lot over the years. From the moment it starts showing CBS entertainment heads who see Leno sub to Johhny, and they decide that they will come in on the late night game. But when Carson announces its unexpected retirement, NBC wants to be loyal to Leno, but conflict arrives when Letterman wants a crack in the castle at. 11.30. It was fun to see the wacky meeting with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams), which makes every network consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see Johhns scene by telling Letterman by phone in a direct way to go from NBC and consider CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was amazing when Johhny Carson couldn't be compared to his portrayal. And lots of excited moments were delivered by showing the bickering and firing of Leno's talent manager Helen, which the NBC head forced him to do. Overall great movie showing what TV really is and it shows that networking is power and money hungry while it turns out it's a cutthroat business. Obviously, there is no business like show business. Great work from HBO very memorable and a clock anytime it showed the true story of the Sennat wars.
