The first time I ever saw this was at a friend's house. It ended in his parents' hands with a fluke; some videostore / bike repair shop !! went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet are pants where we laughed. <br /> <br /> I've seen historical documents like the Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from outer space, and they still remain good runners in relation to this. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after the first contact, it is now considered the best cult movie of all time (in my circles); I've shown it to all my friends ... We now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category: the non-taxpayer. <br /> <br /> It cannot be explained or reviewed in any normal way because each scene, every take, every move contains at least one error in editing, dialouge, directing, etc. For any cult movie buff, this is the ultimate prize , the pearl of all gems. Raiting: In terms of craftsmanship, it cannot be judged because it itself would be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for pleasure, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen; More fun than any comedy ever made past or present. Anything less than a 10/10 should be considered an insult to good sense of hum ours.
