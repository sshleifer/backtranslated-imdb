I was very surprised to hear that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this movie. She seemed very lifeless and completely educated by the 54-year-old Bergman in the scenes, where they sit next to each other. If it was written today, I think Bergman and the young man Ivan would have merged (Ingrid is so hotter than Goldie ...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by Matthau and Hawn will be omitted in the cold. But it was written in the late 60's and feels like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the park. However, Matthau's one-liners, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's elegant performance make it quite comfortable to see.
