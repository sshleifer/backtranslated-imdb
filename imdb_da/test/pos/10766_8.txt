I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said it was "sick" so they couldn't see it. I think if you discover its character R then you will be prepared for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the play is amazing. Just can't be a prude to appreciate it! Basically, it's about a mother who makes drugs and wants to be clean, so she calls a very wealthy old friend, and he moves them to his property and crazy things happen. I think it's a drama. I'm just so sick of people who don't like movies because of curse or nudity. It's the world we live in. Of course, you're not familiar with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. And that's rated R. So, it should tell you from the start that it's not all peachy happy rainbow. I liked it. I think you will too!
