I watched this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a sweet story (not to mention fun because of the supportive cast!) They never make movies like this ... ever! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) finds out her boyfriend's wife's death and that she has the late wife's heart and she screams: "WHAT WAS GOD DRAWING?" I think everyone (no matter who you believe in) has thoughts like this once in a while. But while it is very juicy, it can just make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Suk) The comic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will just make you jump up (especially in the above scene it's terrible and yet so much fun!). They make a good couple and I hope to see them again in something soon. 10/10 stars
