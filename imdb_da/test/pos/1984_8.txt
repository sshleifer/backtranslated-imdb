WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's always abnormal film is definitely an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films will probably like 'eXistenZ', but it's certainly not one for the squeamish. All the usual items are here. A game pod made from the skin (hooked in your back), bloodstain, a gun made of bones and a manic mechanic just to name a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just odd in others. But one thing the movie has is undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? Weirdness It Makes A Point - Virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character shoots a death claiming he was "annoying" (assuming she was still in the game). But it leaves the question of whether it really happened or whether it was an event in this amazing life-like game. "eXistenZ" leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was a dream ?? or was it angry. It's a clever surprise and answers to a few questions, but it was a little disappointing to give the whole movie up to this moment. In just 97 minutes it could have been a little longer as well. In a peculiar way, the film raises moral problems, but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first major role for a while. But her character does not have enough qualities to make her jump out of the screen or even give her a sympathetic character. Jude Law, on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through his perspective. <br /> <br /> "The eXistenZ" is far from flawless, but it is definitely a movie experience to remember. There are tons of features to suit similar styles of David Lynch (what next? - is being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It is certainly not for every taste, but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb rating: 6.2 / 10.
