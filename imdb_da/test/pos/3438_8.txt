-It's Carla Gugino * Yay * and a Crappy Ending * Boo * <br /> - "Jaded" is a very erotic story of a beautiful woman coming in a city trying to escape her past. Whiles she meets two lesbians and after a few drinks the two decide to have fun. But one of the girls takes things a little too far and rapes her while the other girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach, where the incident happens the next day and is taken to hospital. Then we use the rest of the film and look at her attempts to bring down the two girls while learning something new about who she is and where she comes from and a little about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-author Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its low budget. The handheld and sometimes resembles 16mm, but it fits the movie, as the story requires a hard look at it. The actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there is nothing to complain about. The standout feature in the film is of course Carla Gugino, who carries everything in this movie. She is actually more nude in this movie than she is in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is really quite pointless, but he is fun to watch. I don't really have much attention to the music, as it doesn't really draw attention to itself, but it gets the job done with what it has. The movie is R-rated, and that is for a very good reason. It is very sexual and very graphic at times. It is essentially border on soft core at times, but the sex scenes are needed for the movie, so it doesn't feel like it's just there to be there. Although there is a pointless scene where we see Chris McDonald getting it on, that scene was a bit pointless, but it's not really a problem I guess. The only flaw in the movie is that we don't see the trial after all we go through in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something. It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since this. This is a very gifted woman can do good things with a very small budget. I really hope she'll be back in the game soon because she's a great instructor. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema. Instead, it's an enjoyable movie that shows a fantastic instructor. Think you see porn whiles watching this movie.
