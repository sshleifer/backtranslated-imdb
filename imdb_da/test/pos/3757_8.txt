I absolutely love this movie and have seen it many times. I lost it in around 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four, but my tape is hard-worn now and I will love a new copy of it. I have sent Film Four to email to ask them to show it again, as it has never been available on video and, as far as I know, has not been repeated since the 80s. I have not answered, and it has still not been repeated. The performances are amazing. The movie has it all. It's fun, sad, disturbing, exciting and takes you back to school days. It is extremely good paced and grabbed you from start to finish. The stage in the shower is extremely awful. I also can't hear the song Badge by Cream and don't think about this movie. This movie deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is amazing. Channel Fire please show again or drop Video or DVD.
