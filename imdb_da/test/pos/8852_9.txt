John Carpenter's brilliantly exciting flick is a great fusion of sci-fi and horror, by adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it extreme. A remake of Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter holds Cold War themes of paranoia and confidence as a backdrop for alien takeover and impending death in madness and isolation of the Antarctic setting. The carpenter's direction is always excellent, as his camera slides through the lonely world of the characters whose habitable environment is being destroyed by the original fear of taking over the body. But here and much like David Cronenberg's work, Carpenter does not hold back on the incident, as through some amazing special effects we witness some crazy moments of surreal gore. But he never loses touch with the human side of history, which, in the face of everything that shocks us, we are left with perceived beliefs about trust and suspicion. 9.10
