It's pretty good, all things considered. A must for anyone confused about the opposite sex (ie all of us!). The trailer does not give any reason for good reason. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously. It's like someone from the BBC's Children's Department decided to make a movie for adults. It's not a bad thing, IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
