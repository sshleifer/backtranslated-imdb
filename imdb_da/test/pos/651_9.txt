I remember watching this movie again and again when I was a kid. I loved it. Although I haven't seen it recently, I'm sure I would enjoy it just the same today. It's a very easy fun movie guaranteed to make someone laugh. The situation for each of the characters was so fun and imaginative! I especially liked the one with the girl who travels with her mother's ashes (which ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion), the robbers and the nuns. This lovely humor style is very much missed these days. This film also showed that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of our Lives) was in a good start. I recommend it to anyone who is lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
