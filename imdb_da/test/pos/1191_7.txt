I have avoided watching this movie for some time, but eventually retrieved a copy. Having been born late to see 'Hair' in its present-day surroundings, I have just been known for the British and Broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s, when it looked a little squeaky, but still fun. <br /> <br /> The movie. It drops some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). But what's left is very well presented. All singers and dancers are excellent and the most important artists (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. <br /> <br /> As a hippy party and anthem, Hair 'manages to remain potent even in a movie made ten years late. It was no longer the era of peace, love, and Biba, but the time of punk rock ... even if you look at this movie now, in the time of Iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the Vietnam problems of the 1960s. <Br /> <br /> Milos Forman, who also made 'Amadeus', did a good job of leading. In its reach and sensation, it reminds me of Norman Jewison's 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially with the joy of the 'Aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'Easy To Be Hard'. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.
