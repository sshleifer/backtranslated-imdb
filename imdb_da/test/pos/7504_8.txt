Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Starring George C Scott, this redefines the phrase "tear a new $ $$ hole." In this case, the goal is America's Medicare and grand hospital system. The whole hospital is patients and doctors dying because their names and prescriptions change. Scott roars, screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. His comment on Dachau to one of his many bosses is sure to evoke laughter. He beats and raps himself a hippie 3 times. This is one that has to be seen and heard, since the monologues and soliloquies are the key points of the film.
