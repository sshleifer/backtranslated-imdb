This movie is a gem ... an undiscovered Gerry Anderson classic. The origin of both "UFO" and "Space 1999" is evident from this film, including the cast list, which includes the late ed Bishop and George Sewell, both of whom went on "UFO". <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many television successes, did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think of what he could have done with the movie version of "Thunderbirds" (which he rightly proclaimed from!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure if you give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleranger" a fair chance you will appreciate it are good qualities.
