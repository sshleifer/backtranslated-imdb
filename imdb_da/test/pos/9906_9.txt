This wonderful witty comedy drama awakened the audience at the Philadelphia Film Festival and whipped them to wild applause after its conclusion. Struggled by accomplished performances with a nuanced cast, robust performance by director Jeff Hare, a tremendous pace and one of Peter Falk's best performances this year, the film stands out as a loving greeting to the family's heights and inconveniences. <br /> <br /> Falk stands out as Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum, a wildly eccentric Shakespeare thespian who decides to end his life but not before rounding off his three adult children and throwing a "big fat Jewish suicide party". The movie pieces with indelible delights. There is Morris's "tushy room"; Laura San Giacomo's passionate rendition of Morris's cynical daughter; quick-fire comedy dialogue reminiscent of Neil Simon and Woody Allen's work; David Paymer's crooked timing, which plays Morris sorely wounded psychotherapist son; and Morris patented egg creams (but beware of drinking them too quickly will cause an unpleasant brain freeze). It's all shrouded in a sensitive, intimate New York atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare turns out to be a master craftsman who draws memorable performances from his cast and lends the film a joyous humanity. I was fortunate to see a previous movie by Hare: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man" with Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a Los Angeles man sprouting in madness. Visceral grit of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" is a testament to Hare's eclecticism and extensive talent. I look forward to checking out his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard "Checking Out" missing a distributor at this time. Some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem, because it is a potential cash register titan in the way of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Most noble, it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joy of this movie.
