I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see the movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part certainly worked ... really good indeed. But the film was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a big action. The mystery is pretty hard to figure out, and Rose [McGowan] does something "Oscar-worthy" acting towards the end of the movie, but I don't want to give anything away. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also good in the movie along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries or action movies or just like Rose ... I totally think you would like this movie.
