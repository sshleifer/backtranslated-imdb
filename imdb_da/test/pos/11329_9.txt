For those who like their movies full of exploding planets and extreme violence, it's certainly not one to see. In fact, there is very little plot at all (or at least very small that cannot be summed up in a few seconds: A meets B. Mr A falls for Mrs B and has an affair with her. A and B then fall in love and wonder (largely) about having an affair themselves). This is Cantonese Visconti. History There is none, but what you get is a series of wonderful images and weakly trivial music that conveys the slow passage of the central character's feelings. There is also a chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a range of beautiful, elegant clothes. For my money it's worth seeing alone. How could this woman ever be an action heroine? She looks as if she has pulled straight out of Vogue's sides.
