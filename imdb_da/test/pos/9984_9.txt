I was blown away by this movie. I am one of those people who just take a risk with movies that do not particularly appeal to me sometimes and I have to say that this paid off. I mean, Wow! Even my young boys enjoy the movie (5 and 6 at the time), although I'm quite sure this wasn't aimed at their age groups. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is a great plus. It's so great to sit down in a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity, violence (except a very short scene) or anything else you'd likely find moral objection. <br /> <br /> This movie brought you together on a journey you're so ready to believe because of the great play. You feel the great variety of emotions depicted with the characters. I never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat, but I couldn't help being intensely interested in how it would show up. I have nothing to compare it to when I haven't seen golf in reality or on movies before, but everyone did a good job keeping the pace and emotions captivating here. The score also made wonders; excellent, excellent score. Even if you don't think it would be your kind of movie, watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I was determined.
