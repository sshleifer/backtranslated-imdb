The subspecies series is a will always be the best vampire movie ever. There is something about those that make them special, I think it is the feeling you get when you see them. <br /> <br /> They are set in modern times, and yet they feel as if they were set in the 1700s or 1800s that it has some things to do with the set used so if it works, keep it up to the guy :). In a quick round of what happened in the first part - Radu was apparently the banner from his home many years ago by his father, and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birthright. The bloodstone and his whole father have it, so he kills his father, played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm films). and taking the blood stone, which has the power of anyone who ever has it, because whoever has it, never needs to stifle anyone again, because the stone is supposed to have to kill the bloody blood of the holy blood and every time Radu takes a drop from it he slowly goes crazy. (That's all we need for a crazy vampire as if a normal vampire isn't bad enough). well Radu`s brother Stephan tries to stop his evil ways all the while trying to stop falling into a tourist living in a house / fort belonging to a friend of his. <br /> <br /> Well one thing leads to another and the two brothers collide and well you'll have to watch the movie to see what's going on from here. I will review / comment on the other successors soon. <br /> <br /> The difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial, and that's not how it will appeal to everyone, but it has an atmosphere far better than buffy, although Radu doesn't look as good as the wonderful full Sarah Michelle Gellar :). rating for this movie 10/10 a good example of how to perform a vampire movie :). <br /> <br />
