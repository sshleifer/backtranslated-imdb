I would like to say that I absolutely loved the Campfire Tales! For me it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted end. As if the contents of the film were not scary or weird enough, you have the end. It's a great movie, and I'm so happy it will be released on DVD on August 30th. I would not hesitate to get my copy on that day. I don't think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have because all those other movies came out shortly and were recognized, but if it wasn't for my brother telling me the movie, I wouldn't have known . Which stinks, because in my opinion it is far better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer" or any other horror of that time. So I hope you can see the movie yourself and at least see the difference. I loved it and being a horror movie junkie, Campfire Tales was like dessert for me!
