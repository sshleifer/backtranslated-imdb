Korean "romance" about the owner of a camera store diagnosed with a fatal disease. As he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end, he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer. A friendship and romance grows in the morning, even though neither expresses any kind of love to the other. Good movie is, unlike anything you will probably see remade in America, simply because the studios would insist that the "couple" is about their feelings. He won't say anything because he doesn't have that long to live, she doesn't want to because it's not what is done, and he doesn't answer as she thinks he should. Of course, it's much more complex than I do it to be and in honesty are the kinds of things you should discover for yourself. Is it a good movie? No, but it is a good one that will move you emotionally. The film's final lines still hang me: "I always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you will remain in my heart as you are at the last minute. Thank you and goodbye". It may seem strange from the context, but in the film it is very moving.
