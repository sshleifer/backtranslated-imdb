Like most people, I was interested in "More" exclusively because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which has proved to be the only Pink Floyd album that I still listen to after all these years. It was a surprise to run the movie in a local video store in a digital remastered version. It was an even greater surprise to find out that it is a pretty good movie. Visually, it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of the soundtrack music, which I can only tell by Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a pleasure to watch the movie with my copy of the album next to me and mentally check out each track as it was used in the movie. Dave Gilmour's card "A Spanish Piece" was the only one I didn't hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver." The last track is boring on the audio track album, but works very well under the movie's title order and revives at least once later. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind. <br /> <br /> The reason for "More" is a bit difficult to take at times, especially at the beginning, when the movie seems to be just a vehicle to demonstrate the obedience of those involved in doing so . But in the end, the film shows that it has much more to offer than the plot, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does any of them take heroin, fully know the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to respond directly to the question, but Stephen's use of heroin seems to be a logical extension of his lonely pursuit of pure pleasure. I highly recommend this movie to any Pink Floyd fan who appreciates the highly underrated "More" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in the 60s counter-culture and how it was portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is, as I am too young to have experienced the 60's firsthand, but it seems to capture the spirit of times in a way no other movie does.
