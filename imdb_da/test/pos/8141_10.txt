My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was amazing! It's a movie noir with great plays, amazing script, cool music, it was all very well done and entertaining. Don't know if it will be a release in theaters, but it would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love, low budget but great on style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts that she has in this, she is amazing.
