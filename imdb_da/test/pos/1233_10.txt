hi all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I couldn't agree with you! This show was so cool and sweet, I saw it as a child in the late 80's. Amongst Denver are also other favorites, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite comic from the 80s. It brings all the memories back. The theme of the tune was also great, I get goosebumps when I hear it. It is boring that it lasted so shortly, but it has remained a firm favorite. It is good that I am not alone and that there are people out there who also liked it. This is one of the cartoon shows I have to hold for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
