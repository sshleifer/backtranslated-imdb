This version of "The Lost Horizon" is actually not a bad movie at all. I think the problem is people like choosing musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I watched the movie on its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music in particular. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the play is good, and it is technically excellent. Well, there are one or two pretty stupid dance tracks, but hey, you can't win them all. I have this movie on video and watch it so often ... and I enjoy it every single time!
