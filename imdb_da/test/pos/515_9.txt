Now here's a movie that does something that hasn't happened for a long time. It takes ten or as different elements as we are already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-of-the-line special effects, etc.), and makes it something that feels brand new. In what could easily have been just a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer", Wesley Snipes (none of my favorites since and mostly because of "Passenger 57") gives a really good lucky as the half human / half blood sugar. He acknowledges the internal conflict, but no longer stays with it. He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman. <br /> <br /> I would say that the only part of the movie that got me a bit miffed was the ever-present horror movie cliche of the one hero who knows who knows Exactly how to stop the evil guy. On the other hand, you must have it in a movie like this, so it is easily excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes are good. And Steven Dorff, hyped in the previews, makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes' hero. He has class, presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino to tone it down. Who would ever think a comic film would be an actor launch pad? I sincerely hope this. And whoa! where the hell did Kris Kristofferson play acting talent? Don't make me wrong, but the productive actor hasn't done anything memorable since the "Millennium" and how many of us just saw it from the cool video box? Well, here he is, people, in a very obi-wanish trip, like Blade's mentor and grandfather. And good job too. <br /> <br /> The quality of the play is matched by the quality of choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a vibrant techno battle, the battle scenes bring back and quickly ban memories from Mortal Kombat. Hi! It also had a script! I wondered what had happened to all the good writers out there. <br /> <br /> The two big signs to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no sense of regret about paying full price to enter, one let any Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon." (Wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) I also look forward to the inevitable successor, as per. the film's end. Let's just hope they do such a good job with the first. <br /> <br />
