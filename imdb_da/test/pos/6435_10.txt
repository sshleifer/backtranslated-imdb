OKAY. Who ever invented this movie hates humanity and wants to see them all split their throats. This "movie" was absolutely and completely rubbish. What were the strange old bags? She was seriously on some sort of horrible substance, and could she just think she could control people? She ran around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what? Do I have a boogger hanging out of my nose? What are you staring at? Are you like sea witch or something? Everything and everything though I thought the graphic was top notch old chap. For that alone I would give it a ten. But just cover your ears when you see it. The pure and complete evil that comes from that movie will make your ears soft and your eyelids fall off. Who knows? You can even get a knot in the small intestine. You are better aware of fools.
