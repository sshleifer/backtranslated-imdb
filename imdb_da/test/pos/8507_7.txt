I've seen 'NSNA' just after I watch all of Roger Moore's movies, and I have to say it was so good to see Connery again. He proves for all time that he is the only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not really a masterpiece, but it is really worth seeing. The jokes are much better here, the effects are fun and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is just wasted, and the score is not often good, and there are a few scenes that seem quite unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 2.5+ 4+ (1+ - 6)
