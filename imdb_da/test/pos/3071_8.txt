I first saw Robin Hood: Lord of Tights back in 1994 at the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was fun. After I watched the movie, I have to say it was even better than I thought. It's not just that much fun, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by Hummie Mann. The action in the movie is also good, Cary Elwes is fun as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks themselves are fun. But the best part of the movie is played by Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("King illegal forest for pigs will kill in it's one", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest"). He somehow mixes up all the words and speaks a sentence that no one understands. Robin Hood: Men in tights are in my book one of the best Mel Brooks movies to date, and I can't say that I have so much laugh about a movie like this. It's just non-stop laughing.
