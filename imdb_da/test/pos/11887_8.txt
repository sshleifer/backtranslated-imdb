This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Much of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a rather subtle, sometimes (in other times just in your face) contrast between old and new China. For example, Kara Hui called a country bumpkin and comes into trouble when trying to adapt to the new, but eventually to save her families honor dress as an old-fashioned heroine as opposed to modern military style Hsiao Ho. Gordon Liu seems to have played his role in laughing, playing his serious monk persona with stupid wigs and a guitar. The final match is simply amazing and ends in a defeat for Johnny Wang over death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great game with a bully with 'invincible armor' - simply amazing. And Kara Hui does some amazing actors and battles. A good movie.
