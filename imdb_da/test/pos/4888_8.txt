Whether you are a fan of the series that inspired it or not, there is no denial, it's a scary job. But in the best possible sense. Keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms, which made an unpleasant transition to the big screen, Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss have gone down another way and solve the problems of managing their success along with adding other creations and, inevitably rehashing some of their best loved characters. It is a pity that they did not stick to a more consistent League of Gents movie because it is as inventive as including oneself in the manuscript, it weakens the finished film. Worth renting though.
