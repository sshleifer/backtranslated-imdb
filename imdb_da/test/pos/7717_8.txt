How accurate do homosexuals do in a culture that generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims, there is no hope of living a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close families. This is the most important point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably named for the western spicy dish that involves tender pieces of young chicken meat! Jimmy is a typical young Asian breeder in Britain of traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views of marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inevitable, though apparently he is completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows the truth must be told, but fears the consequences of it, especially as his father seems to be terminally ill. And then he becomes intricate in a fraud that becomes wider and wider when the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or condescending to any group portrayed. The action is generally excellent, although it may seem a little ham in places, as the instructor tends to look for humor rather than letting it bloom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or scripts, but the film is entirely made up of the wonderful mood that is ultimately expressed - a feeling that all fathers around the world would do well to learn.
