When I first watched this movie back in mid-January (2005), I didn't like it. I thought it was too strange and thought that some parts that the main star Judith Light acted were so odd. (That is of course true) And then I saw bits the next day when it re-aired, and I felt pretty much the same. Then I saw it again two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005) and I really started to enjoy it, and this time I lost the whole thing. I even cried the first two times, but first and foremost because the actress actually cried and I am a big fan of her. It is a very well done and finished TV movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I watch it over and over again. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my type of movie, but I enjoy this! A +++
