Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making movies both popular and critical; But this little movie was where he started. And it certainly showed his talent, with his striking black-and-white filmography and achronological storytelling, which prefers his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and crisp right up to the end of the end, whose taste was expected, but whose tip is unexpectedly delicious. The action, on the other hand, is not entirely in the same class - the film has a stylized quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intends. But it is still a nice debut, at the same time claustrophobic and insulting.
