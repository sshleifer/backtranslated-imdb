Like all the very earliest films, this "movie" is very, very short-lived - approx. a minute! So because of its shortness, it is not really possible to compare it with more modern films. But for its time, it is actually a very remarkable movie. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted - making Annabelle red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I have actually seen two different versions - one where she is red and another where she changes color all the way through. I think the red depicted on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and resembles a piece of amazing performance art. And unlike other one minute (or less) movies of the day, this one I could see repeatedly - it's just the visually convincing and strange. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch it online, there is a 36 second version on Google Video (write in "serpentine dance").
