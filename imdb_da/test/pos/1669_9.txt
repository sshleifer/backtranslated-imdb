A recent re-release of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes') with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the United States in a beautiful new print from The Criterion Collection with enhanced subtitles and some extra features. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was blacklisted. Rififi was well published in the US and did well in art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the United States for "Never on Sunday" (1960) with his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popular for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', who was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a new interview with Dassin. I didn't understand before that one of the greatest robbers, Cesar Milanese, was played by Dassin, who stepped in as the original actor became inaccessible. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian safe cracker who does not speak French. Although this classic has all the steps of French film noir - the black and white twilight world of well-lit occasions, shiny black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, including a dramatic and lit title song performed at the club, stony faces and Gauloises in hand or mouth - I don't think it's so atmospheric or just as distinctive a style as Melville's film does. But there is the fascinating robbery that still stops today as a tour de force. It goes like clockwork, with a nice sense of craftsmanship and cooperation between the robbers. Some nosy police are handled effectively. Things go wrong quickly when they go home and distribute the ticket when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a lady a ring with a million dollar bracelet in it. Has there ever been a heist movie whose perps lived happily ever? <br /> <br /> It is the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and Dassin, an American director who had an exceptionally varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for it. He took a novel so conventional that he would reject it and add some key elements that make it special. In that case he could not continue the adjustment: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the protagonist Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His ugly face is perfect for the role. He later played the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), who used French actors in Greece for a political story. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 movie film (it falls in relation to 'Rififi'), which also has American distribution. It has a good attitude, but it is wasted, everything has been bland and bright and prettier. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, "Never Sunday" with his captivating theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won the Best Film in Cannes 1960); 'He Who Will Die' The Political Choice 'Rififi' Genre Choice. A strange piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough Hollywood genre work would avoid these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947), a policeman, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949) and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally, I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material - hence my lasting fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in not only making Hollywood noir, but then on to Paris and producing a memorable example of its fifty-five French derivative.
