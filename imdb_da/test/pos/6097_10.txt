This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is about true love and friendship. About turning your life and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen can play the same role he has done in so many other films, but recently we have seen him in other roles, which he also does well. But then what if he plays the same role he has done in other movies? He is perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen also does a good job. These two criminal "low-lifes" are the best friends ever. They share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the cost is. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything on hold (things you can't put into play unless you have to do even more criminal acts) and take her to a better place. They do the best they can ?? These two men are not masterminds, but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are my greatest heroes too ??
