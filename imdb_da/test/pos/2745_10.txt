Every Saturday morning at. 11, I saw superstars. All the major events happened on this show at that time. The challenge that aired Sunday morning was also decent, but all the great things happened on this show. Wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or speak on their own to the screen in front of a background that promotes them. The matches were usually squashes, but sometimes you would see 2 mid-carders square off in the main event. There were also interviews that usually resulted in violence and thus set a feud up. These segments range from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I don't remember titles that change hands on this show. It usually happened at pay per views and Saturday Nights Main Event.
