I walked through my local library, searched VHS tapes when I saw a movie that made my mouth drop - Waterbabies. I've been hoping to watch this movie again - it's been over 22 years since I saw it (cable movie channel about 78-79). I had recalled many good details - especially Grimes. My son, who is 4, and I saw it. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "not nice" and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love Tom. He accepted it. It was great that I still recalled some of the songs too! They were stuck in their heads for 22 years - which means they should have something memorable, eh? <br /> <br /> It's a good kid's movie with parental guidance in case of questions about what kids might go through it wasn't nobility / society in the timeframe. This is what every child faces every day (except for a few lucky ones), and while we try to make Disney coat films and make them more PC for kids these days, that doesn't mean cruelty didn't exist - or even still not . I enjoyed the animation. It wasn't Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched a brush on this movie. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on. David T plays two roles! (I really like him!) James M does too. The water lakes themselves are cute. You're sorry Tom and the root of him. Then Billie is extraordinary in the multi-rolling part she plays - it's as if her eyes are magical! I am a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW, and company (AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HP!), And I filed this with those kind of movies. Yes, he jumps into the water, but not because of suicide. He ran because he trusted the lady in black - she had been around all the time. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, get a rental profile. If you happen to find a buy-able copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
