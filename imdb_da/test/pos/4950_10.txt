Not too much top is the classic "top gun" or "independence day" when it comes to fighters excitement. Yes, the film at the top of the bottom is based on a really fictitious example of how someone can pull a rescue, but it's cool because it breaks all the traditional rules. The child does what he wants to do in a jet that he wants to do. <br /> <br /> I can't really put my finger on what I love about this movie, but others I know make that movie feel the same about what I do. I think it's just about much fun, but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy into. Again, no matter what I loved, people I know saw it, so loved it is definitely worth looking to make your own decisions about it. Put it this way, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and I like this movie as much if not more than Top Gun. Don't miss out, see it, a truly inspirational movie.
