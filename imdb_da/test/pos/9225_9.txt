RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR STEALER are, in my opinion, an excellent masterpiece. I felt warm and homely when Rainbow Brite (Bettina's voice) and Krys (David Mendenhall's voice) sat down to avenge the princess (Rhonad Aldrich's voice). If you ask me, the princess was completely bitchy and devilish. For me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. But I liked her slot as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought Lurky (Voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (Peter Cullen) were devilish. Before I unpack it, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly thrown, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it, especially the hardcore TV series fans. I guarantee you enjoy it.
