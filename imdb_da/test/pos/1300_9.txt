Let's see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible clich√©, as Korean romance dramas and movies go. First of all, there are a couple of much lost siblings, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not so popular girl and two beautiful, popular guys who fall and fight over her. Third, one of the signs suffers from a tragic disease that ultimately takes its life. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the real actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit perfectly with the role, the movie is exciting - I honestly couldn't stop seeing. Kang Dong Won, despite his beautiful face, gives a fantastic heart performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, as well as all the supporting actors. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
