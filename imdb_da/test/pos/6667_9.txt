I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had read the book good ten years ago and was fascinated by how it would translate into movies. The play is very true to the book, which I was charmed by - it is a rarity in itself these days. The characteristics were solid and credible, and the stroke counting kept me changing in my perceptions, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> An intelligent and well-developed film.
