An excellent story told by the film producer. The interaction between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers' mind about just who was human. Man for no reason killed the animals for survival. At the end of the movie, you were left over and wondered who the real "hero" of the movie was. A good story told. The human actor did an excellent job, but the leopard stole every scene it was in.
