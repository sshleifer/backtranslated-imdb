"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing movies in 1986, and in a year that saw "Blue Velvet", you know what's saying something. Seen today its lost a bit of its power and remains much better than the overstated "Kids". The previews of "Kids" played it up to being exposed to the deterioration of the nation's youth. In fact, it was slightly more than an exploitation film based mainly on shock value. "River's Edge" was promoted as a teenage exploitation flick but was actually much better. The only time it goes from worrying to uncomfortable is the constant image of the dead naked body. Besides that, the film is thought-provoking and for all its minor mistakes it is quite realistic. Keanu Reeves, known for being a special tree artist, offers his best performance as a burnt-out teenager. Ione Skye is just as likeable and sympathetic. Dennis Hopper (on the comeback trail with this, "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") gives a superb performance as the eerie but pathetic hippie generation superior. Crispin Glover, while always entertaining to see, seems a little out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group. The best performance is certainly Daniel Roebuck. Like the killer John, Roebuck is scary numb. It's a pity he didn't become a bigger star as a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing and bold. Don't misunderstand this for another lame John Hughes clich√©d high school flick as "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this movie are advised to check out a 1981 Canadian movie called "Out of the Blue" directed by Dennis Hopper. Its second shockingly gloomy study of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have influenced "River's Edge". (7/10)
