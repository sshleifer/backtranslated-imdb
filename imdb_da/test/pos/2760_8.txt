Graphically, the same game as the first level is different and some new features are added to the fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (the Xbox finally came with a fifth with 2x), it had a clearer resolution, and the treasures looked better and more detailed as PS1 and N64 could handle . <br /> <br /> The levels are really incredibly finished, right from the start to the end, as the first, the school was my favorite, I enjoyed that level so much, not just for the golf cart, which would sometimes drive you over but for the length. That's what I liked about the first two games, they don't make these games graphically improved, they just focused on the length of levels, which is cool. All in all, as good as the first, and worth playing.
