Great movie in a Trainspotting style ... To be billed as the Welsh Trainspotting, but then it was Twin Town, even though it's streets in front. <br /> <br /> Take a weekend in Cardiff Clubbers life, good debut movie from Kerrigan and some great cast cast performances. <br /> <br /> Go see! then go clubbing
