After reading some of the previously unpleasant remarks I had to put my two cents. This show was not, despite what the goon in Essex thinks, the worst ever broadcast on television. I think most of today's TVs are much worse (when is this stupid "reality" fad ever ending?) And there's no current show I can stand to see. Gimme the things I grew up with. I'm a 1965 baby and I'm not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it originally aired, and I think it helped me to hang out in those miserable days. I was such a misfit back then, and "Fantasy Island" appealed to my imagination. When I was a budding writer these days, it provided incredible opportunities to practice the vessel. What a wonderful premise! I don't want to say it didn't have its faults. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could also be good and it was a blast to see and still is. As for the cheesiness factor, I find it unfair to label each 70's product as cheesy. There were many good things since then, and it was among the ranks. (BTW, most seasons aired in the 80s !!) My favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 for the most part. For those who depart Herv√© Villechaize for his heavy French accent and his short stature: Awake and learn something! It's so easy to make fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". That man made the best of what he was treated in life, and if you don't like it, it's just hard. Get some compassion. He has been dead for 15 years and how easy it is to cut down a person who cannot defend himself. There's just no more shame. <br /> <br /> I love this show. So it looks dated. Hate to tell you this, but we did not spray special effects and blu-ray discs. We were lucky to have video recorders. Live with it. Accept it for what it is and it's simply fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that was what it was for me - an escape from my rat's real life. And it's still very fun to watch.
