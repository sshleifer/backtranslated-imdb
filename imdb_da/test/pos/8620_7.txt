The accounts look right with a human factor added to the mix. A lot of sadness. I'm sure I wasn't him .... another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really beautiful accounts for the real women. But I do not think it was about the women, even though it was JFK Jr's passion. What a shame. any loss of life is a shame. <br /> <br /> Seemed like a good account of his life. I recommend it if you are in biographies and melodrama!
