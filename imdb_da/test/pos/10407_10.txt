This review includes some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- I just finished seeing my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was good! This may sound cheesy, but several times during the movie I forgot it wasn't really XD action is convincing, though the play by Masafumi Kobayashi (playing himself, I think ...) sometimes seems a little hokey. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu's Rinne) seemed to change the level of credibility throughout the movie: sometimes she is really good, so in the next moment she is really cheesy (especially at the end of exorcism and subsequent re-possession. <br /> A character that was ridiculous at first was Mr. Hori, a man covered by tinfoil believing "ectoplasmic worms" coming to eat everyone. He gives unintentional comic relief at first (appears as the stereotypical alien kidnapping type victim But near the End has some really scary scenes, the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything was tied in. There are some things that aren't really explained (like a lot of suicide in a Tokyo park and where it reincarnated Kagutaba boy came from) but everything else turned out fine.The end has been to be one of the most unpleasant, if not the scary sequences I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. <br /> <br /> All in everything is Noroi a lot of fu A way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD gives great picture and sound (most importantly the English SUBTITLES-Engrish free!) for a great J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking it up.
