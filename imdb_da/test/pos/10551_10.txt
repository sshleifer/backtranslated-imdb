This is one of my favorite movies EVER ... I've seen it in a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to see it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to check out the resort where it was recorded on my upcoming vacation ... by anyone, the name of it? If so, please email me !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released, and I was about Nikki's age, and I long ago bugged my dad to take me away somewhere because of course I expected the same thing to happen to me! It's just such a fantastic setting and such a sweet puppy love story. This is a particular DVD collector's must!
