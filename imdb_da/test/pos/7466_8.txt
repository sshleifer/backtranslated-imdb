I had the honor of tonight watching a screening of the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Go into the movie, I knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the movie's plot was interesting. So when I entered the theater a few hours ago, I wondered what the final judgment would be thumbs or thumbs down. <br /> <br /> "These girls" are the story of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the lead character who basically does not know what to do with her life after High School, but her father is pushing her to college, which is something she will not do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) goes after a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh) is planning to spend her summer childhood. But this summer it will be especially because all the challenges Keith Clark (David Boreanaz) is the sexy older hunk that they babies to. Fun times and many laughs ensue ?? <br /> <br /> I usually don't like movies like "These Girls" but there is something about this movie that I really liked. I think the quality I liked most was that it seemed quite realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a hunky guy who lets them all have sex only to be harassed by them later. It's a pretty funny story of growing up, friendship and sex, but even though it sounds rather cheesy, I can see the majority of this movie going on in reality. The subject here is probably one of the main reasons why this film did not get a mainstream release in the US. All girls in this movie are supposed to be under the age of 18, as if I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the United States, although minor sex appears daily, many production or finance companies will not fund a movie like this because of sexual content This information was actually confirmed by the director himself John Hazlett at Q&A after the movie. What causes me is that the sex scenes in this movie are not graphic and nudity is less. Not to mention that all the actresses in this movie are well over 18 in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the movie does best is that it gives a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a "every now and then" characteristic for them. The jokes were funny because they were wisely written not because they were dirty or over the top. Everything seemed to flow together nicely both comedy and drama. Scripture was very strong. <br /> <br /> The play was very good for the most part. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated TV shows of all time "Wonderfalls" was just amazing; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, both of whom did a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and he looked as though he was having fun while shooting most scenes. The guy played a ball head so it was fun to see him play that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight, who seemed to be a very nice guy and was very grateful for the comments on movies. I'm shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. I think with a little marketing behind it, it could have taken off. Unfortunately, it will be one of those directly to DVD movies that so few will ever have the pleasure to see. I think with that little budget, Mr. Hazlett had to work with. The movie turned out well, and I think he did a good job of leading this little gem. <br /> <br /> For someone who typically hates teen sex comedies, I can honestly say I really enjoyed this movie. The character development and the kvidscriptet made me sit there for an hour and a half and be entertained. This is a nice comedy because it has heart and spunk to it. I know I want to be sure to buy this movie when it comes to DVD on May 16, 2006. If you are a fan of upcoming age stories, you should watch teenage or romantic comedies to check out this movie because it is a of the funniest movies of its kind released this year. MovieManMenzel's final score for "These Girls" is an 8/10.
