I don't expect much when I decided to watch this movie so I was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it. A few scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. The characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. The fun of it comes from watching Crawl (Shore's character), a ditzy-yet-clever California guy, a country college girl bringing home for Thanksgiving, trying in her awkward (yet endearing) way to fit into their lifestyle. I was also surprised that in all this was a message. If you have a chance, watch this movie!
