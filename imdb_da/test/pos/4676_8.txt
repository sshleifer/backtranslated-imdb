One of the benefits of my job is that when things go slow, I can watch the movie in our downstairs theater (I work in a small 2-screen theater) in the cry room and still watch the concession stand. I've seen Italian jobs probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, although the play is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is ok, Charlize Theron appeals to the boys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a good job of playing a dirtbag, though many people disagree. I also enjoyed Mos Def as an explosive expert who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever I can!
