Believe me when I say this show is simply fun. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, traveling from city to city, taking part-time jobs, chasing women and learning everything he can about life. Kintaro should be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to extreme and it's just laughing loudly fun every time. From his constant, endless quest to study life, to small things, he instantly blows into life or death. One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro constantly extremely over the top terms and reactions. He spends a great deal of time in various super-deformed modes such as Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less than 0.1 seconds, his face not only becomes serious, but manga-fighter-style life or death expression as a weightlifter tries to benchpress a new record. It is fun. <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, the writing is great and the English voice dealer might not be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will make you roll around when he doesn't even really say anything. The only thing to mention is, it is without a doubt an Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh at movies like American Pie, you'll love this. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
