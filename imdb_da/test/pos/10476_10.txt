This movie says all there is to say about religion - I wish it was necessary to look at all bigots and would be clothes. <br /> <br /> The story, which dates back to the centuries of Danish centuries, is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a stiff priest who opposed all their dreams of love and explored the world and its many beauty. They are now old and their life and beauty spent. Their new help - as they "learn" to cook - is Babette (played by the lovely Stephane Audran who adorned so many of her husband Claude Chabril's film). Life in the village is simple and the sharp direction reflects it. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she wants a chance to prepare a party - a true love work. The party's race and its Chief Guest reveal messages of love and spirituality, and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for the devotion Babette prepares for and the speech given by the General at the end. Possibly the best international film from the 1980s.
