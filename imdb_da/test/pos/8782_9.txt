Oh, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after the Fathers (1963) and SABOTEUR prove the point. Having admired most of this director's work for many years, I had managed to skip this, perhaps from the lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as leading players. Of course, I was acquainted with the Statue of Liberty climax from seeing it repeatedly in film retrospectives, but I mistakenly assumed the story leads up to it might not hold my interest. Was I wrong! The exciting plot gets cooking right out of the bat through a chance encounter between the bad guy Saboteur and the good guy wrongly accused protagonist and continues to zoom together through a series of additional chances and narrow escapes. Known Hitchcockian elements are all there: The innocent person is mistakenly accused of a crime; People are not what they seem to be; Dramatic or unlikely places that intensify the thrilling scene that is being played inside them (a grand piano, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero throws himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palace house, an upper floor in a skyscraper and finally the God of Liberty). Throughout, humor is provided by supportive players, generous dollops from early WW2 vintage social commentaries, moments of human warmth, where people suffer in themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow man get something in return ?? In short, there was always a basic humanity at the heart of Hitchcock, but grisly the stairs - a sensational cast of supportive players, mostly Otto Kruger as the most beautiful villain this side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include the male leader of Noel Coward's PRIVATE LIVES ?? and it says it all) and Weaselly Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger ?? No relationship with Otto ?? as a prominent community dowager involved in fifth column intrigue (her character foreshadows it by Claude Rain's mother in unfortunate). Priscilla Lane does a fine job with a difficult role. For most of her early stages, we cannot tell if she thinks the hero is innocent or guilty, and she always seems to change her mind and does not come to his side until late in the matter. You can't determine if her action is wrong or we should be kept in uncertainty, but the plot development is so quick, fun and wise that we really don't care what she thinks. <br /> Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. Twice is Lane character going to change in the quarter? once to refund his kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to call from a phone box. Why these scenes were deployed is anyone guessing, perhaps to make the movie seem more realistic and thus increase credibility and excitement? Or maybe to give the audience a moment to breathe? Some of the characters are over the top ?? the incredible truck driver, the impossibly friendly and confident blind man living alone in an immaculate maintained forest cabin, the politically-philosophical spitting "human skeleton," and other members of the circus caravan, hiding the protagonists from their persecutors.
