OK, I admit, I'm 40 and still throw a tear every time I see Johnny calling his robot at the end. <br /> <br /> "Robot, stop now! Don't, stop the attack ... Robot, what are you doing, robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot ... Robot thanks! Don't do it, you will die ... Robot ... Robot, please comeback! I need you here ?? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot ??? -Johnny Sokko, The Last of Emperor Guillotine <br /> Of all the Tokusatsu out there, Giant Robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there, I credit it with getting me all sci-fi and anime, when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> LIVE ON THE GR!
