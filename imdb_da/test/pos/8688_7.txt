For the most part, I only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the present time to the future or the past. This movie is pure escapism. The dance starts almost instantly, and Debra Paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress is simply not in film in my opinion. Her dance, while hungry, surpasses her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, which is available on DVD, where she played the temple dancer Seetha. One problem with the movie is the closed setting. There are few outdoor scenes shot and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used again and again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. Her secret dual identity is incredible with the beauty of this size. Debra even uses a saber and keeps 2 enemy soldiers in check on a staircase she can do everything. What works Debra Paget as a princess. With her beauty she would certainly be the center of attention everywhere at any time in history. This movie, when hopefully available on DVD, will be a must buy. All in all, taken with a little humor, I loved it. <br /> <br />
