If you are among the IMDB audiences that put High Fidelity in the top 200, this movie is probably not for you. This movie is like unhip as Steve Frears is self-conscious hip. Renee Zellweger is excellent as a hip urban magazine writer who returns to her suburban Bucks County second to look after Mother Streep (who is delivering yet another hall-of-fame performance). William Hurt is ideally cast and the innocent, faithless and selfish man. If this movie does not move you to cry and laugh, then you are much too hip to enjoy it.
