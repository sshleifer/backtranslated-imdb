I first played this around 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really good and loved it. The game is simple. In a player's state, you walk around like James Bond and complete missions in various places like an arctic wasteland or a city. My favorite was one with a tank. In two-player mode, you and a friend choose any character you want and go out with a fight. the area you are in, you will find ammunition and weapons to help. From small arms to rifles to lasers and even your fists work. Again with two modes of play, there are plenty of places to go and some to unlock. I find this game really fun, but also very exciting. Because you never really know where your opponent is, and it is surprising to see them behind a door where you go. <br /> <br /> This game will be **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very good! Take it once!
