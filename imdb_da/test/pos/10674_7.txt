"Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (a "Doppelganger") is an entertaining Sci-Fi Twilight Zone style from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (of the Invaders' TV show) and Ian Hendry's star as astronauts were sent on a flight to a planet sharing a precise trajectory on the ground, but on the opposite side of the sun; hence previously hidden from view. An urgent European spacecraft director (supervised by the late Patrick Wymark) gets the plane fast, and after rigorous training, the astronauts are good at walking. Thus, the best sequences of the movie, the launch, the flight and the landing begin on the 'other' ground. Dazzling rocket miniature work (by Derek Meddings) and a dreamlike, elegant spaceflight (reminiscent of the best moments of 2001: A Space Odyssey) are light highlights in the movie. The landing on "doppelganger" ground is both exciting and eerie. Then the Twilight Zone aspect of the movie changes; with a plot lifted almost all of the classic TZ episode, "The Parallel." On the other hand, the film is still solid sci-fi, with some exciting 'mirror world' things to chew on (back print and left-handed handles). Less successful are the scenes depicting a land from the mid-21st century; where all the men wear turtlenecks and nehru jackets and all women have mini skirts. Some of the relationships with women in the movie are also very "non-PCs" according to today's standards. And (in the most consistent mistake of most of the 20th century sci-fi), computers, phones and other hardware are all big, colorful and lumpy (straight out of Patrick McGoohan's "The Fanger"). No one suggested the digital microprocessor age! If you can accept these errors in foresight, the movie is very interesting, with Thinne's solid leadership skills as the disturbed astronaut. And with a fine 1960's / early '70s style nihilistic ending! For fans of retro sci-fi (like myself) it's a "journey" worth taking!
