For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something you should be in the mood for. I'm very happy I recorded this - my wife remembered it when she was young, but I had never seen it. The family wanted to see something that wasn't too serious before bedtime and it was chosen. <br /> <br /> Our daughter has seen many of the old films with us - always complaining at first, but most often we come around. She ignored it in the beginning and preferred to check her email, but she started enjoying herself - many times laughing loudly for zaniness. It's great to think you can have a fun night with a 55 year old. The mono-color introduction that blends into the full-color adventure. It's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with, including a little song and a little dance along with everything you expect Lou and Bud to deliver. <br /> <br /> Watch it with your kids and have a very fun night!
