Considering Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's not a good idea to look at his filmography, see his debut feature shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, made with a small budget, but with all the features that made him a master movie maker and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Although short, the movie is no less gripping with its enchanting plot that will let you guess because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this story, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative structure and characterization. As mentioned, we follow a writer, Wannabe Called Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who starts a usual obsession with the following random people, he fancy on the streets in a voyeuristic manner, which at first could be thought of as research before beginning to make his own rules and break them. <br /> <br /> He meets charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw), who turns out to be a robber with distinctive sensibilities and the modus operandi, and soon finds himself confused with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and come in and speculate on the livelihoods of their sacrifice, like the pursuit of a femme fatal blonde (Lucy Russell), a mob's minor who rejects his every advance. <br /> <br /> Stated in a non-linear way that brings scenes that don't fully fill up at the beginning, the movie brings up more views as you study how Nolan maintains the excitement and intrigue with you as the audience expect and want more that is properly delivered. There are enough phrases here that spin the film in a dizzying crescendo, where the loose ends begin to come together, and the story of the star begins to shine through. <br /> <br /> It is also amazing how, as the first feature shot on the cheap, something that is wise and sophisticated can be perceived from its own experience of intrusion, with Nolan involved at every stage of production , from writing to shooting, producing and managing, working on the project a year ago shots can only happen on weekends. I guess here is an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots that should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there. Now I will patiently wait for Christopher Nolan's start due later this year, whose trailer is already such a tease.
