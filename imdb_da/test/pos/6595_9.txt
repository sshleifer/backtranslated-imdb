Not only was this movie spectacular, but it took me back the memory track with its true life soundtrack. These were the things we said, and doing ... these were the songs we listened to ... all in the same time, in the same era, right down south of Alabama. I could not have been a skateboard set, but I was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the leading edge with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, so they were more brave than I ever hoped to be spinning on their surfboards on wheels, use Alva and Adam's tricks, and hope that maybe, perhaps for a brief moment, they would adopt the Zephyr style. It just goes to show how much we all were in these wonderful days. ~ KLJ
