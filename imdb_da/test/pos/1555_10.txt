Outstanding history, great plays, amazing production values ​​and a cool, action-packed card with a perfect twist at the end. What a good short film! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again), and I became even more impressed because subtle touches become apparent for the second time - for a short film this packs many clever layers in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not too weak in the heart, but it is very well done and quite impressive for a short film - for any movie actually. It's an interesting story told very well, and each scene moves the story, revealing good movie making instincts about making this movie. The movie looks great, and David Morse is also great, with a dynamic performance delivered in all scenes. Seeing his character attempts to defeat the curve balls, life is throwing him, gives a fantastic experience. It should also be noted that when war torture is in the headlines every day, the lines between reality, good and evil can be very gray, while the rhetoric becomes loud and tries to make things black and white. AWOL gives wise audiences the opportunity to decide for themselves what they think the message is, what is genuine and what is not, which adds to the mystery. Both times I've seen it, the audience was WAY more in this movie than the others are playing with it, which says a lot. There are many shorts out there right now, but few deliver this kind of all-excellence and complex issues that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It sounds to me as the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker, or has a personal agenda because this really is a good example of short independent filmmaking. I see a lot of short films, and I have to say if only ALL the shorts that made the festival rounds were so good, then the shorts industry would have some serious legs.
