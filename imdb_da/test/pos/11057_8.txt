This is the 40-minute movie that introduces us to the butcher's character, which will later be explored more thoroughly in the Seul Contre Tous feature. In this film, the early period of his life follows from 1965-1979, but focuses on late seventies. The first pictures are of the slaughter of a horse, so the birth of a baby, the daughter of the butcher, which we quickly see grown up every year. The butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a man bitter with the world. He hates many things. His anger comes to mind when a man attacks his autistic daughter. The butcher hits the wrong man and finds himself in prison. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the slaughter's life right after his release from prison, then Seul Contre Tous takes from there. I saw the movies the wrong way, Seul Contre Tous first. Try to see this little movie first if you can.
