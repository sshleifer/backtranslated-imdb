No matter how much it makes me say this, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I was misled by the myriad of exaggerated reviews here on IMDb, but I expected so much more ... Of course, the idea is a good one, the violent scenes and the camera work is excellent, the imagination of genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" by a few mistakes that I find unforgivable. First of all, I am one of the few people who feel that the Heavy Metal music is playing in the most intense scenes, simply ripping the atmosphere apart ??? With another kind of music (Goblin ????) during the "needle scenes" it would have been SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys any chance of excitement ... Secondly, the final kitten scene and the one The last moments in the movie are simply stupid and uninspired. I don't want to say "amateur" because I love Argento's movie. The ending left me feeling empty. Talk about a final impression! It's hardly what happens in most of Dario's movies! Although, of course, Suspiria suffers from a hasty finale (though mostly brilliant) .... In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of its good points, but be prepared for some bad ones too. This is NOT a perfect movie in any way.
