I have just seen this lovely classic again after many years, the next to the last movie directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 (the same age where the film's male star Larry Harvey also died in 1973). Three future directors were in the crew: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (cinematographer) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story 'Goodbye to Berlin' by the well-known British author Christopher Isherwood, who was first transformed into a game by John van Druten, made for this film, and then converted into a musical "cabaret" and finally filmed as 'Cabaret', which brought the amazing Liza Minelli to world attention, with her voice that can crush a glass at a distance of one mile. Isherwood appears as a sign in the movie under his own name. He was gay, but in those days that were illegal and could land him in jail, he pampered his proclivities during the description of being what he calls "a confirmed bachelor". This is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, crazy, promiscuous, always cheerful and thoroughly unique character he calls Sally Bowles. Portrait of Sally Bowles in this movie is a turn-the-force of young Julie Harris, who sweeps all scenes into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm. Which vehicle for an actress with lots of charm of her own! It is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. Isherwood is played to perfection by young Lawrence Harvey, in a fine doomed performance that never allows the comedy to cross the edge, and even the moments of farce bordering on slapstick remain somehow 'almost credible'. Larry is so much fun portraying a wimpish hypochondriac. What irony, given the total lack of hypochondria shown by his courage and stoicism in the last year of his life, when he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. I knew him well in the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm and modest person. He admired his little girl Domino, now sadly also tragically dead. This film was his finest performance, followed by his spectacular work in 'Room at the Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Manchurian Candidate' (1962). Larry was often underestimated in his lifetime because he was too beautiful, was often cast as a cad, and glamor boys were not always accepted as good actors, but many of the finest actresses played against him, and they were undoubtedly about his abilities. and he was a strong leader in many of his most important times. If he had lived beyond the Middle Ages, he would have gone from strength to strength and become a "grand old man" on the screen. Sitting in his house in Hampstead one day he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a large barrel which he had brought from a foreign cellar. I said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? He replied proudly that it was a Sancerre whom he had chosen at the vineyard in France and was shipped specifically. He then added with extreme wistfulness: "You know I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is and you're the first to ever do it." What was important to him was to be recognized for taste in wine, and his more glamorous friends had denied him the satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring gives a touching early performance as a serious young man (later he had to play Nazi officers too much, poor guy), and young Shelley Winters play a rich German Jewish girl in her usual noisy but effective way, but It was not too difficult since she was still a noisy Jewish girl herself. This movie has such an air of joie de vivre that it is pure joy.
