I was not least familiar with the characters of the comic book series, but I expected this movie to just do the basics: introduce me to the characters and their intrinsic attributes, present a plot and end with the destruction of the greatest adversary and perhaps hints on the possibility of a successor. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic films, I felt that this did so with a little class. By risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic combat scenes, "Blade" presents a very modern, credible and gloomy world whose small nuances effectively succeeded in evoking a sense of fear - as less as it might have been - from a viewer who rarely get involved in a story unless it is an emotional aspect. It is, of course, that the film has countless plotholes and extremely unrealistic situations like a standard female doctor who is wise enough to compete what no one else has been capable of for thousands of years. But when you have an enemy as cool as that in this movie and are fighting scenes with engaging and exciting camera cuts and special effects like this, what else does it mean? It may take a little while, but for what it stands to do, "Blade" stands out in sharp relief among most other films in this genre.
