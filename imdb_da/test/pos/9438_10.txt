I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the film makers and it is sister film The Intruder (directed by the great unheard-of stylist writer Jopi Burnama) know only in their heart how much joy they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy northeastern town of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the opening frontline sequence, which manages to pull ever so little despite the fact that a man crashes through a window on a motorcycle, the relentless destruction of a silence lab is the introduction of one of The most simultaneously annoying and anemic bad in film history and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier would find ott and garish. Don't make mistakes; This is a truly unique experience. Early highlighting - an explosion (getting used to it, more where it came from!) Followed by a close-up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line-up of the word "father" in living memory. And then ... the theme song ... Yes, it deserves its own section. Sung by AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, it makes the songs written to the Rocky movies sound like Schubert. This is the all-time crap 80's heroic narcissism, with electoral texts like "the only thing I and you, it comes down to the lead" and much talk about having to "cross the line" (it will make sense in time - our hero cares a bit about the boundaries of bona fida police crew). Not to mention the Indonesian sovereigns fighting the title of the film seductively. At this point, anyone who wants to extinguish officially will not have a pulse. <br /> <br /> Our hero is Semitic policeman Peter Goldson (essayed brilliantly by Intruder star Peter O'Brien), the title "stabilizing". Man's bull in a china store approach to crime fighting and especially his less than unnoticed undercover work really leaves much to be desired, but he is undoubtedly an entertaining guide through the average streets of downtown Jakarta, with local sleaze ball connection captain Johnny in tow, and Peter's own waste of fashion partner in fashion crime Sylvia Nash, who does a little. So many highlights, so little time - "Happy" arrogance of Peter's not too convincingly claimed case against Chief Baddie Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White - helluva name eh? Well ...) , x marks the place place short stupidity, our hero takes terribly advantage of heroine Tina Probost in a moment of weakness on her behalf, the latter turning up on a stitch operation dressed as a member of a particularly flamboyant dance crowd. And believe me that almost doesn't cover it. <br /> <br /> There wasn't even time to go into the plot, which was about the pursuit of a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable national pride. Or our hero turns up at a funeral dressed as an extra on Boogie Nights. Or the completely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never weathered friendship shtick weather than these clowns. Trowel might be too subtle, I think. Ah it tails out of people and you never believed scenes of vicious devastation and general chaos could be so incredibly boring, but the interaction of character is overwhelming, the dialogue really priceless and incompetence somehow endearing. Oh and the shoes people - beware of the shoes!
