I didn't know what to expect when renting this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cool sequel, but I had also seen much of the director's later works, which although lovely gory was also rather incoherent. TORT NOT A DUCKLING actually had a linear story and a mystery that kept me guessing almost to the end. And after all, it was said and done, it was a truly disturbing and eerie experience. A big warning: I'd much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven duplicate found here.
