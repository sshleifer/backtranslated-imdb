This movie improved over time. I can't believe it's been forty years since I saw it at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie characters were not yet a reality, so any teenager could go into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a child, my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King have just been killed, but the following summer a man had to go to the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was Woodstock Nation's chance to hold it to the man. You will see where Robert Downey, Jr. got its sardonic shine. His old man was an instant hero for children like me. No blows are drawn in this classic, and aging hippies will rejoice when they revive this era. Hopefully, new flower children will be emboldened by it, and this present era of fascism will come under the same control as my era was exposed to.
