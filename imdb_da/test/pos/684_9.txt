"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of "Our Gang" talkie era. Hal Roach Studios now began to take their steps in making talking images, and "Shakespeare" is the happy result. The hallway is seen in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy Cop's wife. The kids don't find the game very fun to be in and are distracted by the people in the theater and can't remember their lines. Among the funniest bits is Kennedy Cop as the giant, who pulls his makeup out to battle with an over-the-earth man in a bull's-eye suit; and the dreadful dancing girl (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter.) <br /> <br /> Several feature films mention that "Shakespeare" has the first punch in a talkie. This can be true as they tried different speeds with the movie during the match. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is in the receiver of one of the pies. Very fun and an early gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10
