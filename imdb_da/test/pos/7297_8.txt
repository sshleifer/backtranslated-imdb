I just watched this movie for the first time after completing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the show is good - Lange is a star! - and that the movie is beautiful, but it has less than a '6'! I do not understand it. Come on! Scripture is not that bad! <br /> <br /> Having read many Pulitzer-winning novels, and having seen many of the films based on them, I think that a better than decent job of bringing manuscripts together. I thought the mating of the entire dialogue in the novel was accomplished almost perfectly. This story had a rather large amount of dialogue in it, and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER PART ** I was, however, a little disappointed in the Ginny-samples-to-kill-Rose subplot is omitted. I thought it was one of the more emotionally devastating parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it. Avid movie-goers, more than avid readers, I believe, tend to be less forgiving for protagonists who draw antagonistic things. It is suitable for confusing Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, you would like the movie. If you hated the book, you probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
