"Hunting Trilogy" by Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Spices (1952) and And! Rabbit! Spirit! (1953) should be considered the comical high-water mark of Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. Although they are rarely mentioned in lists of the "greatest" or "main" cartoons in the animation story, they are definitely the BEST comics I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors such as Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bro's cartoons, and these three especially some of the funniest ones ever made.
