"Closet Land" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political overtones, but there is so much more to this really moving story than that ... This is not just about the political excitement of the late 80s - It is about the personal persecution that a woman gets through as a child who was infected by a family friend. We see the subtle adherence to the parallels of a dishonest government / social structure and the culture of sexually transitory, where one in four young children is infected and one in three women has experienced some form of rape. me, it raises a cooling chicken-and-egg question: does the attitude of our sexual oppression-leading-to-predation create the political environment of fear and censorship, or does socio-political dysfunction bring about a culture of sexual astonishment? The psychological consequences of even asking this question force us to a place where we are brought to develop our own answers. <br /> <br /> Finally, our young lady writer (Stowe) has a similar moment to it at the end of Hensen's "maze" - she realizes in a glorious moment that the idea of ​​having her power stolen from her The secret police (Rickman) is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only fool you into giving it up, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that needs to be entered easily and you definitely do it. The minimalist aspects combined with the child-like animation touch the deepest parts of the psyche and leave no viewer unchanged.
