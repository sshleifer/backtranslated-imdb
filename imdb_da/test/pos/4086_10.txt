Television removes dozens of genuine crime movies every year. You can watch 3 or 4 every Saturday at Lifetime, and Court TV can be claimed for a couple each weekend. So I began to see The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent tale of a true family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that strung me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's challenging role. Georgia's look and feel was in almost every frame. If I had any complaint, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He just doesn't look or work like a small town southern lawyer named Byron Calhoun. He looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not really for this part. But this is a minor problem: Morrison Murders are worth seeing, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go out, you must lose it. You will not regret it.
