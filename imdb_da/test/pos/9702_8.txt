My sister, a friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We had all seen the first "Jackass" movie a while back and we all enjoyed it. We really looked forward to second. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From start to finish I played hysterically. It's equal parts shocking and fun, and it's certainly not for those with weak abdominal pain. It's obscene, but it's also groundbreaking American cinema ... well, maybe it's a little too much praise for a movie where men deliberately get their scrotum stuck on ice sculptures, but it's groundbreaking because it shows us obscenities if we Like it or not, things like no other "decent" American movie released nationwide would dare show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene in particular that I felt unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse - I don't want to elaborate. <br /> <br /> I was grinning, I nearly approached, and I was cursed to cry (out of a physical reaction to seeing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the movie of '06. <br /> <br /> Does it make me a jackass? Maybe. But if it does, I could really break less.
