The actors in this dark movie are truly credible and well-cast. The quality of the camera's work makes you feel like you are there. The play is intense and does not wander. The reason is one that will allow you to see it another time from the new perspective achieved at the end. We showed this movie to a small group of patrons at the Gadsden Center for Cultural Art. After the movie, ever the patron was eager to discuss the movie, and someone called me the next day to say they were still "bothered". While we are setting an 18-year limitation on the movie, I would watch the movie with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of a nasty situation and sets the stage for a good conversation.
