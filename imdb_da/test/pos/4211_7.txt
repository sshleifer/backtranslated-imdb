They made me a crime is a remake of a former Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, star Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a prizefighter on the lamb. Even with the limitations now of producing the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is terribly disappointed as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps to a part, he was born to play. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley, which Jack Warner thought to be busy between musicals. Berkeley would in fact soon leave Warner Brothers to MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a good job here and keeps the action flowing at a good pace. I especially like the scene where four of Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. They get it pretty narrow and with some good ingenuity. Other performances besides Garfield and the children who come to mind are May Robson, who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield's track.
