Well I saw it yesterday, and it was much better than the other proposal from VH1, because bad than this is quite obsolete, but you get to see all the employees who make the south park very interesting things. <br /> <It's also fun than this documentary depicting Trey and Matt as selfish greedy snobs creators who don't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing (which is a little ironic because they work pretty hard on the show). <br /> <br /> It also shows the whole animation process of making an episode in South Park, interviewing the actors, bringing the character's voices and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park, recommend this.
