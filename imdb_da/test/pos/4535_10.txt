Holy Schnikey! This movie clips! Duo Chris Farley and David Spade are good together. My favorite parts are "Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Oh my gosh, Room Service and several scenes that will be remembered in the years to come. This movie has a huge cult following, I wonder why, showing that even eleven years after Chris Farley is the tragic death, and he is still popular, he plays Tommy, who makes you laugh every time you still see it, he is a great comedian and is missing Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi, who made more than 2 movies together, this movie is a must buy and should be in every Snl fan collection.
