I was really surprised when I first saw this movie directed by Iain Softley; It differs in so many ways from the usual Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient Prot who claims to be from the planet K-pax who arrived at Earth with a ray of light while Dr. The Powell game by Jeff Bridges is trying to help him solve his delusions. .. First of all, I must admit that the throw is perfectly selected: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in portraying the exciting character of the Protest as he always goes in the fine line to convince us that it is genuine and then wonder whether he is deceiving or not ... Some of the pearl scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he certainly shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to the astonished astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is the subtle rational side of this movie and he delivers it perfectly. There is a completely different cast of excellent actors (like Saul Williams' convincing performance as Ernie) that makes this movie really work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has everything, elements of comedy; Sci-Fi, even a psychological thriller (about Prot's identity), but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartfelt drama. The film's main performance is quite complicated, but the director never allows it to loosen, he always keeps it credible and yet two-way interpreted. The camera and the shooting have almost a decisive role here and continue the main idea of ​​light travel. There is a lot of focus on light shadow games, lightning settings. One of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell has a crystal figure in his office that breaks the light in a beautiful way, while the whole time he suspects the idea can be true? <br /> <br /> Subtle and slow paced, exciting and comfortable, K-pax is really a gem to see, one of those kind of movies that may not be for everyone's taste, but those who see it - can fall in love with it.
