This was the very first kung fu movie I've ever seen. The headline is not the biggest, but much better than some I had seen. The reason is much better than some that are made today. It's fun at times, but that's what gives it the special touch. Academy award material is not. But if you like watching matches and a decent history backround, this is for you!
