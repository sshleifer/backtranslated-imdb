It is certainly a cult classic !! <br /> <br /> It's difficult to follow at times, but then again it's a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want standard fare, I find you can rent Care Bears Movie or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently" then I want to say that you open yourself to Enigmas and for that matter to a movie that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is that the movie was original and made me question all the way through. So even though I have seen some complaints, I would say, take the film for what it is and enjoy.
