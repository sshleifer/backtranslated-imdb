The film Night Crossing captures the feelings that most East Germans experienced in the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin during 1967 and traveled every week through the wall in East Berlin. Why? Excitement, crossing a border into a Soviet-controlled country, experiencing the smells and feelings of East Germany, why Night Crossing is excellent, it captures the feeling very much, and it is exciting. I was arrested by Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and attracted to a man in his leather coat and dark glasses I was led to believe was Stasi. When I watch the movie, I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the outdated vehicles, the worn out clothes publicly worn and the bold manufacturers in shop windows. It brings back memories of realizing how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988 I toured the GDR from east to west, north to south. East Germany has changed slightly since 1967. The trabants, who are constantly breaking down, were still the primary mode of private motorized transport, the stores still didn't show much to tempt me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, ordinary people were open and good when You had been trusted. See Night Crossing, it's so close to the truth like any movie you want to watch on shared Germany, even closer than two other favorites Spy who came in from the cold and funeral in Berlin.
