Jeff Garlin's movie is full of heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screenplay is fun; but we also get both warmth and feeling of emotional vulnerability that makes history universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performance, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The support supports bring frustration and joy into their lives to the screen in fun and heartbreaking ways. The simple joy of food, friendship, and again, when life has disappointed us, are all themes. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this movie. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's TV shows must see it!
