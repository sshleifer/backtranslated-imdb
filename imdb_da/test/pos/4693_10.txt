This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has got everything to do: remarkable script, strong characters, beautiful scenery and unique atmosphere. Add some ambient scores from Clannad and you get an unforgettable picture. I love every adventure movie from HTV I saw: Back to Treasure Island, Smugglers, Adventure, but Robin of Sherwood beats them all. I would like to thank the entire HTV production team and Richard Carpenter especially for giving me lots of adventure and excitement. I've got the DVD release in my little movie collection. I regret a lot of movies as these are not made any more.
