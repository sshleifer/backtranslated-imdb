One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy players (there were a number of such films in the 1970s). It is about an accident at a nuclear reactor and an attempt to cover it. Jack Lemmon is the employee who discovers how dangerous the plant is, and Jane Fonda is the crusader TV rep that takes the story on board and both players have the best. <br /> <br /> The events in the movie are, of course, scary and not at least removed (much of what happened here happened in fact on Three Mile Island) and although it now looks like a piece However, it just highlights how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves.
