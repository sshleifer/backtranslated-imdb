Because I love movies like "Central do Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998), I really love "Chop Shop". There is no sugar coating, there is no attempt to make these people's lives something more sweet or beautiful. What you see is what you get and it is often gritty and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's just what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, along with the fact that history unfolds so elegantly and subtly. For a young brother and sister who is as close to homelessness as you ever want to work (and live) at a car complex in Queens, New York is as good as it gets. Is it a good or bad thing? It is the question that this film is mainly for the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life piece that sometimes feels like a documentary rather than a drama, and that is a good thing because it looks and feels so right. In the meantime, so many current films are based on essentially surreal and often incredible plots that stumble across the "Chop Shop" as finding a little gem.
