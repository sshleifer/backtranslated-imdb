I've always thought that a movie that is plot is centered around a virtual reality video game, never sounds like it would be anything special, but the eXistenZ showed that I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie is incredible and at the same time very entertaining, it offers much more than that. From the beginning to the end, this film has you conceptualizing to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can't come to a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and the way it is directed is very unique to his style, and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set a clear goal with this movie and it was to keep the audience guessing what he was doing with obvious ease. His love for the grotesque is not as dominant in this movie as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are still some elements like game pods and how they are made that can twist the audience. With regard to his previous work, eXistenZ is more of a combination of Videodrome and a less violent scanner, a pretty great combination. Setting the movie in the not-too-distant future was a really good decision, as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the film's surroundings and also made it possible for him to visualize several concepts, which allows less restricted writing. It was important that the film did not become confusing, and Cronenberg avoided it very well by keeping things relatively simple. Besides, he would know how to do it much better than this if he wanted to make an indelible movie. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and everyone performs very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the standout performance as a game designer who spends more time out of reality than in it. Leigh is sexy and controls her role as Allegra, and she really gets the teeth in the role. The emotional reach she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely credible (if you can believe anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra taste. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great actors who support the film with very colorful performances. The movie is not great, but eXistenZ has determined 'quality is better than quantity' ethically, which works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and thought-provoking, eXistenZ touches social issues such as control and loss of confidence. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and can also explain why it was not a big Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer, and although it is not for everyone's taste, those who like Cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be sure to like this movie. It's one of the movies to be monitored with an open mind, but it's really something special.
