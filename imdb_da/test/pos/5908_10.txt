Jimmy Stewart brings the story of Charles Lindbergh to life as he almost tells the whole movie as he crosses the Atlantic. It was edited with flashbacks over Lindebergh's life. The Franz Waxman score is brightly brilliant and really gives the picture a heroic feeling. One of Stewart's finest roles and this movie can deliver time and time again. Look for the appearance of Murray Hamilton (Mayor of JAWS Movie) as Bud Gurney. Get out on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of a few Stewart's classic films. I consider Jimmy Stewart to be America's greatest actor and never tired of seeing him in any movie I see, see this picture and you agree.
