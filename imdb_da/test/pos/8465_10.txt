The fact that this film was shown on London's barbican suggests to me that the pressure must have been acceptable enough for such a display. Now the question is why is it not so far lost and important movie available in DVD (or even VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and the United States have hoped for many years to watch this movie if it is no different than the wonderful music written by Sergei Prokofiev. What to do to get such a wonderful production as this available to a wider audience, not just borrowers for the Barbican in London? Having been a devotee listening to Prokofiev's music for many years and paying attention to this movie, PLEASE, someone out there does the right thing and brings it out like a DVD.
