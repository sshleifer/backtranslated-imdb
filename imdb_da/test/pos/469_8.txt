This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a sixth sense ending (or perhaps a Crying Game surprise) and the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if it all makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds tell you much that you're in for a twisted trip. (I was surprised that no one went out immediately during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film sits down in a talk of two really-damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, root-up, and boy they talk about sex. Daphne brings life to her most interesting stories about escort, some are quite funny (Mr. Chang) some disruptive (Harlan scenes with music telling us what we see can now be what happens or what Daphne really feels) because I have a friend who used to escort, I can add, most seem quite real. <br /> <br /> You're alone is multi-layered and most brilliant. Okay, maybe a few minutes less of the speakers, and I don't know we would have missed anything. <br /> <br /> Then again I have to see it again and know the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked people in the Brooklyn audience to write a review on IMDb because many people read them. Query is given.)
