This almost documentary look at an entertaining boy living in body trade outside of New York is really all the way. Real lighting. Real Sound Less editing in the entire movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And while there is very little script, there is a story. Shots in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy doing something from nothing. He has a place to live that he does his own, has a good job, and tries to bring his sister into his little universe. The people in the pig park also give us a look at this culture that I didn't know about. They seem most decent and pay Ale what looks like everyday, seemingly really worried about his welfare. The actor (I think) plays Ale says more with a facial expression than you can imagine. This reminded me of what a real little movie can achieve. It shows what the children are capable of, even without much support and love. Definitely recommend.
