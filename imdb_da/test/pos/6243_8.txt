"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre, big horror movie from the 70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly traveling in a jeep through a desert area. Their other two friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel goes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and meets a pig's fate for some bizarre telekinetic chaos and some creepy mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local "tourist trap" mannequin / wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car breaks down randomly, and the girls find an oasis area to swim in, where they approach Mr. The slave who runs the road that is now closed. He picks them up to the old western wax museum, and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry go to repair their car. Eileen, the inquisitive of the two, walks to an old house nearby, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a lot of life as mannequins. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go to see her. That's when the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (can move objects with his mind) masked brother of Mr. Slausen begins killing the youth one by one while he manages his vast amount of man-made mannequins. <br /> Sound similar to the 2005 "House of Wax" remake? Well, that's it. I had heard of this movie, but never saw it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I can see the striking similarities of the two movie parts - "Tourist Trap" was of course a great contributor to "House of Wax" remake . Mannequins in this movie are scary at first, some with moving eyebrows, some without eyes at all, and some releasing mouths that also sin. The song was extremely creepy if you asked me and the mannequin was sincerely designed. Mannequins are scary at first, they are so lively, but they really aren't. The movie tightens elements from the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks that the killer uses correspond to in Leatherface), with a little bit of the original "House of Wax" and the telekinetic forces displayed in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. The telecom was a good touch to the movie, it made the killer more threatening and inevitable. The masks were scary and the patch scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The result for the movie was really well done, if not a little overused during some scenes. The action may not be very important, but it really wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shady Mr. Slauston who gave the character a shady but friendly feel. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the movie, she is best known for her role on "Charlies Angels" and recently the sitcom "That '70s Show" playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns serves as art director, he did a phenomenal job on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and does a good job here too and creates a messy, moldy atmosphere for both the rundown museum and the old mannequin-filled house. I found it a little strange that the original rating for the movie was PG, it seems a little scary to have such a tame rating, but the movie is really not too violent. Tourist Trap "is a scary unique, fast paced, highly understated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20-year anniversary DVD release, the comment was interesting and the picture was clear and sharp mostly better than the video versions. 70's slasher-horror movie, "Tourist Trap" is an underestimated retro gem.
