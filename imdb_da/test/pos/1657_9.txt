What gas in a movie! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one is separate from the rest. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can come close to this caper classic. I know that these four American movies I mentioned are not a play of their own, but rather detective stories with complicated lines of history that still radiate a "noirean", gritty quality about those resembling "Rif". <br /> <br /> What is different here is the way Jules Dassin sets in motion the overall mood of the movie, not only in the cruel realism of the principles, but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and play for yourself! The film is centered on "le Stephanois", a dark, mood and complicated ex-con that is drawn into a final shot at the big payout. Although he is an unsmiling and stubborn guy, you still feel a longing for him for some kind of redemption by exterminating himself from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin picked the right guy (Jean Servais) for that role. <br/> <br /> In addition, the rest of the history development will fall into place as we travel through the famous "silent" cape scene for the ultimate abandonment of the main "perps". Only their women survive, except for Ida, Mario's honey. They seemed best to understand the underlying in vain!
