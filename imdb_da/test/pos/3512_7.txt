I was fortunate enough to see the "Horror Classics" DVD version of this movie before it was mysteriously removed from 4 movie DVDs and replaced with something else. The picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself. But the version is still better than the one with the deluxe DVD processing. The reason is stated in Brad Fiedel's interview segments on the Special Edition DVD. He had noticed what I first found so striking about this movie. This is the use of music in moments of inactivity in the movie, but leaves the activity moments in silence, giving the horror scenes a stronger feel. The problem with this re-release is that it carries the extra movie score used to fill these intentional gaps in scores. Fiedel complained about this and made it clear that drunk music was not his. The music actually sounded like Howard Shore's Videodrome work. Sad for me, I'm also a big fan of that movie and have to connect the two. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was able to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror movie. A group of friends go up on a mountain, one of them inherited. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret. The movie moves along with a good pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I still find myself shocked to see that 45 minutes had passed before things really started to go wrong for the campers. <br /> <br /> Whilst the Horror Classics version is full of holes, in fact there is no score that comes with horror scenes, what makes this movie intelligent and even better than most slasher movies I have ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman had made some unique horror movies earlier than this, making this the most common and yet very different from the general one. It's a great fun movie with surprising plays to start. The new spiffed up DVD version is worth hiring, now the collector's Horror Classics version is now OOP worth hunting.
