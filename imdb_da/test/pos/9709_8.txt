This movie tops the previous incarnation by one mile, taking everything to the next level. As always, the JackAss guys are unbelievable and I personally shot harder in that theater than I have for a long time. Like the first JackAss, it's not as much a movie as a fifty minute long stunts and pranks. It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. In essence, these guys are the claws that debate themselves for others. And its great. Shenanigans are so low, monstrous and often obnoxious that they exceed a higher level of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can't judge this with other movies, it's in a class itself. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure play it is.
