Not all lines of a comedy are fun. This movie takes a serious issue, voting rights of voters and holds it to the light while telling jokes about it. It's the movie The Daily Show would have made if they wanted to make it a movie. I found Robin Williams to be much more fun in this movie than he was in the RV. And while my wife and I share some opposite political views, we both doubled in laughter for several parts of this movie. The scriptwriters here could give Fox News some fair and balanced lessons. Lewis Black was okay for his side, but never really seemed to be able to propagate his own comedy product for his role. Christopher Walken was also good and played his rather common bad supporting role and pushed a story together.
