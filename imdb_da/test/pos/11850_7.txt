Plot: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live the boring life. He slept before he met Alice. She has much less experience. She decides to sleep before he marries. He reluctantly accepts that they both have to see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> First, he is not really into it. His wild days are behind him, and he is simply satisfied. Until one day, Alice comes back and tells him she's done with a random guy; who of course begins to fall for her. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a bad idea that causes extreme stress on the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the train wreck coming, but still good. <br /> <br /> Worth renting.
