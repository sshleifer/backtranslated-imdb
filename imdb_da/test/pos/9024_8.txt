This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's fun and a vaguely feel-good movie. <br /> <br /> A minor but nonetheless annoying thing about the movie is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke up. Okay, most first relationships don't work for some reason, but they looked more or less like a good couple. In a nutshell, it is worth looking at escaping reality.
