If you don't mind subtitles, you like comedy and really interesting characters, along with a taste of something other than the usual American cinema, then take a chance and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (a very neurotic sweater, the other the strong, quiet, lonely type) working for a jerk butcher in a smaller Danish town, decide to say they are together and opens a butcher shop itself. Not successful at the beginning, they incorporate something new so that they are recipe and become an instant hit with the village. It's an interesting story in itself, this clever humorous movie is twisted with even more (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so fun, yet riddled with many subtle interests that make it so interesting fun, yet warm and fuzzy. One must mention is the created characters and actors make them credible. You can have the best script yet, if the characters are not credible, it can sink a movie, thus enhancing the actor, the character's credibility and history all so well that they make this a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the mood to stretch a lil, you would like to see something very good, yet done a little differently, so I suggest you rent this movie while I'm on the road to find more of director author Anders Thomas Jensen.
