Okay, this movie is a little on the hokey side. It's hard to take characters from cartoons and put them in movies with no credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), But it tries very hard. I've never read the actual cartoon, but it doesn't matter right, I assume. I judge a movie mainly on its benefits, not whether it is a faithful tale of other people's ideas. (Unless it is a movie based on a true story, it certainly requires some attempt at truth and accuracy.) So why do I give this movie a pretty high rating? Because it tries. It is trying very hard. In my book, it makes a reasonable attempt at an entertaining movie. Many films are made with vampire subjects that are the main focus. It seems that everyone has their vampire lore, be it cross, silver, garlic, sunlight, whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The story is known ... a group of vampires put together to take over the world, with a person (mainly) standing in the way. Leaves (Wesley Snipes) live exclusively on the destruction of the vampire masses that slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humanity. For the most part, mankind is blind to the fact that vampires exist around them. The vampires have even taken family members, people who strive to be vampires and do the vampire's dirty work to show how dignified they are to be "turned". Now, when I think about it, there are many elements in this movie that resemble the story of the Roddy Piper movie, They Live. A hidden enemy, hidden group of people who reach out to them, the struggle to save humanity ... everything that is also present in Blade. <br /> <br /> The play is not the best here. Snipes are at best only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, is not that bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he must Blade what Chip is for Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job here, like the "head" vampire you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this movie. From the blood-sucked vampire style rave, to the inevitable battle of the final of the film, the special effects are not half bad. There is probably enough blood to do, but it's a vampire movie, isn't it? The various forms and types of weapons Blade applications are rather unique and are not generally used in contemporary action films. Snipes have more flair with an outcast sword than he does with, says a machine gun. Plus, there is so much more thought that goes into battle with a magazine than just blowing someone away. (Unless of course you are Indiana Jones.) <br /> All in all, it's not the best action movie ever made, but it's not half bad either. As a bonus, the musical score and soundtrack are also pretty cool. Tell me in which other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek? <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
