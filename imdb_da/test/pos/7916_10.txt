Alexander Nevsky is rightly held up as a cinematic masterpiece. However, it has age very bad. People decide not to mention this and talk about the big battles and the great music. The sound effects may have been good, but apart from the distinguished body, all sounds are risible. I can be shot by movie buffs for this, but I'm sure the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and the horrible music detracts from the movie. I gave this movie 10/10 because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. However, it has its good pieces though. The costumes from the Teutonic knights are amazing, and the battle scenes are pretty good on time. However, it is a masterpiece that shows it's age.
