Long ago and far away, they knew how to make a musical, and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story of a dancer in a nightclub that becomes a girl and famous. The old saying goes here - the joy and fame do not always interfere. <br /> <br /> The dance dinners are wonderfully choreographed. What dance and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees his image showing a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at Hayworth's grandmother Maribel's aisle. <br /> <br /> A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The picture is basically the story that repeats itself at the end. br /> <br /> To add to the glory of this fine movie, there is always the always wise Eve Arden and the greeting Phil Silvers, who is called Genius in the movie.
