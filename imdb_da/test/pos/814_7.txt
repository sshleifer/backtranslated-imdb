The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless girlfriend (Paul Kelly). This girlfriend is so busy trying to start her own business that he over and over again forgets dates or shows up late. The last straw is when Sothern has a birthday, and Kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate. So, who doesn't want to stay home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but it also becomes apparent after Sothern interrupts his relationship with Kelly that the new girlfriend Hamilton is a "love" and leaves them a kind of guy. How all of this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict - just enough to say that everything seems perfect. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget as well as other level stars. It is clearly a "B movie" despite the fact that there are small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - both of whom had not yet become famous. Now it is NOT to say that these are bad actors or that the production is not good. In fact, given the production values, it is a pretty great movie, as everything seems to work so well, despite having a fairly common and somewhat predictable plot. This is because the actors and the director did a really good job of putting the story across. Plus, the authors did a great job of humanizing the characters and making you interested in them. The ending is especially really cute and practically my tear channels were flowing! Because of these factors, the film serves a 7 out of 10.
