Like most sports films, it is not surprising that people who know anything about the sport can find fault with it. As a football referee, I do not yet see a movie or TV show get it right when depicting a fight. "Forever" has good actors, but I found Sean Astin to be a little young to be an administrator in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot did not involve the protagonist who turned his fellow players into rugby players and trains on Flagstaff and Highland. Which turns into credibility: A police-controlled car just happens to pull up at the exact moment when Flagstaff's baddies pay tribute to Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a sanctioned high school national, the team is a school-based club sport - like rodeo. That said, I find it hard to believe that high school officials will allow students to play with open wounds: It has just not been done today with AIDS and hepatitis. I don't care what the tradition and the macho image are. Despite that, it was a cool movie that teens were supposed to work as adults (and sometimes did it actually). Unfortunately, too many coaches are like Flagstaffs - or worse.
