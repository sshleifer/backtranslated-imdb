The last film by John Huston, the great American director of the Irish descent, is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection "Dubliners", where the greatest author ever came from Ireland. The movie is a family affair. The dying instructor made it based on the script adapted by his son Tony Huston, from one of the most sharp, beautiful and deep short stories ever written in this language and considered by many THE BEST English-language short stories. John instructed his daughter Anjelica in what could be her finest display performance. The movie is short, just 83 minutes. It has no action sequences, no plot, it is almost non-eventful, and it may seem slow. Guests, friends and family come to the party, which takes place in Dublin during the Epiphany Week in January 1904, with two older sister's houses, which provide annual music and dance dinner. What the viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble conversation piece. Guests talk, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere and make jokes, sometimes awkward. Gradually, the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives whose memory never faded away. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you have to keep with, let it pull you in, listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate. Pay attention to the language of the body, to look at their faces as they run away from the light, laugh, and music from the present to the long gone, but never actually abandon most precious memories where the death of tithes is not dead, but eternally young and so alive. Doing so will give you the final scene of such emotional power and influence that it will always be with you. It will break your heart into pieces, pull them together and put it back transfixed. The movie as well as Joyce's story deals with Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as James Joyce's alter ego gave a very moving discreet performance) as one of the guests coming with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, feels close to and fascinated with her. It is after the party that he discovers that even after many years of presence, he does not know all about her past, her pain, her regret and the unforgettable feelings and losses she had lived through as a young girl, and he is no part of . For the first time, he looks at her and does not think of her as the indelible part of his existence, but as another human being with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time "a strange and kind shame to her entered. in his soul. "It is he who tells the final powerful and profound lines of history:" Snow is generally all over Ireland ... falling faintly through the universe and falling faintly as the decline in their end to all the living and the dead. " <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie or read Joyce's story, do it. They are truly the works of art that leave the eternal impression and will change something in you for the best.
