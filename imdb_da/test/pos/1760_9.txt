Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on Fleishers tells the whole story of Fleischer's great move from their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent exhaust of Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it is often said so, and it was Paramounts preferred version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio wanted more than anything to get their mitts on the animation study and to ease the famous brothers out of the picture. Mr. Bug gave them the pretext to do just that. - The sad end of a fantastic, innovative chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I would also like to comment that the film actually debuted on December 4, 1941, not December 7th. It could have been close enough to do the trick, however, as far as the national mood is damaging the success of the movie. But another part of the legend of this troubled little movie is that it was killed by having an accident being in the theaters at the same time. Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) still made very lively holiday shops. I have not done the study of box office numbers, but I would say that Dumo's simultaneous presence in theaters probably influenced Mr. Bug. The film shift was at a very high point during this period, and successful movies could go strong in theaters for months. - Something unthinkable in these typically short-lived, fast-paced DVD days.
