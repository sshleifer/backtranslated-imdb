I enjoyed this movie tremendously because of sharp scenes (humorous as well as ironic, some even "tragic"), believable notions, witty dialogue, and a profound reproduction of what it is like or rather may be like being hetero- and / or gay and looking for the fulfillment of your wishes. I am aware of the paradox here: homo a n heterosexual .... this is something the movie tackles at the end, but never uses caricature. If you are as open-minded as the people seem to have made that movie, eventually it will not matter to you if those who are in each other's arms are of the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "Matrix" from the matrix gives an admirable ride as a gay house salesman with "weird" appetites here, but that's not the only thing to wonder about. Enjoy.....
