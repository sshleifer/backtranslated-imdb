Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last film Laurel and Hardy produced. With the bad reputation of the duo for their post 1930's productions, I expected this movie to be horrible. Although it is not up to the standard of their "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It can be seen and in parts really fun! And certainly the plot is of the same standard as you would expect. Some gags are derived from their previous work, but when considering this movie was their first five years after their last Hollywood-produced movie, The Bullfighters, the routines are performed confidently as you would expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not too much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are fun and as such absolutely priceless. I especially enjoyed the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the end of the movie. Our hero is left on their own island. It is such a metaphor for the truth in reality. Hollywood of the time and the audience had sent the stars to a desert island of memories, and that was to be the last picture they portrayed in movies. Ollie died seven years later, and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan declined an offer to appear in "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a shame it was - a color film, just two years before he passed. But his health was probably not too much. These boys are probably the greatest comedians of all time, and although the film is far from their true potential, it is still an honor to watch them appear in movies for the last time and touch the echoes of their towering talent.
