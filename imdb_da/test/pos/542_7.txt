Everywhere But here is not exactly new, but the excellent performances of both major actresses made it worth seeing. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter moving from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict stems from the fact that Natalie would rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and she felt she was forced to travel to California with her indulgent mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Although the movie as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material new. Everywhere But here no new ground covers, but it has the rare quality of being able to take over-used topics and make it quite interesting again. Also seen in this movie, the most heartbreaking facial expression seen this year is seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother knocks her out on the side of the road, and she sees the car fading in the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot of Natalie's mother, pushing her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's much-loved home-from-home. His death is a tragic clich√© that is almost always seen in movies like this, but the rest of the film presents a number of weaknesses like this. Not good, but anywhere But here it is definitely worth looking at.
