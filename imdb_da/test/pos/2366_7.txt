This movie is amazing! Being the fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew I would love this movie. And love what I do. I finally got to buy a copy of this movie early this year. But I was annoyed to find out that it had been cut! So I'm watching car sales sales to the original version. In any case, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who is trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked! So Dennis gets supergrass, but the problem is that he doesn't know anything and starts making lies and digging himself in an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going down in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fun as expected, but it is still a great movie with some good laughs and a good soundtrack. It also has the best scene ever in a British movie (Robbie Coltrane's passage over the pier is set to "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. So if you are a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." of any of They cast members, or a fan of British comedy watch it as soon as possible !!!
