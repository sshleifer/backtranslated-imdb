You can't watch the same movie if you didn't grow up in France (or spent at least 10 years there like me). I do not know if it will ever do so outside French cultural borders (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can't translate its kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside Paris would understand the pun in "Couloirdebus", the name of one of the Roman legionaries?). But Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
