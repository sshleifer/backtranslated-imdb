I recently had the privilege to see what is said to be the last 35mm, Technicolor, stereo print and found it much livelier and touching than remembered. Also closer to the original material - basically, all the scriptwriter, N. Richard Nash, was trimmed, changed very recitively to speech dialogue and inserted a transitional scene or two (including a very entertaining for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is stagy in the "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" 50's adaptation state, but it works well for this people's folklore, unrealistic quality. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to a waving inducing degree. Moreover, for a movie of its time, it is fair - assault, violent behavior, drug use and self-destructive habits of the inhabitants of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in the narrative. But there are debits that begin with all the variation from the scene text. The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's brilliance - no wonder the family doesn't like it. The rechestration, especially of Sammy Davis Jr.'s material, is incredibly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, folks; You didn't have to tear it down so much. And while Poitier and Dandridge work well and their song doubles sing well, there is a big gap between the characters' song and speaking voices - you are constantly aware of the artwork. What really counts here, of course, is the music, among the greatest ever written to the theater, anywhere. Despite all that survives, it survives and you must be made of stone so as not to be moved by it. If the treatment is not entirely beneficial to the farm (and it should not be), there is still no reason not to spend some money to restore this ambitious admission of Gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius.
