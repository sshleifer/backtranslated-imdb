The Sagittarius is completely in place in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly American types and a murderous hotel maid. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a taxi driven by hustler Yegor. Things start to go wrong when Tatoya, the girl, the murders Yegor and William and a mad scientist introduce a piece of Yegor's brain into Wilhelms head. Robots eventually become involved, like gypsies with crushed fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell runs a pink Vespa with prissy little streamers and All-Of-Me-style physical comedy of a character in war with a voice in his brain that controls half of his body. <br /> <br /> The man with the screaming brain is an incredibly fun movie. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I have ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd) and one falls - goes murder scene, There had the whole test screening audience screaming laughing. The whole thing is a creepy uprising from start to finish and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, Bruce Campbell or B-movies in general.
