Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold that ability. <br /> <br /> (No. For many, focus is on John Lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other movie plots, transform them into beautiful puppet designs, and then greet as a genius ... but I go out.) Miyazaki has given us movies by film dealing with important mature issues (usually ecological theme) and has an intelligent script that even the most comedian who would usually conjure up any movie that was animated could enjoy if you got the chance. Yet Miyazaki never (almost) forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movie children. That being said, I am about to lose thinking of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else do you have a movie where a three-year-old (my nephew Link) will sit still during the movement, enchanted, a 7-year-old (my niece Amber) loves it all his own (and able to appreciate "star power "by Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12-year-old (my nephew Aaron) whose review was" Of course it was good! All that Miyazaki-san does is good, "a 32-year-old animated fan tears of the powerful leadership and beautiful animation (and that would be me) and a 58 year old woman (my mother) could connect with the mother characters (and I also bet the older charas) and loved the child's "beauty" characters. <br /> <br /> And that's what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way to the average movie maker. On the surface, "Ponyo" could be seen as a simple story of a little fish girl getting a taste of the human world and want to join it and the friend she makes there one little boy's name happen (a bit like "The Little Mermaid"), but there's a completely different level to play here. True to multiply, Miyazaki populates his film with strong strong female characters. Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, the elderly ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with their own and extremely strong will. <br /> <br /> But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. When she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father tries to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human by simply her own determination. <br /> <br /> When it is human, she goes with her friend Soske, whom she loves a lot (though maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the house man (at the age of five) when his mother Lisa decides to help the people in the rest of the home, working under a typhoon that has been accidentally caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He is related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) Maybe give the best performance in the movie as young Soske (which is good when he has most lines). His character is also strong will, but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you probably will not find in a childhood on this side of the Pacific. Ultimately, Ponyo's father Fujimoto must make his daughter's decision and his alienation the wife's desire to let her be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will "remember him wildly." And again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical "bad guy". Although Miyazaki (for some reason) has received some criticism for this, it is frankly what makes his movie magical and yet relative. No one in real life is quite a "bad person". All people are different shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. At a time when CGI would probably have helped with the huge amount of power images in this movie, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no CGI at all. The hand-drawn animation was definitely colored in digital ways, but each movie in this was hand-drawn and I was extremely grateful for it. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there seemed to be some lip synchronization (quite unusual for an animated film). The background seemed to be reproduced with colored pencil and had an effect entirely on the audience. This is what the animation used to look like - and what it should look like. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, the honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the whole family.
