I was very impressed with this movie from the newcomer Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The casting was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed a powerful <br /> <br /> and shocking performance as the protagonist "Rafa". It is inspiring to see independent films with this talent level. <br /> <br /> Going out requires a talent, courage and determination to make a quality movie. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to perception and walk the mile. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to judge young filmmakers harder, but I welcome "Jose Reyes" <br /> <br /> and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
