*** Spoiler in fifth section *** This was a fantastic frank image (uh-huh, uh-huh) picture for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took a chance by making it, the Motion Picture Association of America balked at certifying a film that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringe full of heroin in his arm. Frank Sinatra took a chance both to play a dependent musician and to fall flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much as he had done. All in all, these gambles paid off, the movie is a classic, although it is not perfect. Nelson Algrin's novel may be great, but it has far too much to fit comfortably into a two-hour movie 'The Man with the Golden Arm' is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. But in my opinion, it's not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) doing the movie, but the other characters and their subplots, all involving Frankie. In the end, it is not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him, and he feels very much. When the pressure gets too much, the drums begin to knock on the sound track, and Frankie crosses the street with his well-dressed "friend" Louie. <br /> <br /> To say, Frank Sinatra's music career was ever really in the doldrums, but in the early 50's he was in limbo between his days touring with big bands and the Las Vegas era. 'From Here to Eternity' established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer again, but 'The Man with the Golden Arm' was still a major challenge, the whole show swimming or swimming with his performance. He pulls it off with such a skill that I for several minutes at a time forgot that I saw Frank Sinatra, he must have known junky musicians and exploit that knowledge to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Alongside Billy Wilders masterpiece 'The Lost Weekend', more emphasis is placed on the sociological causes of addiction in 'The Man with the Golden Arm'. While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend') seems to fight most against himself, Frankie Machine is obsessed with external forces and he takes refuge in the needle. Neither approach is quite right or wrong, mostly because addiction is impossible to explain fully, but it seems that this movie may have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the clich√©'s reliance on "ending cold turkey." I realize that 'The Man with the Golden Arm' is likely to set the trend ahead of following it, but that doesn't make it any better. At the beginning of the film, Frankie to all fates has kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some kind. Of course, the film's drama requires him to strike down, but I found the all-American ideal that a man alone should face his problems (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) out of here. Cold turkey and riding in the sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar, but in my opinion it was a little less rosy.
