Okay, no one in their real mind would download a movie titled "The Man with the Screaming Brain" and expect it to be serious. This is a scandalous b-movie, which means a real hokey plot, strange characters, clich√©s, over-the-top action and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For the odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that sort of thing, this is a gem. That play is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings an exciting, compelling performance. His physical comedy skills are really impressive in this movie and go back to "Evil Dead" movies.
