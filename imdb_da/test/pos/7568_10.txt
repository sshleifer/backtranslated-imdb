Zeke Rippy (Mic) is amazing, you believe in his character. And it's scary like hell, I spent half the movie covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's cold to see something that is exciting and scary, it's not all blood and gut - but it gave me bad dreams. Basically, it's a good movie - see the first chance you get.
