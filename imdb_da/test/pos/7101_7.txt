This film marked the end of the "serious" Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello meet with monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate and yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster and Dracula a "last" time. <br /> <br /> I say desperately, because in the previous movie, "House of Frankenstein", both Dracula and Wolf Man are killed according to how vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula at sunlight and wolfman with a silver ball). Once again, they return to the House of Dracula without explanation. This movie could have played as a kind of prequel to the House of Frankenstein if the Frankenstein monster plot would not chronologically enter House of Dracula from the House of Frankenstein and if the wolf man was not healed. Then there would be no plot holes. But as this is not the case, none of the Dracula and Wolf Man plots make any sense. <br /> <br /> But unlike these plot holes, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie that is fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially to see the wolf being healed. I know I just said this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him being healed after all this time. And the scene with the lady who played "Moonlight Senada" on the piano, then suddenly played a scary melody when it was under Dracula's spell, was very scary. Dr. Edleman's conversion to the "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" character was also done very well. <br /> <br /> And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man together, a "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
