"Seeing Other People" is a bold romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and planning to become cowardly. They live together, but both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes that she has had so few sexual relationships in the past, she can just marry Ed because she never felt anything else. So they agree to start fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a previous question - by focusing too much on "What if?" aspects of life, can it actually do the opposite and make you feel more limited? When Ed starts having sex with a college girl, he begins to become addicted and almost forgets Alice - when he understands this, he scares him. <br /> <br /> I didn't hear anything about this movie in advance, but I enjoyed it. It's not extremely well-made and certainly has the purposeful low-budget indie feel - but it is much better than most romantic comedies out there in the regular day. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you get a chance.
