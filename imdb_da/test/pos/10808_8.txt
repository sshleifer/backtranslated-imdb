If there were two parts that the physically towering, ugly charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born as a Frenchman to play, it certainly must have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the mayor Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film both through the width of his shoulder and the power of his voice; His charisma carries that part despite the fact that it is clear that the character has so much blood on his hands as the rest of them. Danton festivals, while Paris's people are starving ... but he is the only man to challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Public Security Committee called "Freedom" and he is presented as the film's hero - despite the fact that the source player almost idolizes his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the signs of the story, there is interest in identifying the smaller parts: the seed faced Tallien, Couthon the Cripple, the Fouquier-Tinville tribunal, the dashing fop St Just, the epic painter David. But the manuscript cuts a little limp in this regard; Names are often late on the road if there are no smaller characters, and there is no Hollywood style 'info-dump' to ensure that audiences can place events in their historical context. The film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what will happen - sometimes it takes too much for granted, as when it depends on a close knowledge of dates to give stitches to the tail of it. the fact that Robespierre followed Danton cards to the scaffold. <br /> <br /> Considered movie, it is not entirely satisfactory because it ebbs away towards the end. The structure of history leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists of the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial, which, thanks to history, never actually happens. Things just fizzle out: there is no rebellion, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of the power of victory, there is no triumph on either side. It may be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory as the result of a screen scenario - it seems a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the Terror and show in the apposition the rape of Robespierre.
