The famous film maker Werner Herzog's "Fata Morgana" is breathtaking unorthodox. Although characters appear in the movie from time to time, there is no real story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. It's a movie without an accompanying manuscript. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical tale of VO, whose combination overlays a large number of images from mostly but not exclusively Sahara desert. Some of the pictures are wonderfully strange and out of the ordinary. The camera captures ghost images or mirages, optical illusions that tantalize and fascinate. <br /> <br /> This general cinematic trend is drawn by occasional observational pages on serendipitous topics. For example, a man with goggles in a row provides a mini-tutorial on the lizard. And in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence, a small betting room contains a man with dark goggles singing in a voice completely distorted by the microphone he uses, accompanied by an old punchy lady tune on an old piano. Neither the man nor the old lady seem to enjoy what they are doing. Where baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has an underlying concept that unites the wide variety of strange images and eclectic sounds. But that concept is so subtle, so opaque that you will never find out without help. From this subtle theme, the film really makes sense. However, without this reference level, the film may seem boring and infinite, a meaningless parade of random earthly images and esoteric narrative gibberish. <br /> <br /> Unapologetically redundant, thematically confusing and cinematic heretics, "Fata Morgana" will probably either make you dizzy with joy or make you vomit. You will either be locked to the movie's Zen-like qualities or be tempted to smash the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing that most viewers agree on: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
