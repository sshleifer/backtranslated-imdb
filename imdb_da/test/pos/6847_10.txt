I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was exceptional, probably her best in her career. Her facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly true to nature, and they were best exploited by Director Gutierrez. All actors and actors were very good at their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. Her recording capacity is far beyond what would be necessary for this character, so she actually improves it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is, though sometimes exaggerated, entertaining and pointing to the end. Very very good. A movie that should not be missed. A story well-woven and radiant. Quality of film, excellent.
