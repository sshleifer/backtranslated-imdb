A truly eerie ghost story full of chills and sensuality, this movie only falls under what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps a little too much depends on a simple premise. Mostly it is imaginative and really gripping, but ultimately it almost lost Oshima's interest in it and brought it to a quick end. The story is simple - a woman and her younger loved one kill her husband so they can be together. But their failure of the nerve and his recurring ghost condemns them madly. Its beautifully handled with imaginative scenes and the love passion is depicted beautifully. But all too often, the film really fails to deliver on its promise, almost as if Oshima loses its nerve in the same way as the lovers do. It's a valuable movie to watch just to see how Oshima combines his great skill as a filmmaker with some exploitation movie tricks to pull the audience together, but unfortunately it's not a true classic in the form of movies like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
