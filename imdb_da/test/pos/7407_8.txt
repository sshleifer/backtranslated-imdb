If you are easily interested in the war between states, this movie is worth seeing. It's amazing historical storytelling. No flashing saber, no cavalry fees, no carnage - only the story of an excuse group of Union soldiers who stumble into a Confederate woman and her son's farm and allow as much as their captain's conscience allows. This amount moves up and down as events unfold, affecting his human sense contrary to his sense of duty to his men and his cause. Ultimately, he comes to a compromise that any of us would be hard at the top. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historical treatment of the Kentucky war, a slave state that tried to remain neutral, but eventually chose to remain in the Union under mysterious political conditions involving the detention of certain legislators. About half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there has never been much treatment of how it was to have lived there during those times. This movie makes a big contribution just in the "look and feel" of time and place.
