The different Law & Order and CSI franchises had been better happy Dolomite didn't go through. The lady police, ADAs and coroners would all be thrilled and the men are subject to such soul shaking, badge melts chain speed kicks (Wouldn't you just love to see David Caruso's Horatio and it knows everything at CSI get Dolomites Hush Puppies pulled from their respective donkeys) Ice T can start crying and get back on the Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low low budget, poor but enthusiastic plays, and a vision on which gutbucket nightclubs are offered to its customers, funk bands souls singers, the latest cases of old-style Chitlin Circuit entertainers (like weirdling dance troupe) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and a host of others came from these clubs to honor while their peers worked on local or regional star. Rudy Ray Moore came from that background, and the character of the Dolomite is a mix of the daring Black badasses that stroked through. He should not have gone in common, the pigs did not have a guarantee how his medieval self-service maintained a loyal staff of kung fu wenches is a mystery, only a pupil of cultures can explain, but all that is next to the point. It's a wonderful home video from a legendary performer who, compared to mirrors from actors ranging from established Hollywood to indie movie string parties, hits his mark. A funny silly movie!
