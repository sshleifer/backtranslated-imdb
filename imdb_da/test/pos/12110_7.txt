A rare long-standing Kinski feature role as Crazy Johnny sex crazed outlaw, who is wanted in San Francisco. China's character is obsessed with raping women as a sexual predator in the old west, who has nothing but stealing, rape and killing on his mind. This movie is perhaps a big disappointment to many Spaghetti Western fans, but not to many Klaus Kisnki fans. All in all, it had two things that went for it, a fantastic achievement by Klaus Kinski and a fantastic music score by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story line that required a lot more work done to be implicit but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie redone in the future. Since most old films are being re-made nowadays.
