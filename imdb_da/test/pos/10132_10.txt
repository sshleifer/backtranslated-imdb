Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who played perfectly in this movie. It is a heartwarming story that confirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The screenwriter did not introduce racism into the movie in a way that most movies do, which I thought created a more realistic story. <br /> <br /> Authors tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism, but usually go overboard. <br /> <br /> There are so many cities like this where people in different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Academy Award because he was great as a leader and coach, realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when he helped Radio.
