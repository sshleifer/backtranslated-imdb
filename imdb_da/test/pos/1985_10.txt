So let's begin!))) The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's films would usually look ... My intention to see it was determined that JJL was one of my favorite actresses. She is as lovely as usual, this sweet! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to say it was my favorite movie of hers. It is still interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the molding isn't extremely impressive, but it's not a kind of miscast star array. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
