First I played the other monkey island game and I liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. So a few months later I found out that a new game was made. I tried it and liked it very much. The first thing you notice is the great graphics. The areas are large, colorful and detailed, with plenty to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, much as always. The game is challenging, with all points and click games, frustrating. The witnesses have not become old a third time around. The animated cut scenes are also a good addition to the game. This is the best MI game out there, maybe the best P&C game too! If you like cartoon-like games that play like a movie, get this game!
