Excellent movie with Anthony Wong, who certainly lives up to the title. Erotic, but more violent, courtesy of dreams bought from a bile occultist who quickly becomes a nightmare of some size when the wizard enters them to manipulate poor Mr Wong. Well filmed and very fast moving this is a non-stop tale of serious magic, herbal medicine, power and corruption, but also time for some fine sex scenes and very bloody violence. There is also just a little touch of humor every now and then to catch you farther away and it all makes it a most exciting 90 minutes or so. Excellent performances throughout.
