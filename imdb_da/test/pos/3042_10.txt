I watched this movie on TV in the UK 25 years ago and it has been the subject of me since then. My interest has recently been revived by visiting Hilton Head - the next island across from "Yamacraw" (actually Daufuskie) and reading Pat Conroy's outstanding "The Water is Wide". With the benefit of knowledge, I have recycled Conrack and regard it as a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures Conroy's spirit, and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> Three things still concern me about this narrative: 1. The issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same. 2. Education is about more than reading and writing. 3. These children were my colleagues, I was 6 in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year at Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why hasn't this made it to DVD yet?
