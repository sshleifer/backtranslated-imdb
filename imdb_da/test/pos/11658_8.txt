I read the book before I watched the movie, and the movie is one of the best adaptations out there. Very true and true to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are wonderful. Robbins is a talented filmmaker, and I wish he would add more to his repertoire. He made the movie very scary and intentionally slow to add depth. A particularly brilliant bit of filming was the reflection of the victims in the glass in the execution room at the end.
