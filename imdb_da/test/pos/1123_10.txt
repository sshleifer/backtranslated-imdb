This show is amazing. It gives all that great drama and romance in teen shows like The OC and Dawson's, but it's a lot more fun. It is a show of morals and values ​​without everything being sugar-coated and sanitized (ala 7th Heaven.) We do not have sororities or fraternities in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how exactly the Greek life is portrayed. But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love a racist, homophobe confederate flag-waving Bible basher must be genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Excuse me, Josh Jackson, you've been felled!
