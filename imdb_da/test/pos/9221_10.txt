I loved this, but I'm an 80 year old child. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I don't know if small these days would be very interested in the show, it wasn't mine. (But it was okay, I bought it anyway for me. I just brought the little one, so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me fun.) I don't love the violent drama and the colorful landscape. It reminds me of a simpler time before the cartoon had more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Though I might just be a little biased on the subject. Afterall I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they are making a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Laugh out loud.
