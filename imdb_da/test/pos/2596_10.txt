Chuck Jones' Rabbit Seasoning, the other in the much-loved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. Although I find it almost impossible to choose from this trio of amazing comics, I should admit that 'Rabbit Spice' is the most subtle script. Here, emphasis is placed on languages ​​such as Bugs and Daffy running through a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of Abbot and Costello's "who is on the next" routine. As a long-term Daffy fan, I have always been fond of the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun trouble" is one of the all-time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs play the role of cool manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is the imprisoned punk. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he just kicks back and has a bit of a laugh. Elmer falls into every trap that is added to him, but it is poor old Daffy coming out of the worst, being shot in face again and again, his beak ending in more and more ridiculous positions. It all depends on the inevitable climax declaration "You are despicable". As an intricate example of Chuck Jones impeccable timing that you come across, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.
