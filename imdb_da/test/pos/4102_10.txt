I watched this movie a few years ago and quickly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent. Bacharach's music is endearing and should be given the recognition it deserves right. The kinematics are amazing. Critics hated it, but they also hated home alone. I haven't found it on video, but welcome anyone who can find a copy.
