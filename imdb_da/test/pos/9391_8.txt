"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is an extremely unusual scary movie that really has to be seen as belief. There is an old four-poster bed that just loves eating people, and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie on it. There is also a long dead artist, imprisoned behind one of his paintings, giving a voice-over tale. George Barrys is the first and only film that gives some truly surreal moments as the bed absorbs its victims into a mysterious sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of doing, unfortunately the premise is pretty stupid and the play is amateurish. As a fan of unusual movie theater I enjoyed this low budget oddity. Give it a try.8 out of 10.
