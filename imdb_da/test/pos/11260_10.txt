What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started to see it with every intention to change the channel if it started to be paralyzed as so many anti-narcotics do, but I was sucked into this movie and I couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl did a fantastic job with his character, and in my opinion he really made the film something worth seeing. I was interested in buying the audio track for the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was no help at all, but believe it or not. Amazon.com makes regulations for the August 5 release of the movie on DVD. I know I had a hard time tracking it, and I'm sure other people might have had the same problem. I buy my own copy so I can throw myself over Nick Stahl while I blow my eyes at the same time thanks to the emotional story!
