Vanaja is a film of superlatives. It has an exceptionally well-thought-out cast with Mamatha as the rugged jewel, excellent production and possibly preproduction with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey in rural southern India through the eyes of a 15 year old, a remarkable mix of song and dance, traditional and modern, blended perfectly, and a beautiful backdrop of lush colors of flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a great achievement for a debut leader !! The castings were absolutely dead. I wish India would come out with more of such films. This movie will remain as one of my best favorites for my entire life. 10.9.
