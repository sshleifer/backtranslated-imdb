It is not to say that five fingers of death / king's trench are somewhat smaller than a classic in itself, because it is. Like many of the leading characters in many martial arts films, the character Lieh plays low through most of the film for a reason - but when he cuts loose, he effectively cleans the house. You can't ask for more than that.
