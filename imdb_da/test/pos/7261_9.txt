I've seen the previews everywhere before I decide to see it. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist of the 18th century england. Although the music in the dance scene was obviously modernized and also Liv Tyler's clothes colors (although it is beautiful!), It fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want it, check this out. Very different from other 18th century detailed films.
