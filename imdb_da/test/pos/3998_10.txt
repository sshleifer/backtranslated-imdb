This movie may be a bit boring for some people, but I find this movie <br /> <br /> very interesting in an attempt to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director Lim has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. The film before this showed the music throughout the film, and this film tries to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie like a painting. Another thing is, the story is written by both the director and a philosopher, Kim, who is a well-known researcher in Korea (much in degrees - including a doctor at Havard) I am not saying that educated people get better movies, but the philosopher is expert in traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit to this movie.
