I really enjoyed this movie. I am usually not one for adventure or faith on floors, but this movie captured my attention. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie on the British Channel Hallmark ... which usually shows a couple of sticky movies ... but then Snow Queen came together ... and I loved it! I really really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... she plays snow queen brilliantly and glamourously. <br /> <br /> I don't want to explain what history is about, as other people have already done, so there's nothing to repeat. <br /> <br /> I would just suggest that if you want to see a fun adventure trip ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and you live in the UK, you might have a hard time. I bought it from South Korea brand new (English edition of course).
