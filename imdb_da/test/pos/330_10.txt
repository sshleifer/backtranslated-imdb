To tell you the truth, I don't speak Tamil, and I didn't understand the movie. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, which far name) explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have seen many more films from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actor "Simran", which beauty. Give her a prize for the best possible appearance. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on. I smell an OSCAR winner. I didn't understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great instructor, and I hope his next movie was a success.
