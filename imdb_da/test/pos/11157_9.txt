Okay, I know it's clich√©. Taken on the surface, this is a bad movie - perhaps in a league with "Plan 9 from outer space". The dialogue is suspected (but Singlish is quite funny ...), the plot is not entirely credible, Gavin's character surpasses excess. While watching the movie, something really happens to make you wonder ... Handsome and Kim make a tank, Gwen eats a banana in a bath, almost everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!"). These things taken separately may be wrong. Overall, however, they are only characteristics. Watching this movie with an open mind (especially if you are not familiar with the Singaporean culture) and with an open group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time. You can't go into this movie, expecting a masterpiece, or even expecting to take something serious at all. If you can take this movie for what it is - an underdog movie about underdogs, filled with the brim with its own quirks - then you have to look at it! I've already seen it three times and I wouldn't hesitate to see it three times !!
