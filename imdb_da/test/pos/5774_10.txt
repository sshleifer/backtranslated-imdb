Hi, I wondered if anyone has a copy of the film Broken Promise ?? I loved this movie growing up and saw it every time it was on. It's been years since I've seen it and would love to get a copy. I have checked the entire internet and have not been able to find it. If anyone has a copy to trade or sell them, please contact me at NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thanks and good night !! Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to the eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen whose parents left her and her siblings. Michaelsen has had to look helplessly as her brothers and sisters are divided and bred to different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Juvenile Officer Chris Sarandon ends Michaelsen in his fight to reunite his family under a roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first broadcast on May 5, 1981.
