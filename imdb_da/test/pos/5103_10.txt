Peter O'Toole, one of our finest actors, is magnificent as a reserved school leader dedicated to teaching young boys. He meets a show girl and falls in love. The story is one of love and affection. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not to mention a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this movie, although the ending may not be a happy one. I enjoyed it.
