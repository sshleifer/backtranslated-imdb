Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the Southern <br /> <br /> California desert using its patent-faux documentary style, Watkins creates <br /> <br /> a movie like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> pre-convicted of the second postdress) throughout the image. After <br /> <br /> they have been tried by a military court, they have the choice either <br /> <br /> to impose a prison sentence or they can participate in the penalty <br /> <br /> Park (one staggering three days hike through the desert with nothing but <br /> <br /> clothes on the back while being chased by local law <br /> <br /> enforcement officers using the park as a live action training <br / > the earth. I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels like <br /> <br /> you see a real documentary. This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible <br /> <br /> movies available. I advise you to take care of it. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
