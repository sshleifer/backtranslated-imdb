This show is brilliant fun! I began to see in 2007 and had never heard of it before then. After an episode, I was hooked. I'm never home to see it so my wife bought me the whole series on DVD. Don't stop laughing, should I say more? I wish it was still on TV because it's definitely worthy and much better as long as I'm on TV. I wish they would make a movie, seriously, who wouldn't see it. Kevin James's name alone will bring a great fanbase to any movie that the guy is (makes your stomach hurt) fun. Just a really good ground on earth, trustworthy show. If you have the chance to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
