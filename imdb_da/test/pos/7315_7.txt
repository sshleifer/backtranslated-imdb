I found this to be more chaotic than the average Stooges card (as strange as it sounds). There were several fun pieces, especially the running gags ("Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", The glass door breaking, Stooges running into the supply room and coming back with ... Well, you know), but also A bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make me sense. I must assume that these were generally the beginning of scenes from the movie "Men in White", but since I don't know much about that movie, I can't say it for sure. Maybe if anyone could explain these, I would appreciate this briefly more.
