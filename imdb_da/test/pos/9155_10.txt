I loved this show, but then I can't remember ever loving anything he did, starting with "Americanization of Emily". A city sheriff trying to steal the city blind and ride out to Mexico must love it. Like everything he does, it has a tongue in the taste of the cheek that feels it as a garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and movies, but somehow it never becomes obsolete. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: Killed the protagonist <br /> <br /> If I remember, the "good" brother was killed and replaced with the "evil" twin in an attempt to increase the ratings, ie. Do it more like any other Western on television at that time. I think this show was too far ahead of its time and I still miss it. TV without a Jimmy G show is missing something.
