The good thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest movie is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you have to take it as minus, but in reality it is a big plus. Park takes the method of vampireism seriously, and also the rugged love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts between both characters - Sang-hyeon is a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that he does not become aware of, makes him a sick but sand-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with his mother and "idiot" brother, the latter is killed by singing as in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly scary or scary about the story and the signs at any point in time, and the implications of the religion are early (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer of battles as he rose from the dead thanks to his vampireism, even as he just can't be and knows it) on top of them about good against evil, push it up in another plane cinematically. <br /> <br /> This thirst also rises to the amazing artistic standard that Park has shown with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a Cyborg, but that's OK, should be taken as a given. Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre subordinate characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satirical, part romantic / erotic, part dramatic and finally fantastic. And it doesn't always treat vampirim as something of a simple horror movie setup (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It is more akin to the movie Near Dark, which never mentioned the word vampire, but tells it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of clear attention, and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence might be frightening than killing or bloodshed. When you see a vampire jumping up really high or healing its wounds, you've seen them all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, like Oldboy, only here with a bite intended to emphasize bizarre physical states. An example of this can be found in the priest's sense of turning off blood from humans in coma by taking their blood tubes and sucking on the floor. Or the way Tae-Joo holds on to a human scrap by keeping her mother alive, even though she has had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and push a finger as a means of responding to the blood suction I have brought pain and horror to her home. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What thirsts in the mind is how elements come together, by drama and existential pain, by a bunuelic surrealistic sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamics of the song hyeon and the other priest who gives up his arm for blood sucking but really also being a vampire) and of the erotic: the scenes where the pastor finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible at their pace and length of shot and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic way, but in the sense of these characters' release and escape, which does not last long over the reach of history. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, it's nothing to carp about. Not all movies, Chanwook Park directs, will reach his masterpiece's stature (and at least he will always be known as the man who directed that movie). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious strip of vampire films in general. The film production is sharp and exciting and even dangerous (and what white space in the daylight the characters live in!), Humor is dark and fun, the play is intense and moody - especially from subtle lines from Song Kangoo and the incredible evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK wine, and the end when it finally gets there is one of the really amazing vampire movie finishes you talk about for years in a good way. In a fight between thirst and dusk, thirst takes the first round. Between Let the right one be in or near dark, it's harder to call. 9.5 / 10
