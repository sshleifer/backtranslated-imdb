Remember, this movie was made by Robert Downey senior. a very good entertaining black consciousness feature that was an underground hit in California-los angeles and new york at that time. a hippy loved classic where, changes that occur in business are striking, refreshing and interesting comedy.non-compliant, not as the basic society of 1969 now looked, is still very good, but today's life in America is quite different from 69 . good for baby boomers
