The inspiration for the "Naked Gun" films casts Leslie Nielsen - who only recently started making comedy * - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, who always has to solve an absurd case. Like "airplane!" and the films based on the series depend on the humor of Mel Brooks-style spotter and stupid comments (namely "yes it is" the remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame is where something keeps moving. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the show only had six episodes. At least it created the movies. You can't go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these roles. I suppose they all had fun filming it. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!" Had Leslie Nielsen played in films such as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". As recently as 1987, he co-starred in "Nuts" with Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first "Naked Gun" movie, it has all been comedy all the time.
