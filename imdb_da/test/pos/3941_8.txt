are you crazy or what? This movie has the talent to criticize a movie made by famous directors and producers? I think you should look at some crappy versions because if you had a proper version, you wouldn't think it was a low resolution image graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who enjoy the hong kong cinema on the other side of what Asian people enjoy watching .. you are such a sellout .. hongkong cinema is quite different from Hollywood's, hk cinema is in a class though ... so if you don't enjoy watching movies from hong kong producers, don't go and walk around how it's a waste of time to see .. just let others enjoy the movie .. and personally i have seen this movie and i love his story and the way it was made ..
