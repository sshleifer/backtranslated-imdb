As a fan of old warnerbrothers gangster movies, I had to check this out, it was the 2nd best movie in the DVD set with adventure classics that also had one of my favorite movies, Scott of the Antarctic on it. It was made in 1939 a good year for many warner brothers movies, it boasts a great cast; John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and the final children, who will later be known as Bowery boys on monogram images. Well a boxer (Garfield) gets the frame for a murder he did not commit and is fleeing and is tailed by a tough new york detective (Claude Rains), he ends up in a fruit gathering run by a beautiful woman (Gloria Dickson) and dead end children (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) later he returns to boxing, but tries to keep a low profile. It was led by the famous director Busby Berkley, who directed timeless classics such as 42nd street, goldigger from 1933 and 35, footlight parade and many others. I would like to give a shout out on platinum dvd / video to put a lot of good cheap price DVDs as adventure classics (see my Scott of Antarctica review) I give them made me a criminal 10 out of 10, great movie. I just have to mention that I only saw 2 John Garfield movies, this one and the body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
