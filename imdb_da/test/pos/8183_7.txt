Quite a production from the director, telling the story of Qin Keizer's ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms in China. Some beautiful figures, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not blown away by the movie regarding the actors' ability (which was good, I enjoyed the marquis most) or its appearance (although the mass of troops was extremely impressive if it were a real man, there are a lot of extras !). <br /> <br /> I've seen Li Gong in other movies and she's always great. Good period piece I think but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and found 2 1/2 + hours not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 out of 10.
