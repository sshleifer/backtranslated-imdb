This is one of the best "Bloke" films from the early 90s, and while it is a bit dated, it is one of the films that will never be made today, which makes it very special ! In fact, a very similar movie was made in the 90s called "Masterminds", and it was a PG variation on the same theme, but it was not as close as fun or realistic for that matter. So what's so special about this movie? It is comradre between the protagonists and against all odds themes in the movie. Sean Astin is very sympathetic and has played in some of the most memorable films in the 80/90s, especially "The Goonies". He also went on bigger things with "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, but "Encino Man" is a good ride down memory. "Wheaton from" Stand by Me "will give good support to the movie and Andrew Divoff is a great villain. Louis Gossett Jr sleeps in his role, but he adds some brevity to the film, especially his relationship with Astin's rebellious nature. So how's the action? With today's standards, it is pretty dull and cheap to watch almost like a television movie, but the production values ​​are good and the violence is actually quite unpleasant for a movie involving school students. However, the director is the limited budget with some exciting moments and well-placed humor. <br /> <br /> Park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick, but don't expect Oscar material!
