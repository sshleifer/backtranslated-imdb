This is another Western about a greedy cattle baron seeking to push out small ranchers and farmers. It has certainly been done before and since. But the violent men are something special. What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck, who plays the role of the vix, which she often did in her later films. She is married to the stunted Edward G. Robinson, who is the master child here, but Robinson is paralyzed and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him relentless. No matter for Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. It doesn't fit well with either Dianne Foster, Robinson and Stanwyck's daughter, nor with Lita Milan, Keith's Mexican pig wine. <br /> <br /> The sub-plot of infidelity almost takes the film, but Glenn Ford as a stalwart little ranch who is a civil war veteran comes west of his health manages to keep himself here. He's every inch the quiet western hero that people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect the famous words of Wild Bill Elliott to get out of Ford's mouth, "I'm a peaceful man." Would have been very useful in The Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> Fifties were the adult's age, the themes went into the horses that had not been explored before. The following year, Glenn Ford would make another Western, Jubal, one of his best, who also explores adultery as a plot. There are probably traditional western things in the violent men and plenty for those who rely on soap operas as well.
