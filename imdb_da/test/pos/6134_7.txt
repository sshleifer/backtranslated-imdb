Yes, I saw this mini-series with my mother and father as a child. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9 year old mind could actually follow. I remember it was very well done and did not necessarily feel the typical crap mini series. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. Although most phrases in this movie are spelled out or predictable, it's still worth it. I haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet. I can't imagine it. They have to play it on the history channel or something.
