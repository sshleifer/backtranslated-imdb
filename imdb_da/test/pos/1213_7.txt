Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not a completely successful one. The ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as in many early ways there is too much filler in between. The audience comes to almost everything and, as always, gives us the reliable advertising team of Gorilla & The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania was totally unheard of at this time, only doing things that were much more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "The Model" Rick Martel. For a 3 or so minute match, this is as good as it gets. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was pretty damn good. Martel wins with Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Huge Pop for Demolition. The match is quite boring, I often had trouble paying attention. Others didn't really do much, so somehow it was more like a 2 in 1. There is solid talent involved here and it's a shame they couldn't produce better. Demolition wins the titles, with Pattened maneuvering from the top. Crowd blows to the finish. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard boring filler match, with the earthquake doing its thing. I'm not really a fan either, so it didn't give much interest to me. Quake wins with his seat plate. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs. Mr.Pefect / W Geniuset. Dying Pop for Bruti. Really good match up, with unfortunately not enough time to develop even more. It was really my interest and is still one of my favorites on the map. Beefcake wins with a shot to the post, much to the audience's approval. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. Huge pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring fight, it does not know what it will be. Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Remarkably for Roddy, half-black paint and call himself "Hot Scott" <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Hart Foundation Vs Bolsheviks. Record breaking, but apart from that, nothing to see here. Hearts win with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time it got, but observable. The crowd was rather dead for it, except for the Heenan's intervention. Jessie's scary cracks, whether Tito's food is more entertaining, so fight it yourself. The barbarian wins with an unpleasant look, flying clothes line from the top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Dusty & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. Big pop for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, which looks amazing, I must add. I thought it was OK. At least it was lively, if not something big. I'm not a fan of Dusty 'so. Dusty and Safir win when she rolls up Sherri. <br /> <br /> Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. Crowd is pretty anemic for this surprising. Decent without a doubt, but with these guys it should have been better. The constant focus with Fuji usually detracts from the fight. Express wins by counting when Janetty is nailed with salt. <br/> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Jim Duggan vs Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan as an idiot, brings out the American flag in Canada. Duggan also gets solid boo to it, but it can also be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Crappy fight around, I don't care about Duggan, but that's not why it sucked. Too short in the end, that really matters. Duggan wins when he whacks Bravo in the back, with the two at four. The mist is sprayed for its problems. <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs. Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow spots, but since everything was said and done, I was fine. Two regular wrestles that gave it to everyone all resulted in an entertaining battle. Crowd gets noticeable Ancy during parts of it though by making the wave. Dibiase wins by counting out. Jake has the last laugh at giving some of his money away, much to the joy of the people. <br/> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman vs Akeem / W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end. Akeem was a gimmick, I was never too fond of. Bossman wins with his slam. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The rhythm & blues segment was largely a failure. Crowd was not in it <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a filler match, before the main event, it wasn't that bad. If it had time to get more, it would have been excellent, certainly. Rude wins, with the Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title to title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champ | This one is about the atmosphere of the crowd, and the split crowd reaction, for the most part. The warrior got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion, it was a bit of astonishing. Hogan dwells completely with his. It is one of Wrestlemania's best games in history. With two people who are not really known for that wrestling, they succeeded in creating a great match that was spoken for years. I have seen this many times, and my respect level grows higher for each one, for their efforts, given that I am not a fan of either. Even deadly fanatics who demand pure wrestling cannot beat this one! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining post if nothing too special. It is memorable for the main event, location and crowd, but it is not one of the best if you ask me. That said, I enjoy it and I give it my recommendation to fellow fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
