I caught this on the Chicago IndieFest and have to say you are alone much more fun than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. Don't have HA Wedding Crashers are fun, but sick, twisted, I can't believe she just said it, but it's so wonderfully fun. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl, who deserved the best actress, is great to see. There is never a moment when you think oh, I see a movie and she is an actress. She is too desperate for words. In fact, there are 2 scenes that I still giggle over and I will not give them away, but in one she is in the bathroom and talks about how much she gets paid for performing a particular service and how "awesome" it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience secretly think of the same !!!) In another, she talks about a teenager's definition of "sex" in relation to an adult, and if that is not the true dialogue I have heard in a movie for a long time, I do not know what is.
