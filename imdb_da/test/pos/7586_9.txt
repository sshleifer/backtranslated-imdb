I have watched over 2000 Studio-Era audio films - including lots of Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones, and Deanna Durbin's own Universal features - plus a decent amount of live and studio recorded musical comedy and opera. And I assure you that no one's task is to sing in front of a camera and a microphone, or maybe ever ever. EVERYWHERE YOU HAVE BACK DURBIN'S SOLO here ... mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and everything. The child from Canada sings this bit from "Il Bacio" as she lived and wrote it herself and then came to appear for a retrospective in Italy late in her career, not as a child who taught it from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you skip this extra on the DVD - or move on to the Garland Solo, you will only be deprived of yourself as this cheap MGM teaser just happened to catch one of the biggest performances of 20c.
