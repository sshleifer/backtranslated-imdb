Great movie about an American G.I. who ends the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and such? Meanwhile, her brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Werewolves, whose purpose is to drive away residents (one can remember that the same group plays a major role in Lars von Trier's film Europe (Zentropa)). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard, is shockingly outstanding as the American. He should have become a big movie star ?? at this age he reminds me a lot about Warren Beatty. The other main players are also good. Fuller's direction is quite good, with very long takes again (though they are not nearly as complicated as they were in Park Row; the long take more often than not consists of long scenes with a lot of dialogue). The only problems are in the script, as it seems to be the case with all the Fuller movies I've seen. It is not too bad a mistake, but it should have been extended, excursions large characters and parts of the script. Helga, wife, goes through a major change, but completely outside the screen. Therefore, the emotional center rests on Bests shoulders. Fuller should also have killed the sick mother early in the film. I hope it doesn't sound too hard! She just doesn't do anything in the whole movie, except lying in bed. She has so few lines. But Fuller continues to bring her up while the movie continues. I would have gotten his death to strengthen David and Helga's relationship himself. And the movie ends suddenly, and it lacks the payoff. These are not really the biggest mistakes in the world (the way I described them makes them sound bigger than they are). 10.9.
