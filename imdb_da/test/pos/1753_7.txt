Hoppity is a charming, if a little phycadelic animated film that was considered in 1941, has been a great time test. Now I have to admit that I have a soft spot for 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it is called in the UK) after seeing a VHS version lost by the TV by our parents many times with my siblings . Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning just in time to catch it on Channel Four (at 0615, never less!) The movie was as lovely as I remembered with the animation that stood the time test and a nice moral tale that would appeal to parents and children alike. Maybe one day I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a nice maturity for kids (88 Min) and a simple but involved storyline, there really is something for everyone in this story of the little guy who comes in well. I really could see that this was successfully restored in CGI. Take note Pixar.
