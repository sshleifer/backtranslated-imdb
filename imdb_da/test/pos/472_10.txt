I'm a nightmare movie director ... especially of mega buck, multiplex variety. Although I'm not an artist, I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buy into the vision of filmmakers if I can find it. Therefore, a gem like 'You Are Alone' is such an exciting find. Intimacy and pacing pulled me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuances and director Gorman Bechard shows a handful of presenting what is an understandable disruptive day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. <br /> <br /> Spoiler under <br /> <br /> I purchased the DVD version and have shared it with several people. The reactions have been varied from dissatisfaction in Daphne's ability to complete the task that Buddy has paid her to an inability to see the whole movie because it was just too genuine and emotionally devastating. As a compulsive skeptic film grille, I must either be gripped by the collars and drawn to the ride or sit up to and seduced by the film maker. This movie took me later, and in the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne's horror and pain on her role in Buddy's death. My reaction to this movie reminded me of seeing "Cook, the thief, his wife and her lover" by Peter Greenaway many many years ago. At the end, I was fascinated and repelled and totally incapable of tearing my eyes off that movie. I've watched this movie several times now and really appreciate the eye and ear that the instructor has demonstrated. I am familiar with other works he has made, including a few naughty films, 'Galactic Gigolo' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos' and a mixed bag 'The Kiss', which I recently learned was killed in the manufacturer's cradle and represents not really the director's vision. Too bad because I loved the two previous films and even found 'The Kiss' interesting, but the wish 'The Kiss' was available in a director's cut with all the original vision and music in tact. I look forward to the future work of this interesting director and managers Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
