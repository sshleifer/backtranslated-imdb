I've seen Love Jones over thirty times. It is one of the rare films depicting a love story about people who happen to be African Americans. The dialogue was written realistically and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a movie where the story was centered on young professional African Americans. This is largely an untapped market. Love Jones was also visually captivating. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present-day love. The feeling of the movie is jazz and blues, and brings to my senses a warm, creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you hadn't guessed, I loved it!
