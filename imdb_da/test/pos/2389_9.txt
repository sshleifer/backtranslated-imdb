I was at a friend's house for Thanksgiving and looked at a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen brothers) and was impressed by how good this movie is. My friend working at Magno Sound told us that this movie was shot at Super 16. The shooting was so good, it looked like it was a 35mm shooting. Furthermore, the music was combined with Fred Carpenter's direction of art. The story was original and led to an end that surprised us all to see ... very cool. The action of the whole cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was amazing. This movie was a great holiday treat, and I was happy to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
