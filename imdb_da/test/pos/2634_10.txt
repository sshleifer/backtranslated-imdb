Chris Penn is hilarious as an all-time stoner brother of Jeff Spicoli. This movie is great because it was much more real and fun than fast times on ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van tail, which became songs at ou812 and illegal carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner movie heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times were more depressing than fun. Abortion, friends cheating on friends, moving into bathrooms, bad jobs and missing school. Someone must hate in the eighties to suffer ridgemont more than the wild life. The film even had big cameos as the creator of the city limits Michelle shot in the wine shop or Ben Stein in his first role in the sun's profit store.
