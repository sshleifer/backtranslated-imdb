This is a sadly unrecognized classic. The look is great, the design, costumes, etc. Are flawless, the subsequent battle scenes and the cavalry are both cool and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are vibrant and truly human. Ardent is right, and Fabrice Luchini as lawyer Derville steals the film with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, gratifying in the ups and downs of others' accidents. Depardieu is good, but perhaps too big a presence for this role. <br /> <br /> Where the film really stands out is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novella. These changes are editorial because Balzac has lots of discussion about society, and this movie breathes signs. Nonetheless, Yves Angelo has retained the key element, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society, but every character has to find his place in society: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peerage his wife (Ardent) comes from. Low birth, and when she was married to Colonel Chabert, they achieved their position in the turbulence of the post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and it gives a good drama as their goals are in conflict with each other. It also feels very modern: money is crucial to buying the status of reaching power, but someone can go down as fast as they go up. Derville enjoys the strategy, he has seen the worst people he tells Chabert when he takes the matter. This speech is the original place at the end of the short story, when Balzac summarizes the human comedy with great irony.
