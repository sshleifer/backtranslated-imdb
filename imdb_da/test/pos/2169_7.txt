This movie will not be considered an academic prize, but if you enjoy a movie that does not take itself seriously and only wants the viewer to enjoy nineteen minutes, it is not a disappointment. You will enjoy a broadcast of Darth Vader for the villain (breath), a female Batman for the heroine (but much shorter with much smaller costume) and an ongoing joke involving cigarettes and the police chief who is very funny. Not in any way a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun, it was worth watching. God helps me, I liked it.
