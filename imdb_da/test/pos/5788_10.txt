I have the good common sense of knowing that oil cannot last forever, and I am very aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. I have been an avid consumer of new technology and I continue to run out of space on powerboards - so I know that even the energy war associated with Peak Oil will change my life noticeably. <br /> <br /> End of Suburbia shows in a rational and entertaining way how much my entire family's lifestyle changes in my life. I am particularly worried about future generations who will have to retrieve the table for our overrun, but the filmmakers give a glimpse of hope because they recognize human resource and determination - and the sense of society that tends to be created by common hardships. There is no point in trying to pretend that Peak Oil is baseless propaganda - or by treating it as the nearby radioactive cloud in "On The Beach" (ie with the suicide player in the clear). Even with our best efforts, times are getting harder everywhere, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity to walk around.
