Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human meat. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. The complex characters challenge superficial classification and make the story interesting and worthy - if you can keep it. Definitely a dark movie, but also a bit redemptive.
