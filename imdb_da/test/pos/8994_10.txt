I wanted to watch this movie ever since the preliminary studies came out. I don't understand why everyone is so hard on this movie. It cannot all be technically true to the sport of rugby, but this film is not primarily about the sport. It's about a rugby team that is taught to be more than the world's expectations for them. They are taught to become men, and not temporarily in vain boys. Hollywood is never 100% accurate in their productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something entertaining. The story of Coach Gelwix and what he has learned over the years is simply amazing. He learns about service, honor, integrity and moral cleanliness. How many other films does it teach to our youth these days? I was proud to see such a wonderful story that taught reverence and respect.
