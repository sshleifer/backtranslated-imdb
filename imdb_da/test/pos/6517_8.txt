This movie is centered on a young lady who asks to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think of other movies like "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong Catholic influence on the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as first, the Catholic school student and later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which is the name of the street I live on, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint's intercession when arising problems in her life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives with her. A local priest from me used to say that my sister looked like Ann Blyth, and both have the same first and middle names. A nice good family movie that came from an era, as life was a little more simple.
