I was really starting to enjoy this show. It started just slowly, and it didn't get the chance it deserved. It is summer time, so many people are not at home on television. I know there are a few talent and song competitions, but I enjoy them as many others. Believe it or not when American Idol is finished for that year, I miss it. Although this was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show as we really start to grow on me. I wish they would rethink and put the show back. I think it was a hasty step to cancel. My only complaint about the show was I didn't care for the judges.
