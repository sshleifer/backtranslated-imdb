1956's The Man, who knew too much, is outstanding entertainment. For those who prefer the 1934 original, I would say that one is faster and more sharp. But even though the American version was (heaven forbid!) A big budget blockbuster, I think it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best no smallfeed when he made over 50 movies, and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find so many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, America's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job for the worried father here. He can make any movie enjoyable, and he worked with such a sympathetic character in such a gripping story that he was very messy with him very intensively. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticism directed at her, I think she makes the loving wife / mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks on her character; Just because she is soft and gentle does not mean she is adequate and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but she makes a decisive discovery of herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first, and for those who care that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deserved of its Oscar. It raised the film to another level. 3) The Albert Hall sequence. I don't think it was too long at all; I think the excitement has been constantly building on the amazing crescendo, and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the murderer was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending really made a smile on my face; even after the above scene was over, I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. The last line of the movie is very entertaining. I don't think the movie started slowly; Hithcock tried to get us to know and like McKennas and he did a good job. I wasn't a big fan of the child playing Hank, but I had no problem with him. Since Hank was Ben and Jos's children, I cared about him too; It is not as if he was abrupt or anything. <br /> <br /> I didn't find any big flaws in this movie and so many big and small virtues. Way to go Hitch!
