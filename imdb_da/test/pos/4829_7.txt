'Wicked Little Things' really differs from other zombie films. First of all, all the zombies in the movie do not just start biting you and tearing your meat apart with their bare hands. They kill you with either a pickax or shovel and they eat you by department. Second, they cannot die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but these will simply not die. Third, which is the biggest reason why this movie is separate in itself is all the zombies children. How did they exactly die to become zombies? They worked in a coal mine when they were suddenly killed in a collapse. Now they wander the woods that carry their pickaxes and shovels and wait for someone to pass by to kill them and eat them. And they also come out at night.Yep, only at night. That makes the movie even more fun, so it would be if they came out in the morning. Despite all the violent and magical chaos in this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is a great choice if you are looking for a movie about zombie children. Don't expect anything big like "Dawn of the Dead" or "Dead of the Dead", but expect a lot of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser. Everyone gives Scout Taylor-Compton from Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' a big hand to deliver a fantastic performance like the one she did in 'Halloween'. She really has to start staring in several horror movies.
