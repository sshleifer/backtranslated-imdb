I'm sorry, but I just can't help what I love to see Iron Eagle. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a good movie. No, I guess I'll say this is an endless entertaining movie. For people who cut this movie into pieces so as not to be realistic, it certainly lacks the point. Of course, Iron Eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I think the target group was kids, and I remember finding this when I was a kid. Now I just find it fun as a guilty pleasure, like Road House. This film is part of the grand pantheon of the 80s, which captures children's entertainment and accepts the stodgy-adult power structures. You must remember D. A. R. Y.L., Real Genius, E.T. etc. If you ask me, just seeing Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" at the beginning is worth the price of the DVD. The whole sequence was so GREAT! But at the same time, it was fun, fun, quite 80, all the good things. So the bottom line is Iron Eagle a great 80-guilty pleasure. The hairstyles, the dance, the music, the dialogue, it's all fun as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was totally worth $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you love to laugh at dated, unrealistic action movies, this is a must-see. Oh yes, and I think its plot was only marginally stupid than the 1986 second fighter pilot action pic, Top Gun.
