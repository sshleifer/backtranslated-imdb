I thought this movie was fun. I have never really seen old movies before and this was a really good first date movie. It had warmth and heart and spirit. Was kind of cheesy, but in today's movie industry is cheesy sweet. I gave it a ten and I suggest a lot to rent, buy or watch the movie anyway you can. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic and you knew the sign that he would get it all. The female lead was thrown perfectly because their two personalities had spark, and you wanted to stick and see what would happen. Grandma in the movie was invaluable. The perfect addition to a great old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white, and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help him. See it.
