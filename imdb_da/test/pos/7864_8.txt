Combining the conventions of both Western and Gothic horror, and often aimed at being an art film, this is one of Siegel and Eastwood's best collaborations. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, takes refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women. Shut away from the world, the women project their romantic fantasies on him, and he reacts with cold, male manipulation. But jealousy and anger raise their heads, and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy is revenge brutal. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees, and carefully paced, "The Beguiled" is a thrilling, elegant work that apparently has affected Eastwood's own worried "Play Misty for Me" and "Tightrope". <br /> <br /> The film is a poignant portrayal of a fierce gender struggle and radiates a dreamless mix of horror and sexuality. All the characters are ambiguous and show traits of both good and evil, and this allows us to choose who to turn to. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left some legacy of fine films behind. Everything from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry". But even though his early black and white pictures have been good, the majority of his color films appear to be grainy, dated and badly shot. His cruel "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when you look today, I just don't think they have been the time test. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" is in another league. Elderly, ambiguous and heavily shot, it's a shame it is no longer known. While the development of technology and technology has made the majority of Siegel's tough, masculine action thrillers obsolete, "The Beguiled" still enters the audience today because of it's surreal atmosphere and unique subject. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the corresponding theme "Black Narcissus", this is, in my opinion, Siegel's best movie. Share horror, drama, sexual odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly arty movie (especially when considering Siegel watching his films be quotes, meaningless). Much of the film's artwork is due to Clint Eastwood, who from that time on would make an effort to select mature material.
