It's a deep silly humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this movie. Bérénice Béjo is sweet. It makes fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. I've already seen it three times and I still want to see it again. Buy the DVD as soon as possible. You will not regret it. It's the kind of movie where you don't have to have a good scenario because it's a parody. The only fault is that OSS 117 is too short. It's a jewel. It is not very common to see a French movie succeed in the United States, but I think this one has everything to succeed. Trust me!!!
