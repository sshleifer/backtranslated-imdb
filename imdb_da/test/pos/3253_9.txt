Two Hands is an extremely enjoyable Aussie crime caper that ultimately succeeds in the way the movie easily combines tense dramatic moments with very fun characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs have not been created too extensively and have not been for the work. It's really great fun, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellent cast and that every actor / actress recognizes and can relate to Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically. Of course, they are tremendously helped with a fantastic script by author / director Gregor Jordan. I read another review of this movie by an American who had seen it, and he strongly criticized it as he essentially left it as a Pulp Fiction clone. I think it's just a nonsense. This film does not attempt to be Pulp Fiction, and the feeling and style of each of these excellent films is quite the opposite. Without sounding superior or arrogant, I fully understand this movie; humor, sincerity, character, etc .... you must be Australian or at least understand the culture that the other guy of course did not have the weakest idea. Some Americans, whose reviews of certain non-American films, seem unaware that (and have trouble understanding) something that is not a US product. It's a shame because it's a really good movie. The love story between the protagonist and the girl is also portrayed in a very genuine, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
