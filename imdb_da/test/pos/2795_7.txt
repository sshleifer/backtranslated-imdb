** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> It is really unfortunate that such a well-produced movie turns out to be a disappointment. I thought it was filled with (stupid) clichés and <br /> <br /> basically trying hard. <br /> <br /> To the (American) boys out there: how many of you are using your <br /> <br /> time to jump on your boyfriend's bed and make monkey <br /> <br /> sounds ? To the (married) girls: How many of you have suddenly gone from boobs to nymphos overnight - but not to your <br /> <br /> husband? To the French: Do you really want to ask someone <br /> <br /> to be "à la fac" when you know they are not speaking French? Wouldn't you <br /> <br /> use a more common word like "université"? <br /> <br /> For some time I lived in France and I know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it) but my (German) roommate and I found this <br /> quite insulting parent. It looked like a movie funded by <br /> <br /> the European Parliament, and it was too much to try. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing in itself <br /> <br />), but the result is at best awkward, but actually ridiculous - also <br /> <br /> many clashes that would not happen. So the end of the <br /> <br /> movie - the last 10 minutes - destroyed the rest. Why doesn't Xavier speak <br /> <br /> with the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? Why is he just going away? Why does he just run away from his job, is it <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And finally, the new Europe should rest on <br /> <br /> a bunch of people smoking and shagging all day? Is that what it <br /> <br /> is made of? <br /> <br /> In addition, the play was quite terrible. I can't believe Judith <br /> <br /> Godrèche's role and play. Why was she made to look like Emanuelle Béart so much? At first I thought Xavier was OK, but <br /> <br /> with retrospect I think he was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And that's all too bad, too technical (opening credits, scenes when he asks what papers he needs) it was really good (except audio editing around the British siblings), and <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also amazing. So the form was good, but the content was pretty terrible.
