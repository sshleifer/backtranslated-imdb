This first (and hopefully not the last) Wallace & Gromit feature meets expectations. There are lots of jokes (some a little cheeky) as well as some great tribute to former Science Fiction movies. With the barrage of horrible and formal movies being spewed from Hollywood, it's great to see such a great movie like this one that is fun for almost everyone. If there is any justice, it will be the top of the cashier's office and be at least nominated for best animation on the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; The characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are fun. This is one of the movies that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, smart, fun and well made, what can't you enjoy?
