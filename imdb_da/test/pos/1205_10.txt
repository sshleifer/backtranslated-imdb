Now more than ever, we need peace and love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie really shows the amazing music from the Broadway show and the amazing choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years and it still keeps well. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA for putting this on DVD! I love the opportunity to watch widescreen. MGM cuts to do this on many of their DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You must love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They could not have chosen better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is such a "hot mama" in this movie - I had forgotten just as hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> The support molding is absolutely fantastic, <br /> <br /> with the late big Nell Carter, who makes a song bowl in a couple of scenes, as well as the cooked Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett on 'Facts about life ') The story is a little weak towards the end, but the anti-war content at the end of the 60s still holds up and is relevant today. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed (quite a bit on the spot) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings back the spirit of 1968 on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15 and was moved by then and it still moves on 40. Some other reviews on here say they mean that it should have been done before - I don't think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60s-early 70s. The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and it all came a little too close to home, I think this story should be filmed before it was (as in 1969, 70, 71) <br /> <br /> Bravo to Director Milos Foreman ! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
