Raoul Walsh's mega-epic, anesthetic recorded in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie way, but this classic car journey across America to NorthWest is exciting as a pure physical production when it seen on the big screen. On TV. the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction can be daunting. Young John Wayne easily scores in his first lead with a natural delivery, the rest of the cast can't command. Surprisingly, the movie flew, and Wayne spent most of the following decade in Class B vest food.
