I have to say it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Dommer has an eye on things that no one would ever notice in Office Space. Hemager's statement of the dumbing down of society and that the survivor of the most full is just pipe dream for 500 years. The pop culture and mass marketing of wealthy companies tend to rule the day. Yes, there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is getting the story moving and his point across. But the real frustration of Private Joe Bower's face is invaluable, and in some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you don't enjoy humor, look at it from a different point of view and see it again. It took me to see it twice to really appreciate this movie for what it is ?? And having said that after seeing it twice? I need to read a book now.
