I hope, from his seat on the heavenly comic throne, that Spike Milligan can watch and enjoy this movie when Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said to write it "almost transformed me crazy" into a joy to see. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish city of Puckoon, and the problems are related to it when the divider between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drafted, cuts through the center of the village and more worryingly through the center of the cemetery. This means that some deceased, buried in the Catholic cemetery, are now in the Protestant North - and then the local priest, assisted by a wide range of eccentric locals, is seeking to move the body back in the dark and thus avoid the bureaucratic British border guards. <br /> <br /> It was inspired to throw Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play Madigan. He brings innocence to the part, especially in his two-camera pieces (which is usually where he interacts with Richard Attenborough's voice transfer, probably plays the author / director of the movie). Daragh O'Malley plays Far Rudden is also worthy of great praise; and the rest of the cast, from household names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people who would normally be called "bit parts" - like Spike's daughter Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, gives 100% The credit for this goes in a small part, to the wonderful characteristics that Spike gave in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could argue that the movie is a bit too long, or Elliott Gould's Irish accent left a little to be desired, but they would only be minor points and not take away from this film's expertise.
