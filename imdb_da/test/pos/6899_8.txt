I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and liked it very much. It worked for me as a little strange comedy, because I don't like horror, but there were only a few minutes I had to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, costumes and settings were not far from BBC quality, which is great for an indie movie. I liked the way the plot twists and even bucks, it surprised me in good ways. I was even warmed to the Willy Grimes character, which I didn't like much at first. It would have been better if there had been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island. It felt very much like a plot unit. <br /> <br /> I love Dominic Monaghan, and he did a great job at pratfalls, horror, and the more thoughtful moments. Nice voice in the story too. <br /> <br /> This would be a fun and unusual date movie.
