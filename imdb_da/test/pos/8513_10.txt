Let me deviate from many comments I have read here and say that this film ranks as one of the five best bindings with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, from Russia with love, license to kill and only for your eyes ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls it all together - as co-author, co-producer and in his best performance since From Russia with love. He is well suited, energetic and of course enjoys himself. His plays are mature, confident and twisted with the right amount of humor. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleep goes through You Only Live Twice, and his jowly paunchy penetrates the cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever! This is an imaginative rework of Thunderball, without putting and machines overwhelmingly character and plot. This cast is also much better. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to the role of Largo without relying on an eyelid, SPECTER ring or a dull uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and for once we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling Small-Fawcett is fun without falling into slapstick. Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his sites (Bahamas and French Riviera) without losing his actors. Though close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, the Kershner keeps the movie moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Of course, fans will miss the gun barrel brand and the 007 theme music, but they belong to Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the sites without being too intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments are in southern France, where his French love song (at spa) is extremely attractive. And tell me how many people really remember the music of Moonraker? I would personally rather forget Man with the Golden Gun and a picture for a kill! The Eon people can sneak this movie if they like it. (Yeah, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 did not swing through the jungle that shed a Tarzan scream. He did not release a bengal tiger, nor did he beat "Indian" snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and late Jack Schwartzman put a fine movie, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to see James Bond get kicked in the rails with a dwarf, engage in another tiring fight with "jaws", jump to bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chasing San Francisco, this is NOT the movie for you!
