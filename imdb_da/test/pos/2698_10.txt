Here in Germany, "King of Queens" has a great great cult status! Almost all teenagers (and adults) look at this sitcom. It is truly amazing !! Better than the other horrible American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set for Step" (the only series that is still OK is "Al Bundy"). There has not been an Amercian sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really fun show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller, as Arthur is the funniest "grandfather" I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are the most diverse, but funny guys i know. I see it as often as I could and I still don't have enough good humor!
