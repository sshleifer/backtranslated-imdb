Well, the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of times. In that sense, the film is actually dated. But as a satirical look at America's number one parasitic industry, advertising, it's still on target. But equally important is the countermeasure, namely the effect of big money on those who would make the industry more socially responsible, not promoting war toys, alcohol, etc. Thus, the film also deals with the attractions of capitalism. Note, for example, how Putney's garb suddenly changes to resemble the third-world revolutionary Fidel just before he withdraws from the company. For a moment, it appears that Swopes mini-revolution has succeeded among his employees, and he continues, perhaps to spread the movement. But then the former militants bow to the big money, and he diverges to shake his head, perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba. However, Downey's last word is an ironic, as the Arab (I think) burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of (advertising, capitalism) a smoking ruin. For me, does it seem that change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a reform process? A message consistent with the radical spirit of time. Regardless of the subtitles, there are some really fun moments, especially with the advertisements that play as well as they did then. Those who compare the anarchist style with the Marx Bros' messages make a good point. The cast lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous layouts. Forty years later, it's still a hard movie to get a uniform handle on. In spite of the cruelty, however, the film remains a work of bold originality with some really narrative moments.
