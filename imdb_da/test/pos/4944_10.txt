Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series all the time. And SCIII is my favorite in the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much greater improvement over the chopped polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the breeze, and they flash themselves. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting plots and characters, and SCIII is no exception. Each character has its background story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She is cute, she is fun and she is a strong female character. Yes, I know she has pink and has a boyfriend (whom she ends up saving VAT), but there seems to be more to her than that. Xianghua, like all the other characters, has errors and upsides to their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good ones. <br /> <br /> The music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series. It doesn't sound kitchy (the Vampire series), nor does it sound like an old school porn movie soundtrack (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes, and many of the themes are made to match the culture of that particular part of the world. I don't think there's a song on this soundtrack I don't like. Another fun thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create a Soul). You can make him look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like it. But if you found a character fit that you like, remember to take notes, otherwise you can't remember how to create that character. I found myself very dependent on CaS. All in all, I think Soul Calibur is my first match series all the time. It has everything I asked for. What more can I have?
