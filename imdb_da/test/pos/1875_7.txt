It has really been a long time since the last time that a movie is made as such. A so-called B-movie. Maybe it wasn't a good movie, but it's fun to see, classic Bruce Cambell, it has its good parts, fun ones, obnoxious, even artistic. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> The part where his wife as a dummy robot avenger is dying, I don't know about you, but it made me feel so weird, so sad and disgusted in a good way. I compare this scene with the scene from Fly 2, where his dog as a monster dies. Make you think of my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> ******** No more Spoilers ****** *** <br /> <br /> If you are a Bruce Cambell fan, you will definitely have this movie in your collection. If you are generally interested in movies, you may want to. Just think that the film's goal is to make you smile, break you out (don't worry so badly) and make yourself comfortable with your friends. Note, I said friends, not possible future girlfriend.
