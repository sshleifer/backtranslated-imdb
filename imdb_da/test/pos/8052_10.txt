I am from Phoenix City and the first time I saw this movie and read the book, it only confirmed the stories I had heard throughout my life. I asked my grandfather about the mob, and he told me that when he came back from fighting in the Pacific Ocean, he started a CPA company known as the largest in the Columbus area. When he just started, he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them, but he said he was gently falling. Even when the FBI and the army came through Phoenix City and cleaned it, my grandfather would not take it easy when my mother, aunt or uncle crossed the river, but I assure you all that is over now. The downtown area of ​​Phoenix City needs restoration, and it has slums at the courtyard where all the sliders are still over angry, uneducated, low socioeconomic people, and the 14th Street Phoenix Eagle Bridge has been shut down for a fixed 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge, but on the fairer side of Phoenix City on Summerville Rd. it is very quaint and the scenery depressing. <br /> <br /> Another incident was told to me by my best friend's family from high school living in no place on Hwy 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 minutes outside Columbus, Ga. my best friend in high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. No matter how the movie goes, the fact that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about him in the original book. The legend has it that he was so cold blood that he went to downtown Phoenix City to make an appointment with a man, but apparently the man supported the deal right in front of Old Man Davis, so the old man Davis continued to take a sawn shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of the city at the courtyard. they say that he himself bypassed because the mob had paid all police officers in town so he had nothing to worry about. Another incident is about a bridge that another of my friends owns a rental house next door in downtown Phoenix City. It is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man out of, and you can even read that part in the book. I would also like to be asked as extra material in the film as in many Columbus and phoenix city civilians. When the patterson's friend is murdered and brought before the judge and the evidence is guilty of the judge, but still free, well, the judge is my father's partner in his columbus law firm, who unfortunately is deceased.
