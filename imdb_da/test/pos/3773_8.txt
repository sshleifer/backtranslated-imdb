So it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 years old. Amazingly, I have this on BETA tape and it still plays fine. If it came to DVD, I would catch it up in the heart. <br /> <br /> The drug problem is not appreciated today as it was then. Then it was not so 'harmful'. Much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember my dad crying, he laughed so hard to see it here. I had colleagues in the 90s who had seen it and I could bust them up by entering the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Big lines, great spoof of the original and fun for me anyway even three decades later!
