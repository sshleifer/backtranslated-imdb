Remember that college friend who always insisted on renting the weirdest movie possible? This is the movie he would have made if he had the chance. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you exactly what the Sea of ​​Dust was about. It pretends to be the story of a doctor who is sucked into strange puzzles in the "Black Forest." He goes there to help but ends up being caught between two young women, both of whom he seems to have something for. But it just scrapes the surface. This is the kind of movie where things just happen randomly ... and not nice. People are constantly whipped and stacked. There are a few scary little girls who seem to have gone out of The Shining. Tom Savini is a kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he will no longer be imaginary. He has a plan to take over the world by sharing Jesus' suffering. <br /> <br /> At some level this is a movie about sex. It is a no-nonsense, which was a disappointment, but there is no fault in the intention. On another whole level it is a stoner's paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that it stops being unexpected. When the doctor travels through her boyfriend's birth canal to be reborn, you will just criticize it for the girl's crazy nature. <br /> <br /> On the downside, the movie is pretty decent. Some of the points hammered home again and again. If you see it with a bunch of rocky friends, it can turn out to be an asset.
