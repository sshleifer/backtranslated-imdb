I remember many years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut shape. I tracked it on video a couple of years ago and saw it again. The movie though slow and a bit strange (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was honestly effective. It is one of my favorite slasher movies, and I have no idea where an unknown version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the US where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you can't get this movie as it was supposed to be seen. Wrong turn (the recent Stan Winston produced movies) owes a lot to Just Before Dawn. One of the better 80's slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
