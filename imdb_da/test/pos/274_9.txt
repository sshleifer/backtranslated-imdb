The Stepford kids are the second-best Stepford movie in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford wives in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was absolutely blown away, it was great. I've seen all the Stepford movies and I like them all. I think The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movie. I just saw it again recently on tape, and I enjoyed it immensely. The cast in this movie was really good to see. Barbara Eden did a puzzle as usual. Every role she has ever played has been very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and caring type of person. Murray as husband and father was just perfect in this movie. He was particularly effective at being the annoyed father of his two teenage children. I made sure I got all the Stepford movies on tape to enjoy. If you get a chance to watch this movie, you need to.
