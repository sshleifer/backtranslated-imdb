It doesn't matter if you've experienced the situation of the elderly in America, or if you're just unclear then Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg give you that fact in a straight forward, fun, wake up and smell the roses kind of way. At the end of the movie, it is obvious that while you are completely entertained, you have also been trained. A fantastic movie, with a fantastic up and coming talent in the film field.
