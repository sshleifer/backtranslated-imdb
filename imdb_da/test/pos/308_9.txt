Well, I've been watching this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is certainly one of the most unique movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think Martin Sheen got "dissed" great time in billing too. He dominates the movie, but receives less billing than Marlon Brando, which only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2-hour, 17-minute movie (theater version). How unfair is that? Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his story, which runs all the way through. It's one of the best stories, if not the best, I've ever heard in a movie. His voice is just joking when he tells his thoughts about this incredible nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie. The second thing that strikes me about the movie over the years is the number of memorable scenes that I have never forgotten, such as .... <br /> <br /> Sheen loses it in his hotel room in the film's first scene; Robert Duvall and the all-out surfing scenes and then the subsequent attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining troops; Frederic Forrest is freaked out and sees a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat trip; The appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greets the crew of Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes over and over with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That's not to say, I enjoyed everything. No, there are a couple of very unpleasant scenes, like the one where a bull is cut in half (can't see it any more), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheens Young's punched crew and the crew is a bit foggy at times . Then there is the huge amount of fate which, incidentally, is led for many f-words. <br /> <br /> There are many good and many bad things in this movie for almost everyone who sees this One thing for sure: it's a movie you want to remember!
