Following his former movie "Videodrome", which definitely shows similarities to this movie, David Cronenberg reigns in the world of virtual reality where truth and fiction are mixed. It is the virtual reality taken at a completely different level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is an extremely original film that is well-tended and acted out, but above all very well-written. The film has a fascinating and well-thought-out concept that is very much done by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that constantly fools you. Just as you thought you expected things, another surprise awaits you around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You just never really know what's reality, and what's the game world right up to the end. It makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also gives the film a great ending that makes you think even more. The film has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its marvelous events. They must complete a particular step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism without ever going over-the-top with either. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, even though the film is not always so easy to follow due to its events, dialogues and unusual surroundings. The movie is not just strange. I was actually surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here, thought it is a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The movie is also still entertaining and has a good fast pace. It never allows the film to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly visible to people who normally do not see this kind of movie. The movie looks great, with subtle effective special effects a good visual look that also gives the movie a certain required "gaming" feel. The movie is well thrown, with Jude Law in a role that you do not often see him in that a shy insecure person. It shows once again how actual versatile act as an actor is and that he is more than just another beautiful face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female manager. She hasn't really played so many big parts in big productions, but with this film she shows why she has always been considered a great movie star anyway. The film also includes some other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original movie worth watching, especially if you have previously seen "Videodrome". <br /> <br /> 8/10
