There is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says that can summarize the whole movie: "In Italy, it is the dead who rule". Right! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and naughty men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country revolved around the seemingly meaningless story of a director filming marriage feasts to serve for life, to say much about what doesn't work here. But foreigners may miss the point, as it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people who are looking at this may be bored and wondering if there is meaning - that is a meaning, but it is only clear to people who live here today and keep their eyes open ... like Bellocchio. It is certainly not one of his best films, and it is not as powerful as Buongiorno, but it is worth seeing ... for Italians living in Italy.
