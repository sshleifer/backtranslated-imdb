Why not put this amazing movie on DVD, I have been searching like the previous author for years, what is the team up or showing it on TV. It's so underestimated that it's one of the most romantic and beautifully written books I've ever read, and I think I've read some. I think it was read on radio 4, but I can't find it either. Why not try to re-introduce it yourself, I promise it will be top-notch, people love these kinds of stories. So please release it and take us out of our misery or reuse it, even if I doubt it could be improved. Have anyone read to the ground of the same author or seen the movie with Jennifer Jones, it's great, but not to the same extent it can be.
