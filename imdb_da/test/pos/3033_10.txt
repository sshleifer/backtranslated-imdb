Outstanding story of a dedicated young teacher describing the teaching of minority children in an area outside South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is as enormous as the haughty, dedicated, idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal who believes in rigorous discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent, played with relish of late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the most important one who loves her babies. <br /> <br /> As I am a retired teacher, I could in some ways relate to this excellent movie. The ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite obvious in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these kids need far more than the traditional lessons in a classroom. He has them going out to experience life by learning outdoors. The end is a concrete downer, but so true in life. <br /> <br /> Amazing that such back students had a zest to learn and were well-disciplined. I guess it answers my question. The construction was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their surroundings. The end will just draw on your heart. It was memorable and so good poignant.
