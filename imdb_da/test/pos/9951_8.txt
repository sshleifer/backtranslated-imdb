What can I say? The little child inside has always had great feelings for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a tile, megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all points. As an adult, it is easy to point out the many flaws in this movie and to say hello it really is just a bunch of episodes taken from a children's television series stretched together. Despite all this, I find the end very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. Outstanding fun if it is a little indecent at times.
