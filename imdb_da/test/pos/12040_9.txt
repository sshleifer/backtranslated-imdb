Darr, though a copy of some Hollywood flicks, is one of the best movies I've seen. It is not only beautifully depicted, but also has good songs and beautiful scenes. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expression and voice fit his character. I was pleasantly surprised by Sunny Deol's depiction in the movie. He is a little romantic and lovable in the movie, unlike his other characters in his other films. At times, it feels like Justice has not been done to his character. Sunny was supposed to be portrayed as the good guy in the movie, but end up looking like the villain at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is her usual self. In short, a great love story of passion.
