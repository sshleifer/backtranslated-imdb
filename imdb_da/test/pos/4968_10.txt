The movie Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is film noir magnificence.This is a most unknown movie that all movie noir fans should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time, making the movie a surrealistic quality at times. I love the strong black and white film noir movies.Film noir in color is not that good. Cast and script are excellent. The slightly eerie music is fun to listen to. Ida Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses for everlasting grace screen. I have never seen a production that she was in that I did not like. She was not only breathtakingly beautiful, she was a fine actress. The first movie I remember watching Ida Lupino in was Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde I never forgot the movie or her. I saw her last movie as Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains, and although the movies were not her usual fare, she was still delighted with them as an actress. Howard Duff is always great to see. I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone. I have this movie on VHS tape.
