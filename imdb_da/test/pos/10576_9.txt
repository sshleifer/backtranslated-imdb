I'm usually disappointed with what the media dubbed "lesbian" movies these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women but end up with men in the end; ridiculously beautiful women who only get each other to beat men etc. Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal over this garbage. It is a credible love story that was performed by every cast member, MARVELOUSLY, at least by the supporting actors. Apart from having a very engaging central conflict, the romance between the heroes is well-developed and credible thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I've also seen TIPPING THE VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is far better than the former, both in character / conflict development and the quality of the actor. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and comfortable to see and offers lesbians everywhere a great follow-up act to BOUND.
