I rarely see short films, as they only look at night television and are not published enough to know which short films are worth. Since The Room is an extra feature on The Hitcher DVD, it gave me a great opportunity to witness a high quality card with Rutger Hauer in excellent shape. <br/> <br /> Artistic shot in black and white explores The Room a man's occupation with a room, he passed in the early stages of adulthood and expressed in a documentary / interview style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but is also beside ramblings and occasionally lacking in fluency. This adds great realism and depth to Hauer's performance, which is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. The piano music, which Harry (Hauer) hears from space, is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feeling of sadness spoken by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood slam with this role and shows perfectly his more sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in flashback scenes like young Harry with a quiet role. He shows how influenced he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away. The ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many movie lengths. A very good effort.
