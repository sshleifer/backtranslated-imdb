I absolutely think it is. The scripture is of such a quality that English language beginner students will model their conversations after the dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more on this character later) is very clear and to the point: Mrs. Davis says, "I hope you like chicken. That's the only thing I know how to make "as Kersey reacts with," Chicken is good. I like chicken. "If it's not English grammar 101, I don't know what's. Another thing about this Mrs. Davis sign: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws himself at him and tells him she wants to see him "one last time" (this is only the fourth time they ever have met) before moving to her sister's house in Binghamton, NY to get away from the creeps; then he doesn't even taste, while her body burns on the street just minutes later. Kersey never even says his first name throughout the film. Not even. Never a "Come here, Katy" or "It's a lovely dress you're wearing, Kathryn" or a "Beware, Katie or creeps'll get you!" And while this 'love' evolves between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his eternally watched eyes on them. It's almost as if Kersey is using her as a bait to get to Fraker, much as he uses the camera or car. Certainly, when Fraker bites, Kersey binds hard back ... in the most incredible series of events ever captured on film! The last fifteen minutes may be rivaled only by the last thirty minutes of the Delta Force in their luster. And that gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie can you see that Ed Lauter takes out Alex Winter to make Charles Bronson's back seem to call a hotline to call neo-Nazi cyclists to come to his aid, and nimble Broadway dancers wearing mesh halter tops make up as street punks, all shut down for a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If it is not the highest of high comedy, then there is no fun. <br /> <br /> Truly, there are a thousand ways to tell about the accidental comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to see it and judge for yourself.
