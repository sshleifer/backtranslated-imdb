This movie often appears on premium cable channels and I find that I watch it over and over again. The performances are wonderful and the material has so much to do that there is always something new to take away from the film. Maybe I'm too often distracted when you watch movies at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends under the credits. But this film is about people, and what motivates us what forgives us, what causes cracks between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie like The Love Letter makes me take a chance on new movies. Frankly, I am surprised that the film is not better known. I would like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many more roles. They are a pleasure to see. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no previous idea that she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than just being the comic relief. <br /> <br /> This movie provides interesting images as a proper backdrop for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to see it.
