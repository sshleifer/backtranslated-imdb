What can I say about this movie that doesn't give you any predictions when you see it? Very small. The reason has to do with returning from hospital to a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows is the movie. It is one of the most horrific films of the past few years. Everything about the movie is just a little central and leaves you feeling sick when the movie is finished. It's not a perfect movie. The film has problems in its last half hour, which makes an already confusing story even more confused. (If you've read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, you'll know that a lot of time has been spent trying to unlock what's actually going on) I'm not sure what I actually think of this movie beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that the most famous horror movies ever have. If you like horror and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up, I suggest you try this as it will more likely make your skin crawl.
