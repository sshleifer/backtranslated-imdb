I blame even a person's birth - to begin the long-standing tradition of history's Hollywood travesties, of which there may be few larger examples than this. Except for the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and Sioux and President Grant spelled right, geography was correct and the fact that Custer and his men were actually wiped out for a man, the rest just takes at all and the invention to ridiculous limits. Throw in some fair hackneyed scenes of the purest exhibition, (try Custer and his wife learning the fake "Gold Rush" to apologize for the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony in front of Congress invoked the rights of the Red Indians and to the top of it all , Custer storms into the president's office to ask to return to his post), frankly, there is much more of the same, some of these scenes are almost comical in their grains ... And yet it's still a Great action with Flynn as dangerous as DeHavilland as an insult as ever, young Anthony Quinn begins as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as childhood as always in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe in legends before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a successful, wonderfully fun classic Hollywood movie there!
