Having seen Grindhouse recently, I searched in the Video USA for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theaters in downtown areas of the 70s. Hong Kong's action girl Five Fingers of Death just seemed like a picture. Cartoon-like sound effects and quick cuts seemed a bit distracting at first, but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters I didn't care about. Parts of the music scored as "Ironside" the TV theme song, which was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movie. Some scenes involving the hero's fianc√© seemed to hit the limit of parody, but they were so short that they did not destroy the movie. The most exciting parts involve the tournament and some raising segments after that. Well worth seeing for kung fu fans!
