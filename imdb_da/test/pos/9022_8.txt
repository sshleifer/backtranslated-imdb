I love this movie. I just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so my sister could see it. This movie is so funny. There are two times that I laugh so hard that my pages hurt. I didn't expect to see a movie so funny; I really just wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I first saw her in Titus, who is also a great movie. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers have said, many people expect a profound movie. You're not gonna get it. What you want is humor, eye care, and the ability to ask yourself exactly what your perfect buddy would look like if you could create them. You can also wonder how it would be to get stuck in the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious order implies that Justine first sees himself as a naked man. I blew up. <br /> <br /> I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen, and that's my favorite now. <br /> <br /> Just remember why movies were originally created; as entertainment does not philosophy go on. Remember this and you will have a good time looking at Virtual Sexuality.
