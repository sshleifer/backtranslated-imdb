I gave this a 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old-fashioned movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and both were good of their type ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more boobs in this movie than one could imagine for an R-rated movie. From the beginning to the end they just seem to be shown on the screen (sunbathing scenes, bedroom scenes and of course the climatic football game). Also a memorable kissing house (kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to be good at their roles (more Playboy Playmates, Danny Bonaduce, several well-known TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa London's character is her last name "O'Hara" and not a good 1970's name like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!) . I saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (pretty well equipped himself) and she couldn't believe I really enjoyed the movie !! She was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... just don't think too hard!
