Art imitates life imitating art. Atticus Finch reincarnated in D.A. in this tragic and exciting gripping documentary that plays more like who-did-it and how it happened. The authenticity of the personality and sometimes reluctant honesty make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes, there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity and the fight against grief that have drawn me back to see and review this movie over and over again. The music is running but not intrusive; Pacing and visuals are such that there are no mistakes that these are real people who undergo an authentic experience.
