For those of you still in the dark I will not spoil this Christie, as it is certainly one of her finest works, and I emphasize that you should see it when you next have free time! If any of the adaptations are to be monitored before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to praise the priest of Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist) whose employer friend Cora was brutally murdered at the beginning of the movie. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman actually moves, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person traveling alone in the "journey of life". And when the killer is revealed in the typical Poirot denouement fashion, Dolan's reactions to the revelation seem to be at its extreme: you feel so angry at the killer as you are sympathetic to Miss Gilchrist ... something uncommon in Christie Lore. <Br /> <br /> Although there are a few discrepancies between novel and film adaptation as it usually is (the will of the will may make less sense in the movie), the incredibly lavish recreation of post-war England, the thoroughly high caliber of action and control and preservation (if not elevation) of Christie's mystery and intrigue make these inconsistencies insignificant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team to make this masterpiece of murder mystery theater, and the manufacturers who gave it the green light! Encore!
