I've seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer and really didn't start to love the show until Season 4 started. This episode "Hush" was seen alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing violently after a storm. The authors of this episode did an excellent job that scared the heel out of me. I was in awe of the entire episode, which I just finished 2 minutes ago. Great does not touch the surface of what this episode does with almost no dialogue. If you have never given this show much thought, at least see this episode. If this doesn't impress you then it won't be an episode. <br /> <br /> BTW My Heart is still running ...
