I think I was recommended this movie by the lady in the shop, I rented it from! For once she was scared! What a great movie! First of all, I was convinced that James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish, so convincing were their accents; and halfway through the movie I was absolutely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and certainly James McAvoy was too! When I saw the special features of the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' cover, saying I was blown away, it would be an understatement !!! I remember all the recognition Dustin Hoffmann came back in the 80s for his portrayal of autism in the movie 'Rain Man' - frankly (in my opinion of course!) Steven Robertson's performance / portrayal blows Dustin Hoffmann straight out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such !! All in all, one of the greatest depictions of human friendship / love / relationships is ever - and it was made in the UK / Ireland with home-culture actors - keep it in your tube and smoke it Hollywood!
