When I watched this movie, it reminded me of all the greatest dreams I had (mostly filled with robots) <br /> <br /> I can relate to Eidelore's problems and I have a similarity to Shiro and that is a good movie to watch (if you are a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, see it before it's out of print!
