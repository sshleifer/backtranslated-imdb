Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented woman teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public and bitter to her students. She sees violence and frustration privately, and her sexual life is lonely and perverted. She lives with her indulgent mother, who obsessively drives her to be noticed (and so forth in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the signs of both mother and daughter is 'obsession'. These signs cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlamps can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets with a young, attractive, talented pianist who is attracted to her from the beginning. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the beginning, she makes perverse and violent conditions that he must perform on her, enough to sing him to end the relationship before it really begins. <br /> <br /> The film binds to the woman's leadership. Isabelle Huppert astounds with a brutal, totally convincing performance as the piano teacher. She wisely shows a woman who is attracted to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses. As a movie that is so character-driven, you know it wouldn't work half as well if she had acted badly. <br /> <br /> This is powerful, intelligent act, and intelligent and sensitive to the storyline. The camera's work also fits the movie. There is what I can only think of calling, framing shots where the instructor holds a scene and forces the eye to kill. This is made extremely effective against an empty bathroom wall and is an additional testament to the director's mastery. Expect to be disturbed by this movie. But be brave - have the courage to go and see it. This is a very private look at essentially a person's life, but don't expect to be entertained in Hollywood sans .... there are no bills in this movie!
