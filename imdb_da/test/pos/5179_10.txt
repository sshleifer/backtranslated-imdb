Seeing Gary Busey in a G-rated movie was a first and a good one on it. I don't know much about the director, but of course he knows how to spend a few dollars and make the most of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember that Christopher Atkins did was Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to watch this movie and put him to work. Wife thinks he's very sweet. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. What we liked most was the message that this movie broadcasts. Greed sucks and believes, love and family win! This is the first low-budget DVD we've bought that had so many things on it. The producers did this for children and the kids loved it. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably won't stick to family movies, but I hope he does - because he really knows how to make the most of kids, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey act like a dog was even more fun. There wasn't much we didn't like about this one. It was hard to find a family movie without all the red humor, and Quigley was a nice surprise.
