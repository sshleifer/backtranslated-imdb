I've rented this gem several times! It is a small yet scattered masterpiece that takes the viewer from Manhattan glitz to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavete's on-screen marriage with his real wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He finds meaning in a fling with footloose Susan Sarandon, which he finds in Greece, while their daughter, who played in her earliest movie role of pubescent Molly Ringwald, falls to the son of the Greek master who pours her mother on a yacht that sail into nearby waters. Meanwhile, the extremely talented Raul Julia plays a goatherd who lives in a hole with his Sony Trinitron. He has "hots" to Molly Ringwald's character until he is confronted by John Cassavetes. Everything comes together at the end in a classically closed scene where everything is united. Raul Julia, goatherd, is seen with the dance with her goat. This movie is full of mystery, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexiness and much more. See it!
