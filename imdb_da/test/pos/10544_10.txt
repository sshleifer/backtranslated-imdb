Initially, it looks like the current romance film, where a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the intention is that this movie has a feeling that others do not have. The first time I saw it, I couldn't see it completely because I had to go. But while I was walking together, I thought I should see it again, but I had no option then. One year passed, until I saw this movie in a non-free channel, and I saw it and I recorded it too. I saw it once twice ... until 200 times and not fun. I knew all the dialogues of hart and I don't know why, but I saw it every day and never got bored. And I must say I am not used to watching a movie more than twice. The action is very good. Gardard Depardieu is also a talented actor and katherine heigl. I want her to be in a good movie because I think she can do it. On balance, it's a movie I can't take out of my mind.
