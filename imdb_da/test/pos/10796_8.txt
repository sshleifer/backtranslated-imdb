*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason, Oliver Stones "Talk Radio" is based on the Stephen Singular book "Talked to Death" and the movie star Eric Bogosian's play about the 1984 murder of Denver talk show host Alan Berg, never got the recognition that it so deservedly deserved. The 1988 film was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that developed on the farm and hinterland of America. A movement that arose some seven years later, like an angry and dissatisfied golf war veteran Timothy McVeigh, who hates the US government's actions in Wacco Texas, leads to his and her friend, Terry Nichols, detonation of the US Federal Building in Oklahoma City April 19, 1995, which killed 168 people, the worst act of terrorism on American soil up to that time. <br /> <br /> The movie is, as far as I know, the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia's novel "The Turner Diaries" of the late William L. Pierce who since has become a chilling underground classic. "Turner Diaries" forecasts a homely and utterly catastrophic terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, at a US government federal facility that was the FBI building in Washington DC <br /> <br /> Dallas radio station KGAB speech show hosted by Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is the top rated show in Dallas listening group and is now going national. Barry get his high rating by his razor sharp white and abusive behavior when in the air. Taking on all future and ducking no problems, no matter how unpopular or taboo they are, has made Barry the most listened and hated man on the radio. Barry is a showman at heart and does not think his speech can lead to violence, stopping his wear for his welcoming listeners as his rating goes up to celling. But there are those in the listening audience, mostly ultra right wing types who do not take too kindly to him in your face state. One of them decides to take matters into his hand at Barry's expense. <br /> <br /> Powerhouse performance by Eric Bogosian as the tragic Barry Champlain who crossed the line from entertainment to real-life in his actions on the radio. Thinking that he is not so important to be sought out and murdered for his on-air opinions that enemies dislike, he found out that too late there are those who are insane enough to deal with him on the outside. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" is a very young Alic Baldwin as Barry's boss Dan, trying to make him soften his tone, but eventually joining with his talk show style as he kills the competition without realizing at last it is him that he ends up being killed. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life, his former wife Ellen and now the lover and talk show producer Laura, who Barry uses to her advantage and almost ends up losing them both at the same time . The 1988 movie "Talk Radio" is so far ahead of the time that even if you see it now in 2005, you still think it is too disturbing to be shown to a hypersensitive and delicate American public.
