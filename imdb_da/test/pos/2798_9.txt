Clich√© avoidance is one of the film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story ?? Erasmus students of mixed nationalities share an apartment in Barcelona ?? You predict a collection of Euro stereotypes in a dangerous tangle. Be careful! In fact, it is a well-judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some extremely observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the English girl's eerie irrepressible brother, the devil's mother of Xavier), and some fine visual humor, especially in the opening scenes, mocking the bureaucratic complexity of the application procedure. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. Instead of a conventional happy ending, there is a horrible portent's final on "Identity" ?? Xavier has become all friends he made. Nevertheless, this very entertaining film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro audience who enjoyed themselves enormously and even applauded at the end.
