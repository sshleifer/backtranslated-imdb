The best British comedy film ever! For years, English comedy TV shows have turned into movies and have the flop: 'Are you served?' 'Dads Army', the list goes on. But the popular dark humored BBC television show; 'The League of Gentlemen' has managed not only to make a movie that has been a flop but has also managed to be the best British comedy film ever! With its dark and horrific twists, the Apocalypse of dominion is the British talent at its best! Its exciting demonic story written by the Gentleman League (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) matches with Gents (and guest cameos) excellent plays! This I hope is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Don't think if you haven't seen The League of Gentlemen on telly, you don't understand what's going on. It's all well explained, and at the end of the movie you'll be happy with the result, but you're still left hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
