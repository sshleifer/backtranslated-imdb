I just watched this movie at Showtime in the bad hours of the night. I looked at the beginning with an eye open, but instead of slipping into sleep, I was invested in this slender, nibbling film. It was very trustworthy and engaging. I could have done without so much profanity (as with any David Mamet movie I see), but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I know teenagers swear, but I don't have to listen to it. Anyways, the story had some interesting surprises that I won't reveal, but if you have a chance to catch this movie on Showtime, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have.
