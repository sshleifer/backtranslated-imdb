I don't know much about the truth and the reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as an entertainment offer. I began to see it late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year), but when I started, I had to look to the end. The bottom side is that it is effectively a courtroom drama - never my favorite genre - but it is fantastically photographed (largely in supersaturated ogres) and well acted. As a good novel, I couldn't put it down. Throughout, I wanted me to see it in a movie theater to do music and photography justice. What happened to the release in theaters? I admire Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks great in this - very feminine and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but she adds the visual appeal of the movie). <br /> <br /> This image deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting.
