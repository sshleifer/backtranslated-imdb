The kind of "little" movie that the studios used to excel at, but rarely do more. Sort of a "soul" version of the more famous "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music, obsessed with the idea of ​​uniting the members of a classical soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as the group members; a casting that includes a true musical talent such as Isaac Hayes, as well as actors Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. Not supposed to be an epic in any way, it's a piece of solid gold.
