Almost certainly the best Three Stooges cards with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' are as good as any of the trio's best shorts with Curly. Memorable Stooge moments abound. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp gives voice education to the domestic, uncountable and mighty Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green) waving her terrible song notes and fighting her progress is an excellent example of Shemp Howard as his best. Many considered him the most naturally fun of Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him get pounded to find a wife (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror is reversed. Attach the mirror, he cries with relief: "There I am" and beautiful as a picture! "" Yes, "Moe responds quickly and tries to raise his slacks" by an APE! "The best scene (and perhaps Shemp's best with the trio) comes when he pays an attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). long lost "Cousin Basil", she forges him with cuddles and kisses (which also leads to a hilarious bit between Moe and Larry in the hall), which does not give him a chance to explain his true identity. Suddenly, REAL Cousin calls Basilica, and She goes to childbirth, strikes him repeatedly and accuses him of exploiting "a poor one." Helpless "defenseless woman"! The final line is delivered when she socks him in the jaw (with a real stroke, according to Shemp and crew members) knocks him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly done gag. "What happened, baby?" Moe asks. "Can I help if I'm not cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before he goes out. /> <br /> Other classic bits include Moe and Shemp that become the same Nailed into a phone box, trying to find a lost coin, Larry is being beaten by Shemp's bad looks (his face is pressed against the phone booth glass), and the big girl is fighting in the justice of peace. The great Emil Sitka delivers its classic line (inscribed on its tombstone), "Keep your hands, you love birds" over and over, as his apartment is rubbish. <br /> <br /> I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as a medicine to anyone who thinks Stooges' glory year ended when Curly left. True, Shemp didn't have so many big shorts with the group as curly, but it was due to an increasing lack of support from Columbia and his (and others) advanced ages. When Shemp was healthy and the trio got decent material to work with, they were still at the top of their game.
