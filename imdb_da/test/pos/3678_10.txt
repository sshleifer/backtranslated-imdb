When I first bought this movie, I had doubts about it, even though it was pretty impressive. But after seeing it, I'm really not sorry about the money. In fact, I would love to use it again and again and again on movies like this .... An absurd combination of humor, drama, excitement and the big questions. It's just what makes it a great movie. Okay, some may not enjoy what they see, and some may even shut it off after a while. your loss. It has a great way to deal with the problems we've all been through in one way or another, and the characters you think you don't want to enjoy in the whole movie turn out to be the ones you really come across to love after a short while. For anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living - see this movie, I promise you you will not be disappointed!
