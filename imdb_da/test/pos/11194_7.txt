My interpretation is that the term 'distant' is used in contrast to 'warm'; people who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the Dalai Lama's teachings in 'The Art of Happiness', where his main point is that the key to joy connects with others. Not only are the characters in the film's organic, but they are also humorous, charmless, shy, quiet and unfriendly. These properties seem to prevent them from, among other things, forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems. And as a result, they are terribly dissatisfied. I see it as a strong assertion of the Dalai Lama's teaching (I'm not a Buddhist by the way). If you are one of those people who believe their behavior is a natural response to living in a big city, then I think you can be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. The city life doesn't have to be like this. <br /> <br /> I can see why some people found it boring - it draws a bit in places, and the characters are not very sympathetic. And it contrasts with Lost In Translation, where the ecological signs are much more sympathetic and connect with each other, even though they do not connect people in general.
