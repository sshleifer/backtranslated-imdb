I went into "Hunt's Night" without knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. It is essentially a mystery / thriller where this girl, who can't remember anything, is 'saved' by a guy who happens to be passing by. The two become quick friends and lovers, and together they try to find out what is happening to her. Through some vague flashbacks and nasty memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked this setting: A deserted, postmodern Paris is the backdrop of lots of gray skies and tall buildings. Very big city. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it was made in 1980; seems a little ahead of time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
