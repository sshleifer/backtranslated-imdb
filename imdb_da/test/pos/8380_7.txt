Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not slip in top gear for the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action hits top speed, it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that require the viewer attention. That's not to say that the first hour is worthless ?? It is just in relation to the last match party, it seems a little underwhelming. The plot is about Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero ?? like those he portrays in his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a young girl, Siu-Yu, who is sold for prostitution, he incurs the anger of his evil boss, Wa. Led by Sonny, head of the scorpion style kung fu, Wa's henchmen give the hunt for Yuk-Su and the girl. Yuk-Su's father intervenes, but he's hurt. After being rescued by some kind of bodybuilders, the three eventually hide in a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also cheats on a regular basis to secretly build his strength and teach kung fu under the direction of Jean, the teacher of the muscular Hulks who saved them. When Master Yat leaves the company, Yuk-Su is back in charge of the kitchen; However, he runs out to practice his skills with Jean and leaves Siu-Yu to serve the customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and spoil the noodles they serve, rinsing the restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su has knocked out, he tells him he should have learned Kung Fu from him; It turns out that Master Yat used to be a top Triad assassin until he decided to try to change his ways. Under the leadership of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills even by learning the art of shadowless kick! Yuk-Su eventually gets a chance to become a true hero when his friend, Fatty, announces that his girl has also been sold for prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa as French brothels looking for new women. When Fatty's girl is presented to them, she accidentally beats their ruse, and finally the action begins great style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is hit hard by Sonny, and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Upon returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds it burned; And worst of all, the evil ones have found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa's place to try to save Siu-Yu ... Despite some rather entertaining training scenes, the slow build for the final act of Wa's house is rather drawn out and without any serious battle scenes. It's a shame that the tedium was not broken up by a decent scrap in the middle of saving all the juicy stuff to the end. However, the last battle is worth the wait; Won Jin gives a jaw that loses performance as kick kicking Sonny, who changes, jumps and spins with great skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance like Yuk-Su, the artist-turned fighter. Also especially good is old-school kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, showing that this old-fashioned still has what it takes to kick ass! Although it's not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely guarantee a show. <br /> <br /> NB. Maybe I got some of the names wrong. My DVD calls characters with different names than those specified on IMDb.
