Forget about all the juicy romantic movies that involve notebooks and loaded couples that somehow manage to go big beyond together after a screen life on simplified unrealistic romance. Forget all the shameless "dogs give their lives to save their family" flicks (though I have to admit that I myself have a soft spot). Forget Ricky Schroeder already shows his inclination to overload in an open age (now it was shameless!). This television movie, which unfortunately never seems to be aired anymore, is the all-time master of tears, hands down. And a well-written and well-functioning story to start. Ann-Margret took a great chance to take this role. Nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here, and it is a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to fight for her dying breath to find good homes for her ten children, instead of letting them be in the hands of unpredictable government bodies. Frederic Forrest does a good job as his husband, the kindhearted but unreliable breadwinner whose criminal arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for the children. <br /> <br /> The movie takes us through Lucile's heartbreaking process of interviewing potential parents and then watching her children go home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and the father - to take care of the tragedy that is happening now and the one who is sure to follow, and frustrated with his inability to do more. The scene where the youngest of the children (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking I have ever seen. Now I grew up as a "hopeless romantic" and have since grown many years ago grown a harder and more cynical shell. I usually find more to mock than to empathize with the sentimental cinematic tripe that was born on us these days. But this pearl from the early 1980s still beats me. <br /> <br /> I really want a person with a market sense to release a DVD version of this drama. Special features include the Emmy Awards telecast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds." In what has to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly giant award ceremony, Stanwyck beat tears during her acceptance speech and struck out, "Ann-Margret, I love you!" That brought Ann-M tears. <br /> <br /> A final note. IMDb rating for "Who Will Love My Children" is 6.4 of this writing. However, over 75% of the ratings are in the 8-10 series (mostly 10). No matter what kind of disability system this site uses to change the overall ratings of the movies specified by IMDb, it is completely labeled on it. This one is "weeper" of all time, and a darn good movie to start.
