When I first watched this movie on video in a department store ... it fascinated me. Considering the fact that I thought I was in love, and I was the same age as the youths in this movie at the time (though I realize they are old enough to be my parents), plus the audio track is written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before they "made it big" here in North America ... I figured I had nothing to lose by buying it. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far I've shown it to many guys I've dated since, and to my current boyfriend ... of course they didn't find it as nice as I do. .. prefer to call it a "chick" movie ... but I still laugh and cry. This movie was largely overlooked. It's good to see it available for rent at one of the local video stores here so others can share the magic. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a little distant ... but it gives you an alarmless feeling of innocence ... and a renewed belief in love.
