I have noticed that many people take opera for the way Betty responds to the murders. I think they base these complaints on how they imagine a "normal" person would react. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person because of traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems long before the movie ever starts ... and at the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she's been completely unheard of. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- Remember that when she was a very young child, she saw her mother's beloved commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochistic mother was about to see it. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman who gets sexual release tied up to see girls being hacked, cut, and swollen to death. It does not provide a healthy home life. I think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have used all kinds of emotional manipulation and negative amplification to make sure her daughter never spoke to her. It is also likely that Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw in her impressive age. Is this just something that adults do, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, Betty looks up to her mother ... I mean ... she's become an opera singer like she. If mama likes it, it can't be bad, can it ... mum can't be bad, can she? She could not tell the police on her mother or this mysterious bird, she connects with mama. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deep-seated emotional issues. Her mind has for years been trying to block the memory of what she saw her mother doing ... but it continues to come to the surface, which manifests itself in the form of terrible nightmares, skull-defying migraines, reliance on relaxation techniques, and sexual liberation. rejects brutal violence / bloody death with sex at a subconscious level. There is an inner battle between the part of Betty who has confused murder / sex and the part of her who thinks these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing her boyfriend murdered by the hat girl ... she calls on the police but is not willing to give her name. The part of her who thinks the murder is wrong forces her to ring, but the part that is ambivalent does not allow her to give personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. Then she goes off the phone in the rain ... and when she is busy with the instructor, she seems surprisingly calm, not as upset as you would think a "normal" person would be ... because that part of her that Having been blocking things when she was a child, her condemned tried to block the horror of what she was just witnessing. The situation in her life all contributes to a dead end in Betty's psyche. Her singing career begins to bear fruit ... she becomes a great opera singer as her mother was. But should she be like her mother in every way? In the darker ways? Or will she be able to make her own way? Add this to the re-emergence of the hat girl who kills everyone around her. <br /> <br /> It is only until the captain kills Daria Nicolodi's character that Betty really plays an active role in defeating the killer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who has supported her wholeheartedly in her new career, which is actually a mother figure in Betty's life ever since her death. Imagine how horrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman who is the closest thing you should have, a mother being shot through the eye. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I don't want to. The main point of what I say is that the character of Betty is much more complex than most reviewers here have been willing to acknowledge. Opera is one of Argento's best ... and not just for the pictures (although they are truly magnificent) and not just for the inventive killings (though they are). There is a depth here ... and attention has to be paid.
