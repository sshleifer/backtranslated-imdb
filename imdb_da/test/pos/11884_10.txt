This film is a good example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the finest instructors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is paced, the story is excellent and exciting, and while humor may not be in your face, it is embedded in the character interactions. When the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation, the whole tower comes down in one of the best fighting scenes (tiger, crane and crab Hung Gar is very present). There is even a scene that mounts Western 18th-century social events and ends with clever and entertaining struggles. The movie ends with a sudden, cheesy moment, but if you are a fan of the Shaw Brothers, you will understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main movie.
