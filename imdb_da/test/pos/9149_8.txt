This movie is a great start for novices who have never seen a 'Silent Film' and for those who believe that quality Cinema started with their generation's efforts. They do a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons. "Silent Film" is an art form for acting in the pantomime that differs from the audio movie and the stage. It can stand on its own advantages. The Beloved ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictitious story of the relationship between the French poet 'Francois Villon' and 'King Louis XI'. Through 'Villons' prodding 'King Louis' will defeat his nemesis 'Duke of Burgandy' minimizing the Feudal System and establishing the King as head of state and the beginning of modern France. Casting is extraordinary, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who only remember him for the overdue actor 'Larry Renault' in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or ham in the INVISABLE WOMEN (1940) it will be a revelation. Fit, trim with 'Great Profile', still proves he is commanding the screen. Co-Starring in its first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with its 'kadaverous spider' interpretation of 'Louis XI'. This is a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other one inch. On a trivia note, Character Actor and Dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO are in their first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character players who will continue in audio that is easily retrieved. <br /> <br /> United Artists saved no expense in this beautiful production under the supervision of WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props and sets are well finished and not exaggerated as in a DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The copy of the DVD, we saw from 'Delta Entertainment', came from a good master. Although it was not "restored", its musical soundtrack was clear and the print was only hit by the downside (dirt) and drop-outs. The only major damage at the end of the last wheel from water. 'Cinema' also has a version that can be of better quality, as they make major restorations on their prints. Best check with them. In our opinion, this is a "must have", especially if you don't have any 'silents' in your collection. This is a great place to start.
