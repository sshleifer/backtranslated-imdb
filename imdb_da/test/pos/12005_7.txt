And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live forever in television countries! And I'm grateful for that. However, this is not one of his finest hours. Columbo goes to college and basically learns how to solve a crime, and yet there are bad guys who move on and think they're smarter than he is. What all of us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a big enemy, how can he be the hero of the curly coat? Still it is better than NO Columbo, and I wait and see also the next.
