Anastasia: Anna's Mystery was a two-part star studded historically T.V. film based on Peter Kurth's book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. Historically, it keeps a lot, names change etc. But stick to the real story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do pretty well like the Russian kings, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What was in my heart were the all too short portraits of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all, it was a beautiful classic production with some fine actors. I was quite awestruck of the production values ​​when it was first shipped on NBC at the end of 1986. Also the star was the fine German actor Jan Niklas, who had previously played in NBC's second Russian epic "Peter the Great". <br /> <br /> I felt part 2 skipped some important details about Anna Anderson's journey to America. It is also important to know that in 1986, the Anna Anderson story was less well known. At that time it was still not known whether her claim to be Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. In the late 1990s there was more known, and Anna Anderson is now known to have been a scam. <br /> <br /> Too late, the network is unable to make fine television films like this one anymore.
