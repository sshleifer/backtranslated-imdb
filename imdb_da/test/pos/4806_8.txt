Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both fantastic in Johnny To's immediate criminal thriller, who puts most Western forces in shame. Think of it as Hong Kong 'Heat', only better! Everything about the movie screaming class; from the performance to the soundtrack, cinematography to the script. The tone remains serious all the time, but the film has a good line of black humor, friendship and romance in its heart. Sure, it will be a little confusing later, but it would be a hard-knit viewer who didn't find anything to love about this movie. God God, Hollywood has not (yet) restored and destroyed a classic. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
