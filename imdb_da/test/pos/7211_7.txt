Can This Really Be A Troma Movie? Some scenes have almost an "A" movie look. The action is generally competent (the two leads and the nurse surrogate were particularly good, and I liked some of the confrontations between the young capsules and ques); the scenes were smoothly edited; the plot is coherent. It is fun. It has a hip, original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It has the usual Troma wholesalers and low humor, but I don't think Shakespeare would have seen so much. In fact, I think he might have got some good laughs out of this. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative comment from the director, several deleted scenes and the usual collection of Troma self-exerting silliness. I don't want to tell you it was Citizen Kane, but it's some pretty inspired low-budget movie production.
