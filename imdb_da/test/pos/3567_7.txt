- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it carries. In their escape, the bandits split. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have another part of "clue" that will lead to the gold. Can banker, bandit and bounty hunts work together to find the missing loot? Or will they first kill each other? - The reason is an obvious starting point for Leone's good, bad and ugly. Various scenes in the film are also lifted from other films by Leone, Corbucci and more. But for me it is done in a way that does not show respect for the original work. Instead, Any Gun Can Play can lovingly parody some of the greatest films in Spaghetti Western History. Three men's opening scene rides into the city, and the final face-off between the three main stars is a wonderful tribute to the SWs who came before. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds many fine details of his own - the reflection of the wasted wine, the Stranger's entrance with the vibrant red background and the legendary way the gold is finally discovered. Although it is very incredible, many of the battle scenes are well tuned and corrected. Two combat situations in particular (the market battle and the bathhouse fight) are very nicely done. He is also keen to try different things with his camera. Tight close-ups, overhead shots and shots around corners are all common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another plus is the cast that Castellari had to work with. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And SW newcomer Edd Byrnes holds his own with the two SW veterans. The beneficiary has, among other things, SW regular Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Any Gun Can Play should not be taken too seriously. Smart strikes of humor can be found throughout the film. If this is possible with a SW, it's more of a "feel good" movie - much like some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer movies.
