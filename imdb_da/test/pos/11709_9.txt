Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynold's best efforts. It is also one of the best modern criminal dramas. Erotic and violent, distinguishes the film by putting the story in Atlanta and delivering a chaotic detective subject to you (the viewer) on a silver platter. Dedicated and definite, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. For a long time, Sharky's crime-fighting machine reveals a conspiracy of the highest order, threatening to destroy the inner body of Atlanta. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I remember the excitement of the city during the film's production. Sharky's Machine goes in great lengths to give a precise depiction of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000 more people later stand the film time trial. Believe me, Atlanta hasn't changed. One of the highlights of the picture is Dar Robinson's bold stunt (a classic, symbolic ending). It was even featured on That's Incredible, ABC's reality show of the period. It's just too bad that Hollywood doesn't make enough movies like this one. Kick back, each your popcorn and watch sterling silver cinema action.
