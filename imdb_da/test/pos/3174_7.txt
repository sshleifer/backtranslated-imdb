An extremely down to earth, well made and listed "Rodeo" Western. No gussied up stars were needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60s and 70s west. But hats especially to Slim Pickens to give what I believe was his signature, especially because he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the only clown role as he deals deeply with all the "ups and downs" of the stubborn rodeo life and the psychological destruction that so often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr Coburn worked very well together as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the correl. See also Anne Archer as Coburn's Indian love interest in the final part of the movie. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as flashy, perhaps as "Junior Bonner", but also heart reproduction and influence on its depiction. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel to show this true laugh of an under-rated movie from time to time.
