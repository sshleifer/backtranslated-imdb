Just under three and a half years after scraping out a month's maturity (October 7, 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (west of 49th Street, then renamed O'Neill), MGM based on London's past solid success in the game to sum up a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully "opened up" production on an unfortunately trimmed down manuscript of this crooked subversive boulevard comedy and was rewarded with a modest hit. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated Stewart Granger's wife, an internationally successful and completely complacent "workaholic" (before the term was invented) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to try to revive passion in his spouse. When "second honeymoon" cruise Gardner invokes Granger in leaves, the trio (and Granger's dog) marinated on a South Sea island (there were other survivors? These are for later plot developments), Granger continues to govern the world around him - building a great cabin for himself and his wife and a little one for the title of Niven - or the unrelated man. The core of the plot of the drama goes only halfway through the film, when Niven suggests that Granger and he wait as tenants in Little Hut - to share the only woman on the island, when Granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes (his) . Reason (which Granger considers his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are amazing in their designated roles of suave would be the seducer and seducer, and Stuart Granger - usually encouraged to just be beautiful and virile in action roles and the strange miscast specia lty (A crowing pretty-boy like Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR and CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the better-performing performances of his movie career as the man who can actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he would once again show this suave urbanity opposite Rex Harrison in Granger's first (and both of his last) Broadway engagements in a hit growth of Somerset Maugham's CIRCLE, which ended only with Harrison's death. We would be far richer if Granger had used these skills more often. <br /> <br /> As promising as menage, this is after all a very British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950s, which is to say that (unlike the source play), very little sex actually continues. To be honest, if you do not leave yourself to ideas that run contrivances, it will be a little stupid (the same basic plot is much more satisfactorily developed three years later in Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger's Genuine wife) THE GRASS IS GREEN, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason that superior trivialities failed at the cashier's office. <br /> <br /> As lavish as MGM put the piece that was unfortunate - The fate that ends the stay on the island is cartoonically influenced by what should have been a moment of real excitement - the lowering of the yacht that sets them on the island. In the end, we only reach about three-quarters of an hour in it real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes by David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger, who make the movie a fun diversion. Not high culture but a worthy guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> t decoration in Walter Chiari (known to be Ava's true lover at that time). As one of his better talks goes: "Boola, boola!"
