"Thriller" remains the largest of the pop music promotions to get a plot, great visual images and a tip-top song to wrap the film around. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at this time (and not so changed in his plastic surgery regime that it matters). Here he is in good shape - the song is fantastic, he leads the zombies into dance like no other. Ola Ray plays the girl who looks with adultery when her sweet girlfriend (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! Then to the pulsating rhythms in the opening line 'It's close to midnight' he stompes around the cemetery with the other zombies and creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The glorious grandeur of all this is the fruitful voice of the great horror star Vincent Price speaks in the middle of the post. Terrific.
