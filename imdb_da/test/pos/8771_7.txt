This is the second Hitchcock movie shown on the list and the second Hitchcock movie I've seen in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock there was more room to walk freely while Rope took place in one room. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope, but it doesn't say this is a bad movie, it just seems like an average flick that could have been more. It seems that a movie Hitchcock would pause between his more serious. As a thriller, I feel that it doesn't really get me on the edge of my seat or engaged to the protagonist running around the states. The climax in the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amplify the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the masks are ripping apart from the sleeve, the need for music for the amplifier of excitement is lacking. Intentional no doubt, but lacking the emotional battle one would have from such a scene. Then it suddenly stops leaving you empty inside. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't feel as though it should be, but they are almost globe-drawn from place to place, but it feels more limited. Scripture itself is very average and seems to be about the more creepy ways to get the plot moving. <br /> <br /> The shows are there but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts for scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leaders is weak and needs more work. One stands out is Otto Kruger, who has the rich ego, evil persona pat. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wanted more from this. I understand it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting movies, but I've had a good time watching it. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastic.
