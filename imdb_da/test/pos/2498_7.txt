The love letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so of course I was skeptical when I heard it was going to be a movie. But I liked it. I found myself laughing throughout the movie. I admit it is not a good movie, but definitely a nice one and a half hour. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I depict them. And the city and nature were just as right. I recommend this movie, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.
