Films about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become lovers of two surfers. <br /> <br /> I caught this on an art cinema here in America in 1981. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was 19), so I was interested in seeing how Australian teenagers acted. Script wise there is nothing new here. It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what would happen before it did, but I never got bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothing and hair, these teenagers are not very different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventure and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. The action was just OK, but the actors were attractive, and it was well made and quite interesting. So this is not an uninhibited masterpiece, but a fairly accurate portrayal of what it is like to be a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. I give it a 7.
