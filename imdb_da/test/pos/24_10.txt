"Sir" has played Lear over 200 times, but tonight he can't remember his opening lines. At the mirror, his eyes reflect the king's madness. His dresser asks him gently and mouths the words. There is an air of desperation about both of these men. The great actor who knows his powers slips away, his cop is great with a conscience with a surrogate wife - conscious of his boss's decline in madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they have become mutually dependent on each other to the extent that neither can imagine a future without the other. Seen during World War II, it is fortunately about an honestly second-rate Shakespearean Company, which includes an equal number of harps and wannabes led by "Sir", a theatrical knight of what could be called "The Old School". No matter what role he plays, he takes the center stage and bends over the headlights and bullies his audience for applause. But somewhere within him buried most of the time deep under the ham, which he regularly straightens, which is still an occasional glitter of his former grandeur. It is to get a glimpse of what his audience hopes for. Mr. A.Finney concentrates heavily on the male, often on the caricature, and just as you are ready to dismiss his achievements as just hyperbolic and bluster, he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that will make you realize great actor plays a good actor. The same applies to Mr T. Courtenay. It is easy to write off his depiction of Norman as an exercise in stereotypes. Here we have a medieval feel rather than living theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life, enjoying the company "The Girls" and love the evil Insider gossip in the "Theater". There were - and I still strongly suspect - many men like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely cheek and patient, knowing more about gamers than many of the actors, they run back with wisdom and love. I think the vast majority of them would promise to approve laughter at Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London scene, where Mr Courtenay's "Norman", unlike the perceived wisdom, was more accomplished than in the movie. "Sir" was played by the great Mr. Freddie Jones for great public recognition. was a memorable achievement that overshadowed Mr Courtenay, and rather reduced him to a "runaway" as opposed to a level billing actor. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without each other went completely out of the window. "Norman" was reduced to being his doll, which I am not sure was what Ronald Harwood intended, but created for breathtaking theater. Sir. Finney and Courtenay alleviate the balance of the movie, restoring equality to the relationship. Both men have come a long way from their early appearance in the British "New Wave" images as they became the bold leftist, "middle class, and ashamed of it" movement. When the British cinema practically committed Hari-Kiri in the 1970s, they clearly focused on the theater except for a few roles to keep the wolf from the door. With the renaissance of wider films, they were again flashing in the unused light. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" marked their return, still fizzing with energy and talent, shouting to the world at large "We're still here". It's not a big movie, but is certainly a great one.
