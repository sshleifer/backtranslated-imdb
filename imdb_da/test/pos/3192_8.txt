First, I saw love in limbo playing late for free for air-TV about five years ago, and since then it's a movie, I will always remember warmly as one of the movies you see and forever is affected by. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, Australian movies have a long history of making off-beat comedies about lovable losers, and Love in Limbo is a sterling example of this. While Russel Crowe is the only name actor in it (although these days he is all a film need), the rest of the Aussie cast is good - he still steals the show as a nervous, nerdy, virgin lover though. <br /> The general premise is much like American Pie. A group of friends who want to be laid and become men. As you would expect, the whole film focuses on this (with a sub-point of management's mother and various other events) and is full of humorous situations that push it toward the inevitable sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy American cake, don't expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to appear. Love in Limbo is not a widespread romantic comedy - but it certainly has its part of grin, fist pumps moments when the good guy wins, and the situations that each guy, Australian or otherwise, can relate to. <br /> <br /> See if you liked: American Pie, Almost Famous. Forces: Good Aussie cast, easy to relate to, good perve value. Weaknesses: Predictable points. My rating: 8 out of 10
