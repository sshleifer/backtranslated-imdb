The journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun, which shares the same circuit as earth and is therefore undiscovered until a space probe on the top of the sun photographs it. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) are sent to explore it, but due to a malfunction, they collide and recover on the ground only 3 weeks in their six-week journey. Of course they are berated (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is seriously injured) and grilled and asked why they returned to their mission, but it is claimed that they did not. Until Thinnes seems to notice some very strange things about being back "at home". This is great if it is something spoken at times, and the sentences and emotions are not far from the "Thunderbirds" area but will live actors for once. It's not a big "Star Wars" production, but quieter science fiction that one has to think about a bit. It is worth seeing, and it is criminal that the DVD is out of print. 8 out of 10
