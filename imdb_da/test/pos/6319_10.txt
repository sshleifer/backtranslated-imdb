While this movie may not be the next evil died (hell who may know it will, it has only been out for a year) It is worth seeing. Don't expect a $ 10 million movie. cuz you will be disappointed. Expect to be entertained, laugh and enjoy the experience. All in all, this movie is much better than many if not all the low budget horror movies out there. I've seen movies that used more than 10 or 20 times what this movie cost to do and turned out to be 10 billion times worse. The effort put into this movie far outweighs the prone frameworks it faces by having a limited budget. Movies are meant to entertain and this movie is safe. In fact, this movie can even open new doors for you in movie watching. It is available on Netflix, if not your local video rental store. So watch for it and take it.
