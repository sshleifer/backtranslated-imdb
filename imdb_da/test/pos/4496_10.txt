OK I haven't read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ????. Who knows ??? // But I loved the movie. It was entertaining, not a bit boring, fun and most of all heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so clean and innocent. These children acted as well, especially the servant's son. Oh my GOD, who is like God's form on the earth's surface. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* The other friend the rich guy is a kid, and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I got angry when he surrendered and ignored his friend during the time he needed comfort. Anyways he was just a kid and a bit stubborn. I wish the film would also have shown the older version of the poor child. Arghh it pains to just think of the end. This movie is sad. I felt very sad at the end. Tears fell into my eyes. Yes the background results are amazing, the scenes are WOW. The kite scenes are fascinating. And well it gets a bit of an adventure in the middle. Wonderfully acted and excellent cast. The kids acted so well. GREAT direction. do not know why this film failed to criticize the critics. But it made it safe for me. 10/10 must-see ??????
