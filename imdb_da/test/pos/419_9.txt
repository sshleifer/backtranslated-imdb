Everywhere I hear people call this show bad, because its premise is too far-fetched .... well maybe a good good driver in Philly pushes it a little (at least the cab drivers I've met), but that's it making the show great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit away from the reality track is a problem, but it is still fun and fun. Its very attentive and even though you know Mike wins out eventually he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a good job in the title role. His cast cast is amazing and I have to say that the location of the show is particularly amazing! <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't see this show because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action I'm looking at this show because it has a great play, a good premise and a great story line every week. It is also a plus when I can select the landmarks he is passing by or know what cross he is on. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a shot!
