Based to some extent on authors, David Croft and Jimmy Perry's own experiences as Butlin's Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK on the same schedule follow the program "Hi-De-Hi!" the epitome of "slapstick, postcard humor" by the post-war UK. In the fictional seaside resort of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi", the comic outcrops in Maplin's Holiday Camp chronicle - one of many dotted along the British coast owned by the mega-rich, but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot section and ran until 1988, when the BBC found it too tame for the fate of comedy department seasons 1-5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6-9 spotlighted in 1960 - a time where the old style British Holiday Camp began to decline. In the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (played brilliantly by late, great Simon Cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager, a well-meaning but cautious, non-university professor who breaks free of his upper-class background and ventured into the "real" world for to manage his team of entertainment staff who were in sharp contrast to his own backward personality. From seaso n 6 onwards, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell stopped the show at the height of his popularity), a former RAF war hero who in many ways resembled Cadell's character in the background, but more But the real stars of "Hi-De-Hi" during the nine seasons were Ted Bovis (played excellent by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working club, ale drinker, bawdy cartoon - a person who could never resist an opportunity to fire the campers ; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc, currently experiencing a career coming back with performances in BBC Komedy, "Little Britain"), Chief Yellowcoat (what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets) and sports organizer - but more importantly , the one person who rescued Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by covering their lack of experience in driving a vacation camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the drowsy but gracious little chalet girl with a fiery ambition to become a Yellowcoat and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé, learns more about "show business" than he hoped for. /> <br /> As usual with Croft & Perry production, the overall cast of characters was a bunch of misfits played excellently by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who was in the 70s when he left the show), the entertaining child-bearing childhood child; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former master jockey with a dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), the sneaky former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their career; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girls Yellowcoats, who were always looking for fun Joe Maplin, would never allow themselves in one of their camps. "Hi-De-Hi" drew slapstick era in the late 50s with the evil and to some extent vulgar "heavy-in-cheek" humor (jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about 'women with big knockers' was the order of the day). But despite being part of "Carry On" funniness, it was always so innocent and became some of the recommended family views back in the 80s. Of course, the critics of the show noticed that the show was out of order, but it was a good couple of years, but I disagree. While the early seasons focused mainly on weakness and slapstick humor, the last series of "Hi-De-Hi" more thought of scripts, and the protagonists (especially Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) could grow with more sensitive story lines. That said, there were a few criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster was no Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the former did not quite have the screen chemistry with Gladys as Jeffrey did (I personally think it would have been more credible if Gladys was married to Jeff); Five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters was not properly explained, especially with the Yellowcoats who came and went with great regularity and the character of Gladys Pugh, who in the pilot section was designed to be a stand-alone man-eater, suddenly turned into a naive virgin-like character! To mention quite pedantically, most of the 1959 season was covered in season 1, so stretching the rest of The year out in five more series was something that was unique to the world. Still, the show was not meant to be carefully watched and the comedy more than outweighed its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> All in all was " Hi-De-Hi "probably one of the last comedies from the BBC's golden era, and even though it never managed to compete with such British comedian backers like" Only Fools & Horses "," Porridge "or even" Last "Of T he Summer Wine "," Hi De Hi "will be remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy. If you haven't already checked it yourself, I ask you to do so.
