I am very impressed with the reviews I have read of this movie - generally well-liked, thought-provoking and informed - of course by people who like and think hard about movies. I couldn't add anything to the excellent audit job that IMDb members have already done. If I want to, I would like to rectify a small but widespread misunderstanding that emerges from many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in a nasty way, but he was not a nasty American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, respected, and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in collaboration with his hosts, and he was very happy and respected of them because he exemplified democratic values ​​and American virtues. His cruelty was pure face, only skin deep; His personality and his humanity were deep and genuine. <br /> <br /> Baseball exemplifies all the innocent, ignorant, insecure boorishness that we Europeans and Americans so often inflict on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our coin that represents our humanity and decency. I think the ugly Americans still far outweigh Mr Baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.
