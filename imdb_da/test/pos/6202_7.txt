I enjoyed this series, but felt that it was all down by the sound recording / mixing. <br /> <br /> For some reason they have had to employ a horrible mass of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the original location sound with a resume in an audio box. <br /> <br /> The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems on the ground or because someone is screwed up somewhere in the audio production chain. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be that bad if the ADR was done well, but at times it's simply distracting. It is not only the ADR that is the problem - the sound mix just doesn't fit the quality of the performances and the pictures. I would be curious to know what went wrong.
