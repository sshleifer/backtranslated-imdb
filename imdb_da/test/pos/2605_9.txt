I have to admit this is one of the few Lou Costello movies I actually saw in the theater. Most have now been seen on T.V., and I must admit that Lou is really funny, and he also gets the girl. This was my first time seeing Dorothy Provine perform and of course I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one. Her performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons why I bought the disc in the first place! <br /> <br /> Every comment on this movie says this is the only movie that Lou Costello did with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou had lived, he would have made many more. He really does a good job and does not have to rely on his old routines for laughing. I am sorry that the little man from Patterson, N.J. did not get the chance to do so. <br /> <br /> I hope this comes out on DVD some time so I can add it to my comedy / sci fi collection.
