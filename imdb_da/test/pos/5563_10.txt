One of the biggest crimes against Sci-fi TV was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-run and at all best shows ever to grace the air waves, it sets new standards for sci-fi TVs. When the flagship, the highest-rated, critically acclaied exhibition of the Sci-Fi channel, speaks the explanatory why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series, and even StarGate: SG-1 have lasted as long as they have. Yes, even Buffy. But I save my Buffy bashing for another time. Farscape was poorly handled by the Sci-Fi channel, continually thrown into planning, rarely appeared and never really advertised. But while the show has been canceled, anyone involved in the production of the show will bring the show back (even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson). There is also a comprehensive fan-based movement to bring the show back. Overall things look far from dark and hopefully the fans get their season 5.
