Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has spent years on a steelworks as a maintenance man who sells the Italian owners to the Chinese, comes at the end of the meeting, where the purchase is arranged because he will tell the new buyer an error he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution. He does not aspire to the Italian old management or to the new Chinese owners. He even fights with the translator about the precise expression he wants to use to express his concern. The next thing we see is Vincenzo arriving in China and trying to contact the new owners. To his astonishment there is a new leader when Mr. Chong, the man he tried to warn in Italy, has been fired. His next mission is to come to the woman who was the translator, Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him in no uncertain way that she blames him for being fired from her position. Liu, who sees Desperation of Vincenzo, agrees to accompany him to find his steel factory. <br /> <br /> Thus, Vincenzo and Liu launch through some of the gloomy landscapes involving traveling by train, steamship, bus and truck to distant parts of the vast land. Finding the right factory turns out to be scary at best, but Vincenzo discovers a strange life for him, as well as finding a kind soul who doesn't hesitate to help the Italian man, despite her original taste for him . <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's movie is a kind of travelogue. He takes the viewer to unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo with Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not quite tangible. The film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip, but it starts to be somewhat less fun when Vincenzo is stranded after separation from Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting instructor, whom he clearly shows with this film, for which he worked on the adaptation of Ermano Rea's novel, which we have not read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actress brings a lot to the film, which in a way is a tour de force for him as he is seen in almost every picture frame. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto turns out to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who makes his debut as Liu Hua, has some wonderful moments and shows good chemistry with his co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its gloom. We see a China that is not a picture card. Mr. Bigazzi catches all green, so typical of the areas where the movie is set. Franco Piersanti's musical score serves the film well.
