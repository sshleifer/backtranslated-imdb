This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. It's again Lon Chaney like The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. Oh yes, the jerk John Carradine is again like Dracula. I like every actor in this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (It is spelled with 2 n's) I thought it was a good idea to have the good-hearted doctor himself condemned as Talbot was. A scene that I think is very good is the scene when Dr. Edelmann is deeply thought when he changes. Everything that disturbs him blinks for your eyes. The good doctor says no, while his evil side says yes. That's the only reason I didn't want the Dracula character to be completely eliminated from this movie. I thought Dracula had no business in the House of Frankenstein. If his character were taken out, you would not miss him. In this movie, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula, giving him his Jekyll and Hyde curse. I hate John Carradine and I don't think he should ever have played Dracula. I didn't mind other actors who played Frankenstein Monster after the great Karloff because they all did good jobs. But when they get another actor to play Dracula, it stops right there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They offered him Frankenstein Monster's role once, and he knocked it down because he thought he was too educated. I could only see Carradine if he played The Monster who argued with the director on the set: "I don't have to take this away from you, I've done Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula, and he will never be. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thank goodness they got Bela back as Dracula for Abbott and Costello. Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. It does not disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. This is a very good supplement to the monster films. If you are a collector, be sure not to leave this one. <br /> <br />
