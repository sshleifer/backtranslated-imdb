Some time ago I saw this when HBO showed it, and from what I saw it, it seemed like a good movie. So I'm in Blockbuster today and I see it there with the DVDs and I decide what the hell. So I rent it. After I finished watching it, I was shocked at how good it was. <br /> <br /> This movie just touched my heart. Everything in it was so amazing. The stories, the actors, the dark humor, the music !!! Oh, don't let me get started with the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the big ones. Absolutely the best place to come out since Quentin Tarantino (a god.) <br /> <br /> After I finished the first impression I saw it again with Anderson's comment (I was surprised at how such a cool guy he is.) <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they don't already have it. Anderson is, of course, a movie lover. In the film, he shudders so many other director techniques. Like the pool scene with the camera, the girl follows the water. Of course, ripped off from "I'm Cuba." But I have no beef what ever with it. The film is very respectable with the ripoffs. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle some of the movie's content (porn.) <br /> <br /> 10/10
