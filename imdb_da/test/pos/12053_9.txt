Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed girlfriend who will do almost anything to win over her lady, which in this case is Juhi Chawla. A little bit by Juhi in the movie that Shahrukh has a big crush on her and is constantly closing her. I must admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty scary ... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the line, "I love you K..k..k..kiran!" It's just a shame that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "together" in the movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a pretty good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic, I still think he did a good job of playing it and can't imagine anyone else doing that. No wonder he got a prize for Darr in 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks particularly great in this movie! It's not that she doesn't always look great in her other movies, but Darr gave the public a wonderful picture of her! <br /> <br /> With regard to the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my very first favorite songs. I also thought "Tu Mere Samne" was nice too. <br /> <br /> A must see for everyone! Overall, Darr deserves a 9/10!
