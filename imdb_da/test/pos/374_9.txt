Secure indeed. Hitchcock is the cinema's ever perverted; But we all know that his perversions are also ours, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but we welcome his wise way of inviting us to an unforgettable train ride. <br /> <br /> I saw Hitch's 1953, I confess, a week before this, and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks. These trademarks stayed in his genius questioning and pulsating his artistic veins wasting psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving blemishes of guilt, rather very subtle awareness of feeling ashame. The pen is always more powerful than the sword, and Hitch fixed the most arguable issues with his wrist, and held so firmly with his hands and held cameras that always reflect peoples dry blood (most people have), otherwise comedy would not be for it Mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh would not be so complex. A mix of all dark elements in "high society", with a wealthy psychopath Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player will be politician, Guy, the story is one of the most well-built and governed by Hitch who inspires many filmmakers, not only with his plot, but with tricky images that evoke dark smiles and happy nightmares. Just perfect!
