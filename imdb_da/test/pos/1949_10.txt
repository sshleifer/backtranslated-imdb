I don't expect much from this movie, it was just one of the movies I thought I'd just watch because it was on television. I certainly underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and boasts to his friends. I was very happy with the actor, they had played the players well. It was a particularly big scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talk to each other about why John killed Jamie. It is disturbing to hear how he explains that he would have control and that is why. But Feck had loved the girl he had killed. Feck felt remorse while John felt nothing, he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt, and Ione Skye was good. It's strange to see her as a valedictor in Say Anything and her as Clarissa. Every actor did great on ..... acting. It was really nice for a change. It was a great movie and I would definitely recommend that I recommend it.
