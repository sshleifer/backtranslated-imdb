Closet Land is a fantastic, scary piece of cinema. It has only two players in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and uneasy, the scenarios maintain your attention while adding your own sense of confusion and terror. The action is excellent, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty to perform each scene. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie in 1991, shortly after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; Not surprisingly, given its political content. It must be seen, however. It has a brilliant set of torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience into its citizens. The country is never called, which makes it even more striking. It could be everywhere; East, West, 3. World, 1. World. It illustrates what happens when a small group of people determines what is best for everyone; when the government becomes the ruler of the citizen, rather than the waiter. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a child writer who has been pulled from her bed at night and exposed to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant clerk. At first, it seems a terrible mistake and she is free to go; but fear causes her to stay and the terror escalates. She is increasingly exposed to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play and twisted logic to break down the author. She is humbled and permeated, forced to endure strenuous bodily positions, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> Throughout, she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that everything will end if she just writes a confession. A simple little action. She refuses. Throughout her, she uses defense mechanisms that have evolved since childhood. It has been slowly revealed that she was the victim of sexual abuse of childhood. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to exceed her torture and turn tables on her interrogation. She begins to attack her own faith and profession and forces him to examine his own life and motives. In the end, she is free because she maintains freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one trapped by the state. <br /> <br /> This film was made during the height of the Cold War, Apartheid, and at a time when crimes from many governments around the world made daily news. It is even more timely in a world where "hostile camps" are held and interrogated in secret prisons, denied legal rights or advice; where "ethnic cleansing" is waste for whole societies, and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that the individual can stand up for the state or another oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.
