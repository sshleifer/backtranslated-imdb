Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine great writing, good production and emphasis on clever ideas about juvenile papers. The two stars work well together and what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Placing "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the movie was brilliant. Watch this movie with your kids. If you do not laugh all the way through, you should not have been aware.
