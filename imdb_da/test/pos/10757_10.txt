A young missionary returning from China in 20 years refuses to become CAT'S-PAW for a gang of hometown caps. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit of a departure from Harold Lloyd's previous movie. Comedy derived more from dialogue, often quite serious, dominates here, rather than the elaborate synagogues that drove Harold's classics from the past. However, there are some amazing moments that are pure visual fun as when Harold tries to follow a convertible into a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub from losing clothes. There is also the climatic scene in a Chinatown cellar where Harold pleasantly jumps into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor comes from Harold's refusal to be the criminals who have been driving their hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And it's a whole bunch of crooked politicians and bullies that Harold opposes, played by a wealth of fine character actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and Stamming Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is present as the tobacco stand girl who catches Harold's eye and keeps him fascinated by her no-nonsense outlook on life. <br /> <br /> Movie belly recognizes Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary; Charles Sellon as an older Stockport priest; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all unapproved. Also, appearing for a few seconds as an attempt on the kidnapper is Noah Young, a well-known face from Harold's silent film, making his final appearance in a Lloyd image. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film a fine production value, especially in the opening scene in China.
