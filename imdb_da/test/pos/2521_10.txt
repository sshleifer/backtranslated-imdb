For the first time, I saw this masterpiece on VHS 10 years ago, and the strong interpretation of angry-child-painfully opposed society as it brought it was held in my heart since then. Director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the children's childhood from the poverty class. Even the excluded children have their innocent beautiful dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives a chance ... Thanks to the publishers for the latest DVD release, I can now hold this amazing movie for my favorite collection.
