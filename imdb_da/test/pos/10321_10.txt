This is the very first Three Stooges card with Shemp that I saw, and that's one of my favorites! That's what I really liked about Shemp when he returned after Curly's stroke, he didn't try to be as Curly, he was his own character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my favorite third stooge, I like him more than curly, but I like Curly as much as I do Shemp. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's stupid, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel, and Moe entered the cabin with him to find it, and they ended up being smashed in the wires and really badly hurt! <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was scary was when Shemp had his face smashed against the phonebooth's glass, he looked like a deformed professor Snape! Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happen in this short, but it's just typical Three Stooges, they always have many bad things happening to them! <br /> <br /> This short is another to watch for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
