I was amazed at this early performance by Clint Eastwood. I hadn't read a summary of the movie when I decided to watch it on TV. Because of Mr. Eastwood I expected some good shots and no deep story. I was completely wrong. I found a few issues exceptionally explicitly addressed, and finally I couldn't think of who is good and who is bad. This movie is certainly not typical Eastwood, but certainly worth seeing.
