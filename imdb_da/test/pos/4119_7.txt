George Saunders is a pastor who steals a rare copy of Hamlet and kills a guard in the process. Months later, an associate of him sells fakes of the book for large sums. One of the fakes is sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not happy to be taken the Nazi front man insists on getting the money back while showing an investigator working for one of the other scammed clients. The midwife in an effort to stay safe starts playing all sides against each other and creates a meeting in the New York public library between different parties, but when people start to die, the library is locked down and more murders (and perhaps some rare book, larceny ) seems to be close to happening. Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a big cast (Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid support players) If there is a mistake, the movie is almost too complicated with plots in plots and all pretty much out of sight self . The teams of theft, forgery, murder and war-time intrigue (this was 1942) are almost too many in the short 70 minute run. Still, it is an enjoyable little movie with darkness and a sense of inevitable downfall for some of the characters that clearly mark this as one of the first movie neighbors. Until Denning comes up, we are down among some charming thieves we like, maybe even more than the hero, but it is clear from word and deed, it is not going to get a happy ending and they know it, though they fight it. A good little movie that is worth finding out.
