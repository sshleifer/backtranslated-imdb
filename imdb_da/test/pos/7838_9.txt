I just watched a few episodes of "eleventh hour", but I have to say they were enough to impress me. This series is just as impressive and interesting ... I'm sure to follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the play is first-rate. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - trustworthy and cool, and he makes the audience believe in the character. Other characters, like Rachel, are also trustworthy, and although they are sometimes a bit cold - because of the way the series is recorded, they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories from this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was cloning and a man trying to clone people. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - tracked and savvy people were amazing. Moreover, it has made you think of ethics and how good or bad it could be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it's a good TV program. I just hope it continues like this - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. Although it is recorded in a kind of cold way - little lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never stops being interesting. Very advisable.
