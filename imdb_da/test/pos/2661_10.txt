Humanity's self-awakening is the theme of "2001: A Space Odyssey", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We "see" our primordial past, and we "derive" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey. From this transcendental perspective, a conventional egocentric plot appears superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-serving dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a widely understood cosmos. It is a hard lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprisingly, as some of us huff and blow about the movie's slowness and minimal history. For perceptive viewers, the consideration is an inspiring sense of wonder and awe. In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols control our intuition. Circles and arches represent nature. High angles represent conscious intelligence. Some believe that the slim, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without a doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is more profound than explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique among film and content content. The kinematics are outside this world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is art in the highest sense, such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Vincent Van Gogh's "The Starry Night".
