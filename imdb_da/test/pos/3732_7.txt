WTF !! Does any of his books / movies make a good end? The notebook was good ... but sheesh, probably with the depressing conclusions already. I am told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandably ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only come to a mediocre miserable time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and live it for the rest of Their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life? Can't we - for a moment (an hour and a half) live vicariously through a movie ending with a happy note - it gives us hope for our own futures ??? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But for really I think we should order movies that end like this with a warning. "Beware: No happy ending."
