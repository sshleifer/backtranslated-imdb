OKAY. Is Barney the best children's exhibition at any time? Of course not. But in some of the comments made by other members of IMDb, you would think it was a multi-million dollar production with high-ranking players and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. He shows children good behavior, good manor houses, and it's okay to be who you are. For those of you who find him annoying, it's because you're not five years old and the show wasn't for you. To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page, I think you might have gone a little too far. Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as "down to earth"? Adult up everyone, this is a good show for preschool children and actually helps the kids learn in a fun and creative way.
