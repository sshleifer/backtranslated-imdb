This movie is great from start to finish about a group of students who meet and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then reviving themselves. They then examine what happens from "near death" experiences. As each one goes through the experience, they are haunted by their deepest fear, which seems to be a reality. This ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead fathers who seem to be upstairs. The game is first rate and Oliver Platt is fun in one of the best roles in his career. I'm not a big Keifer Sutherland fan, but he's doing an excellent job himself. This is a movie I can see again and again!
