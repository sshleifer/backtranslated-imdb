I will not drill you with history and plot lines as they have been presented many times already on this site, so ?? It's been a long time since I've seen such a movie. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and undervalued qualities that are rare in these times of clich√©s. The beautifully muted photograph, saturated in rich luxurious colors and lack of better words, is each frame filled with a voltage air. The settings and locations are used repeatedly, but the film manages to breathe new life into them every time they highlighted. There always seems to be a key plug, light fixture or set piece for little to hang the audience on where we are in the characters world. <br /> <br /> The action reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget you see two actors involved in their craft. There is meaning behind every gesture, and almost every movement has given importance to explaining the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the emotions, and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse, but like the rest of the movie, it is permeated with meaning. Talking about meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here it becomes a narrative narrative unit. And while the film is of Chinese origin, a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole allows the subtle meaning of the movie. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used with the story, not just a means of putting music into action, or encouraging the audience to feel a certain way at a particular point. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone I fear most people will be cramped by the quiet flow of history, but I would recommend it to anyone seeking an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexers on our side of the world. I must say I was completely taken off this movie and continued to watch it the night after. The story takes time to present itself and carries repeated views, as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful movie.
