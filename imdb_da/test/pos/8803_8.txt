I walked in not expecting much from human traffic and came out really happy! The film is well made and acted and very stylishly shot. It has so much to do for it - it's a movie I really recommend, especially for those who liked Trainspotting (or for those who like to argue for the debate in the drug and media sector). Great fun.
