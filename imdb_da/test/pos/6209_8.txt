Preston Sturgis' Power and Joy was invisible to the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurrected and even appeared on television. In the meantime, it had been known because Pauline Kael's WITNESS BOOK had suggested that Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles manuscript for KANE was based on Sturgis play here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the movie on the IMDb website, Kael covered his case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators turning to Charles Foster Kane's life: the spreadsheet (representing Ralston - Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond Butler. Each has its second slope on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course, each one reveals their own mistakes when they tell their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping repetitions of the same event. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in the POWER and GLORIET. Yes, like KANE, it's about a legendary corporate manager - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from scratch to being the head of the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional view we sometimes get with Kane in Garner. Henry, when he talks, talks about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the skeptical public voice - she only sees the mistakes in Henry. <br /> <br /> Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom is becoming more and more anti-work in his later years. Trade unions are troublemakers, and he doesn't care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a larger way, and how it embraced him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. I'm not really beating the POWER and the GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few movies do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I realize the story is well presented to keep one's interest in the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the world-class success of the parades has been brought home. <br /> <br /> When they married, Tom would like to do well (partially) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America, great business success comes at a price. Tom gets deeply involved in driving the railway empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses contact with Sally. And he also notes Eva (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes her mistress. When Sally learns about her incredible behavior, it destroys her. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Tom gets a full shock (making him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eva marries Tom and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eva's son of Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete success - the action sometimes jumps unconvincingly. But that makes the business a reality (note the scene when Tom tells his board about his plans to buy a small rival train line and he discusses the use of bonds to fund the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring this kind of detail. So, on the whole, it's a premium movie. No BORG KANE maybe, but of interest to film lovers as an attempt at business realism with social comments in Depression America.
