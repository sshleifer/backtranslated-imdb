For the plate I am a curly fan through and through. But I have to say that in reality Shemp wasn't that bad. Yes, he could have lacked the same kind of slapstick that Curly had, but in his own way he was fun. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music professor (Stooge? a professor? yes right) who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle, and Moe & Larry must prepare him to marry a woman at six in the evening or no money. <br /> <br /> This was one of Stooges first shit with Shemp before they began reusing their material. Perhaps it is not surprising that Shemp was part of Stooges before Curly entered the picture, so he seemed natural to this. Slapstick gags are fun, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone box. Essential Stooge card to be honest.
