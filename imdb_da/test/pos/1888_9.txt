I saw it last night and I laughed out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made an amazingly fun movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the movie becomes crazy, it's really crazy. Just a fun scene after another. My hats to Mr. Campbell and crew to pull this out on such a small budget. Bruce was there to introduce the movie and make a Q and A, which was a treat. Many of the questions people asked were rather lame, but Bruce would turn them around and be sarcastic. He was amazing! Anyway, loved the movie. I'm looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year. B sure to check it out on the Sci-Fi channel in the fall. I highly recommend this one.
