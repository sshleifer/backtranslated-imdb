This is not very well written. The songs are not memorable. However, the cast hugs much of this Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation. They both look good as young sailors. They are trustworthy. The scenes on the submarine show how tight it may have been to these underwater tasks in the 1950s and before. <br /> <br /> Lots of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps in a large outdoor training area and again in a boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You'll see James Dean in his scene. He stands out even though he's an extra here. In a scene where Jerry crosses a busy street, we see some of his "almost unhappy" comedies that he would bring in play years later in The Patsy. <br /> <br /> Dean gives Jerry boxing instructions a good comedy shit to look for. Jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy, which was his trademark in the late 40s and early 50s. Dean and Jerry dances are a bit of a treat. Not great, but better than most non-dancing movies. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. Good ending. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
