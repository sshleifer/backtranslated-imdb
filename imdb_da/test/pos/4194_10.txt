I will admit that I previously had the opportunity to watch this movie and after approx. 5-10 minutes into it, I felt that many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that looked like the TV show, but instead I was given ... Well, I didn't know what I got to be honest. <br /> <br /> But after finally watching this movie, I realized that I not only had a closed mindset to the brilliance it portrays, I also found myself watching it over and over again. It is the only movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert as I try to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I've figured out something in the movie, that answer is broken when I see the movie again. Brilliance indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who did not like this movie want to watch a movie with primarily a clear plot. They will have everything explained and all questions answered in the final. Sorry, if that's what you want, it's not the movie for you. But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their successors) I think you'll appreciate the thoughtful, mindblowing experience this movie will give you. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the movie is like a dream. In our dreams it does not matter, things we expect to do, do not, peoples and things do not speak, work, or work in the same way they do in reality. Complaining about "Head" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you couldn't understand. The mind is a complex system, and that a movie titled "Head" is just as complex, is it so difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and music tracks) really stand out, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks in the movie, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long Title: May I do all this again?" This movie shows that The Monkees was much more than just four zanny guys in a "pre-fab" group (as their critics called them) on a TV show, but they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for. There are so many messages that can be retrieved from the movie, both with regard to The Monkees and to the "Entertainment Industry" in general, that it stands as a masterpiece of film making that was far ahead of that time. <br /> <br /> I feel that if this movie had been released as an independent piece at this time, it would actually get the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And a final note: <br /> <br /> You could compare this with The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour movie, as The Beatles movie seemed to be just as weird and bizarre. But in my opinion, "Head" is far above all that the Beatles put on celluloid.
