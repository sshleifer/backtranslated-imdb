Critters 4 is a great movie. A bit of a twist to the series, as it happens in space, not in an earthly society. Good effects and action make this movie a must see. I would recommend this to Horror / Science Fiction fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this will check puppet master, skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
