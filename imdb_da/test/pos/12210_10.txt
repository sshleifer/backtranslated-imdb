I'm new to this, so thank you. I'm a big fan of Surface. I thought the script and computer graphics were exceptional, as well as any Sci Fi flip I have seen in the theater. In February, the TV Finish Seasonal Guide said the show's announcer said something about the effect of "... and now on the season's final of Surface." Seasonal finals, not serial finals! I couldn't wait for a fall to come here to see it happen next time. So fall here and there is nowhere to be found! If NBC is not gonna get it, what about Sci Fi or USA? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long on ABC & so the US picked it up and it went on puzzlers! (I bet ABC was chocking) Ha! If not a series, then at least a mini-series, to give all of us loyal fans closure. What happened to our guy caught in the church tower? Was the creature in the chapel Nim? Has he had a grouth spear? Will the cloned guy come over to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thanks for listening to me, babies!
