Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian born animator who lives in France, doing incredible things through stop-motion. I've seen a couple of these movies before and they have his favorite subjects - insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and lively and even today they are amazing to look at - the quality is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> This one stars lots and lots of frogs. They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, Jupiter wonders - their life is just fine now. So, to teach them a creepy lesson, he makes an egret king and one by one it begins to eat his subjects! Then the frogs once again appeal to Jupiter, who says the obvious morality that it is best to be content with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the animation quality is incredible, this is a very scary movie for kids. I would think it would fear them both knowing how real the animals look as well as the story itself, which is not too faint in heart!
