I saw this series at PBS in 1980 in college and I still can't get it out of my head even though I've never seen it since. I remember every cast member (the casting was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), design, lighting and of course the story, which in itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best TV show I've ever seen next to the original "roots".
