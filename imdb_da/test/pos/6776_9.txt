This is by far the best movie I've seen for a long time. It is a completely original and beautiful plot. It's not boring, nor is it too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but it doesn't take away from the story. The fact that there is no English is most likely the last print. The end leaves you satisfied in a way I have never experienced in a movie before. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this movie earlier. Multiple lines. <br /> <br /> more lines. <br /> <br /> Several lines on many more lines are, I'm done
