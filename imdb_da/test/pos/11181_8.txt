Because I unfortunately couldn't find them anywhere, I haven't tried any of the other items in the series, though I certainly wouldn't mind it and believe in me I've seen. For anyone who doesn't know, this is a point-and-click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to interfere with everything you can do with it, even if there is a particular matter in this where it is inaccurate. I don't want to spoil it here for anyone who hasn't tried it yet. Nevertheless, no matter how little experience you have with computers, you can sit down and try it out. There aren't even terribly many pieces of this, where you have to be quick or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have it has subtitles on) and thus speak in it, and it is not hugely awkward or forced when it is slow. Access to your inventory is easy as well as combining or using items. If you click the button and hold it down, you can get three options for what you need with it (be it a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Hand (press, download, open, etc.) , eyes (examine, look through, etc.) and mouth (eat, converse, etc.). It adds up to an inviting and friendly environment where you can approach the many puzzles (the amount of them is varied, based on which of the two difficulty settings you are trying on) at your own pace and explore and take dozens of individual, creatively finished characters and areas in this to the content of your heart. The length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do so (you do not blame me, they are worth it) and your ability to find the solutions. There are a few points in this, where you will determine if you want the more difficult way to complete it or not. This can be enjoyed by anyone from any age. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. This is one of the products that helps prove that this fact does not mean that it is unacceptable to older audiences. The animation is quality work, smooth, everything goes as it should, and the third dimension is honestly not so much missed when trying this. The storytelling is well done and you are never unclear what is going on. There are many orderly cut scenes that are preserved in the same colorful, mostly bright 2D world as the rest, with well-cut camera movement. "Cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe this and not just the visual style. It can be applied to all this. The whole world here looks very much but not quite the same as ours, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can recognize or understand at least parts of, but the absurdity makes them fun. It should be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: It's fun. Much of it comes from the spoken lines (what is said and how it is), and those who dig British efforts focused on verbal, like the "Allo" Allo or the BlackAdder franchise would like to check this sucker. various types of jokes, including, but not limited to, the following: satire, wisdom, darkness, spoofs, irony, widespread comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and much more, there is self-awareness, with management addressing you personally and for example explaining why He doesn't want to do what you've just asked him about. There are references to pop culture for a few decades. Almost everything works, almost no gags fall flat, and if you're not stinging this, my best guess would be be that it is simply not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that guarantees no judgment and if you suspect it might be the case and want to find out, I suggest the demo version where you free can see whether you are interested in the brand of games and / or laughter. The reason is well written (almost all this is really), developing nicely throughout and keeping your interest good. The sound is all excellent, sharp and suitable. The sound effects are spot-on. The music is well composed without exceptions. The voice action is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. Armato is great as Guybrush Threepwood (should love the name) that you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, the late (and still threatening) zombie villain. The designs are incredibly well-designed, very imaginative and all fit. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to piracy, you get to share in some. Control a ship, manage it by others, and match the leaves in a rather unique and wonderfully thought-provoking way. The replayability is mainly in the options, during dialogue etc. This is linear, with a bit of freedom as far as the order goes, so the buccaneer sits down with this at least the second time, does not have that great A number of opportunities to be challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone who would like to dive into a thoroughly well-crafted and fascinating fictional universe, and burst countless times, should get a real kick out of this. The good kind, not those that hurt and potentially leave bruises. Don't forget, kids, * don't * eat books ... it's just begging for a paper cut. I would bet on a guess that those who like the others also appreciate this. And they are not the only ones who can get into this. I recommend this, except for members of the aforementioned group, any fan of this genre of VGs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8.10
