This ranks as my favorite movie all the time. It's the best fake of a science fiction movie ever; The fact that it was a send-up of Star Wars did so well. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Think of this when the Marx brothers or the three stooges meet Star Wars. Scripture is fun. The effects are a hoot. The free association that takes place guarantees all sorts of things coming out of the left field. (I almost reached my pants when the Wookie Monster accosted the Princess.) Space Balls was a much longer movie but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it, and I felt blacked out after ripping, like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. Hardware Wars, despite being only about 15 minutes long, would be worth paying an IMO price.
