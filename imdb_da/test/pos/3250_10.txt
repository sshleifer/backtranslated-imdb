I saw two hands back in Sydney a few years ago, and it immediately became one of my all-time favorite movies. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up in one (and a little zen thrown in good measure). As a lot of Australian films, the plot is easy to follow, but it is great to engage, and Jordan is right to be proud of his work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was on TV right now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes of not only this movie, but actually some movies, were cut out! So if you see this movie, make sure it is the original version.
