"Tesis", "Open Your Eyes" and "The Others" was a testament to Amenabar's talent and skill as the filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also falsified films in their attempt to throw away the audience and always offer a turn screw for Many, favor cheap tension, twists and turns over depth and resonance. Lucky for everyone Amenabar chose a subject for his new movie that would not allow a surprise ending with a focus on characters and the emotional ties that bind them. <br /> <br /> The result is a little miracle of a movie, beautifully written, photographed, scored, acted and directed. All involved in this movie provide a carrer-high performance behind and in front of the cameras, from the wonderful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film a great authenticity) to Aguirresaroba's exquisite Lensing. <br /> <br /> The movie tapes on many relevant topics and emotions efficiently, it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits. This is a brilliantly crafted movie that will not only be a landmark in Spanish cinema but will surely be a pleasant surprise when it opens abroad (Sony Classics has paid a $ 6 million record to distribute it). Don't be surprised it manages to get into the Oscar race ... There are no stops for Amenabar ... Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
