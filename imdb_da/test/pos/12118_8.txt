I enjoyed it for a couple of reasons. The emotional tangle was sometimes confusing and incompletely resolved, but the mixture of news movies with the film's story was often convincing. The other element that I appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves, the fanatical Nazis, who continued the struggle after the formal surrender. I don't know of another movie that deals with them. They murdered Mayor Oppenhoff from Aachen on Palm Sunday, 1945, and created problems for the occupation. The movie then challenges the sanitized version of victory and obsession with some cruel realities. The "human problems" are not presented so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that grabbed those who had survived Hitler - both conquered and victorious.
