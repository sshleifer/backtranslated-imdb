The excellent and complex play has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and lots of characters, played by a fantastic cast, actually a star constellation. the direction is amazing; Music scores are amazing. I really loved this amazing movie and I have to finish my review because of my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem.
