If there is a theme in this movie, it is that people can cope with adversity by having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works cemetery, and their mother works double shift, and Peter is constantly picked for a number of reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often confused with a girl. He's just starting to approach the age of 10 or 11, where your perceptions begin to change, and think your appearance is starting to do something. The background to this story is the 1967 World Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The movie's greatest moments come under the different fantasy sequences, where we only see how they manage. Watch the flick, and if you've ever had a childhood woman you dreamed of, and for some reason lost, you'll really like this movie. Maybe the kids will like this movie, but only adults will really appreciate it, including its references to Bolshevik and what the parents' will does for their children.
