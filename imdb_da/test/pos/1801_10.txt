This is a romantic, albeit cheesy, movie that is one of my favorites all along. It's one of the many classes in the 80s genre like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heartbreaking love story that makes you calm for him to finally win the girl. <br /> <br /> True, most of the play sucks but ... I've been in love with Nic since watching this at theaters and have seen almost every movie he's been to since. He's really grown up as an actor, but it's obvious in his early films that he had a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love 80s movies, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
