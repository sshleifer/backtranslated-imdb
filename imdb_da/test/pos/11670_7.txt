First of all, let it be known that I came into this movie not to the music; In fact, I find it contradictory. Really, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. At this point, the documentaries did pretty well. An unpleasant aspect was the many scenes in which songs are played, and the hyped-up band and belligerent crowd are constantly appearing amok. If you've seen the first kind of scene, you've seen them all. This abundance is a party consisting of writing texts for some of the songs. With these, the audience can mentally join the band. The lyrics are far more interesting than sounds from the sounds from the speakers. I do not know why all the texts were not printed. Scenes without lyrics slowly (ironic eh?, Given the many references to the music's speed) the flow of the movie. Also insightful were interviews with fans and bands, although there is a letdown when the latter's interviews turn out to be almost as sensational or humorous as the first two. All in all, a good movie that I love, I saw. I will check the follow-up if I ever get a chance. Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he could not play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass. <br /> <br /> Wide punk generalization: Although their disgrace, lack of vocabulary and hygiene and drug-induced obliviousness are often fun, ultimately it is understood that punk is just pathetic juveniles that rebel just for guilt rebellion as seen through sophomoric texts and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (ignore the black flag, which is slightly less misleading than their peers).
