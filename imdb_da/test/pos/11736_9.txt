I always loved the clumsy voice guy in all the westerns. He was the side ticket (Jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickock show back in the 50s. In this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. He is harmless, and no one believes in him, but he is not confused and goes anyway. When you have a guy like this, there are no challenges because the details are not there to stifle. Of course, in this episode, he's taken aboard a spaceship of a group of foreigners who have no sense of humor and believe in everything they hear. They do not have the word lying in their vocabulary. As it turns out, he is so inadequate that they cannot cope with him; And then of course there is the secret weapon. See this just to see Andy.
