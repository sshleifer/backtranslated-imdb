A really good Australian movie. Beautifully recreates the look and feel of Sydney as it was in the 1950s. This movie impressed me a lot when I first saw it during the first cinema release, and it still stands out very well. Well-guided job by Phil Noyce, wonderful camera work, thoughtful lighting and some fine performances across the board. An absolute "Must See" for all students from the 70's Australian cinema. One out of the box!
