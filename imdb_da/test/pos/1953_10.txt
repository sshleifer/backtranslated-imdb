Apparently, this movie was based on a true story. However, I am not sure how precise it is. But it really reminded me how, when I see someone being murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I'll continue. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. No one really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. So what's the point? <br /> <br /> The murderer of this story is John, and for the vast amount of the movie, he conceals with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older and you can see the generation gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asked John if he loved the girl, he simply killed: "She was okay." The movie only seems to offer a solution: Life is more important than death. A character's life is spared, people get other chances, and a hopeless case is killed. <br /> <br /> The action is really good. After watching this movie I could only come to the conclusion that Crispin Glover is either a brilliant actor or a horrible actor. I still have no idea. He was my main reason for watching this movie. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Although fashion is really the 80s and characters sometimes mention such current issues, I still think River's Edge is just as relevant today as ever. <Br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
