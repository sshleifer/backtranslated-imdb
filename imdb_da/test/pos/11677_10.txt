I watched this movie in the theater when I was 14, and it changed my life. I immediately interrupted my hair and started buying all the books of the books in the film. These were some of the last bands by L.A. punk rock caught on film at the top of their powers. Bands like Black Flag (pre-rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and Germs have few in the story of punk music. I can't believe this movie has never been put on video or DVD. Great movie for fans of punk rock.
