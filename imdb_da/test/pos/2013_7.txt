Jon Cryer represents his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men who he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl his colleague has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's best friend is quite fun. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and begin to dance. In one of the funniest lines on television ever - I think in the last episode - he and his partner discuss that he wants to propose the girl. <br /> <br /> His partner is currently preparing him by suggesting: "What's the worst thing that can happen? She says no." <br /> <br /> Armed with newfound optimism, he suggests his date for dinner. As she replies, <br /> <br /> "GOD, NO!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard I cried.
