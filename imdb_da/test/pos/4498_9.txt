one of the best and most inspiring films about another culture I've seen this year. tragic and touching. worth the watch. maybe a couple of times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this film hit the nail upside down. perfect! Kite runs are great and I have to examine the validity of that event. although it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting. to maneuver a dragon so that a single string seems impossible, but they make it credible. anyway, this movie has many twists that are, I'm sure many, probably enough to figure out, but they hit me before I could. which makes a great movie for me! When you reckon with the entire movie for the first 10 minutes, it destroys it. but this makes it so smooth that it's hard to guess it even when it happens ... I'm a guy and I don't mind saying that tears floated on more than one point in this movie.
