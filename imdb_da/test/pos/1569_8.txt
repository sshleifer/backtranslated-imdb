While I can understand some of the points made in cinematography (I thought a more targeted approach would have better supported low-fi, home movies feel) I must say I thought the script and the WHAT ALICE action FOUNDING was EXCELLENT! Dean Bell has made a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven joy. Her performance by Sandra is a pleasure - unfolding, alternating, as devilish and romantic. We are immediately fascinated and rejected by her actions ... and never given more information than necessary. Her and the backing's efforts meet Bell's postmodern weapon-wide adventure. Emily Grace's Alice is infused with a doey-eyed magic. She seems to mold like clay before us, morphing into some kind of beautiful, lost animal. At the end we are in contrast to words she says goodbye to her mother. Kudos should also be expelled to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother gives the right amount of tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - if shy the first time John, Sam, gives one of the cutest, if not most awkward, sex scenes in movies. Bell made a first-class story and brought together a wealth of talents to do so.
