A demon from a tree removes itself in the form of a human man to love a young, fair girl only for her to die. The demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed he had specifically created for his desire if desired. The bed consumes the blood, and it remains hungry. Everything that comes into contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is "inside" one of his last works, the artistic reproduction of his final resting place (... he died of consumption, coughed blood, decided to die on deathbed). You can see the painter, which we can see as if he was trapped in a small room through his painting, unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this through it allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other belongings once owned by the master. A victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement that lives in the bed. The film has three young women who come across the manor house, which holds the basement with the deathbed. The painter (Dave Marsh) can only have a method of destroying the deathbed, but it will include a human victim to revive the body of the one whose death caused the hunger in the first place. Patrick Spence-Thomas gives the captured painter's soft, depressing voice, tells the film, regrets his current situation, tells us about past victims and often frightens the bed of the predator. <br /> <br /> A final, real cult movie. I expect it's state to hover now that BIRTHDAY: THE BED, AFTER, has found its way to an audience (... like myself) who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. The bed itself contains a liquid-type acid with an apple cider shade where we see objects and people (struggling for nothing) consumed. Many may recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls, search for his crazy sister, find her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized (of course Julie Ritter was largely this way of whole movie, in trance, barely pronounce a word) with both of them trapped. In one of the film's most demented scenes, Russ only tries to stab the bed for his hands to get caught in the grip, the meat soured with only the skeleton bone back, cartilage deteriorates. There is a slow attempt to escape from a victim whose legs were trapped in the bed, almost out of the basement, as it is lacquer that snapped her back into the stomach where she belonged. The film feels almost completely surreal, as if we saw a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often has gags about the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the deathbed as their haven. The painter gives us a memory of all the different people who were eaten. There is really nothing like this movie anywhere, it is certainly one of a kind.
