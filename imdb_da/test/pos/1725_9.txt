I am a next generation of person ... I have never seen the original doctor, but I have heard of the series that constituted a great fan base in the past and still make its mark in the 21st century; the new "Doctor Who" started in 2005, but for those who live here in the US like me, we pretty much see it as new episodes on the sci-fi channel or BBC America; From season 1, we are introducing a new player Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and a beautiful, new, new physician played by Christopher Eccelson (mistakenly the first name regrets). these two go on some great and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world ... from time to time, the companions of Roses ex-girlfriend mickey have to the ever-present Jack Harkness (which can now be seen at the spin off "Torchwood" ). From season one to season two, the pace is just about right ... the stories can range from the incredibly strange to the most action-packed paced drive, but somehow it is a rollercoaster ride from the very beginning of the theme song, which is very captivating . In season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there may be some who say some of the season is not was so good, but I have to disagree and it was sad to see the rose and the doctor shares the roads, but it leaves the opening "companion" role to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helps continue the fight for saving humanity ... season three is now more at action / adventure level and sometimes at emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here is the relationship between the doctor and Martha appropriate but the attraction can be rushed at times, and the obvious is going to be the fact that she has not traveled Tyler because you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a a little awkward it was for me because you need to praise and her ways and now to see someone who sometimes does not ask the doctor at an emotional level, but the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers who keep you to the edge of your seat. All in all, it is a thrill ride on a TV show, I would give it more, but there are some flaws in this show, so good that I can't mention because sometimes it's hard to pick up but only one does the doctor and Martha's relationship is hurried and not smoothed to get to know you I've seen great shows on British television, but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience, but you don't need take my world for it ... step into the tardis and join the adventure.
