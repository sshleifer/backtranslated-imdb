Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes that reach the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get it laugh when Columbo does something lumpy and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder problems Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story of how Columbo solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is another good Columbo episode and I will rate it 7/10. It is close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just a question" - The acting? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
