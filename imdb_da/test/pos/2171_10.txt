Most other responses from subscribers to this service were very prone, though some found it slow or ambiguous confused. Instead of being ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as anti-war because of opening and closing scenes and the badly despised grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked like they were preparing for the great burden of Eylau as opposed to his so horrible and disturbing conclusion when we see the bloody uniforms, the filthy death, etc. - but above all, I see the film as a moral man in an immoral society. In the end, Chabert chooses retirement from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and chooses the simple pleasures that Derville (himself saved by his recognition of Chabert's basic decency and moral of his choice of renunciation) are - white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco - he leaves his wife and her and society's disgrace over the judges. In her case, we can see the film as feminist, in the position of women at the time when the only weapons Mme Chabert has are her charm, beauty, rest and ultimately money.
