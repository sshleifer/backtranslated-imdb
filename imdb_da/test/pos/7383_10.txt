This is one of my all-time favorite movies, it's great to see in groups I find. It's also good for any Alan Rickman fan, he does such a wonderful job. It's exciting, entertaining, very surprising ... you have to see it twice, at least. I haven't seen it with anyone who didn't like it or at least finds it worthwhile.
