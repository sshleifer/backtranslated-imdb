Barney is about "IMAGINATION", what you do not have if my preschooler would never play as if they were doing that show, so I would be concerned. What 2 or 3 years old actually gets everything that is still about the colors and the song. For those of you who say everything they do at Barney, eat junk food and recommend Sesame Street better, what about "cookie monster" that's all he eats, but I haven't seen anyone commenting on one. I agree that sesame is a better educational show, but barney is like a show of fun, not being too serious if you didn't like your child watching TV and worried about them understanding things you don't think So you shouldn't be propping them down in front of the tv in the first place because all it's fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have one problem with a fake TV show for children, then turn it off and play with themselves and teach them what you want them not to teach BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or Barney anyone who used to see all the shows and showed fine.
