The big dictator is a rude movie. Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely fun and witty and yet at the same time giving a strong statement in his satire against fascism. Chaplin's anti-Nazi speech at the end, with its values, is one of the great moments of film judgment. Throughout this movie, I felt that there was a higher form of intelligence than the real intelligent film creation in the workplace.
