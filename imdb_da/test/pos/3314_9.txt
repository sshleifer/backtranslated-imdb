After growing up in the writing desk and dealing with office politics and men who were inclined to make a feast of beauties for a nice meal day to day, this movie hit the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in, and I think it has done well and stopped over time. The best on the screen's kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. It does not seem that any of this is plausible, but in fact it was and probably still itself scared by sexual harassment. I thought the movie was well thrown, except Evans terrible behavior. What a fat ball, but he found his niche somewhere else. Apart from that, everyone got up to the plate.
