"Classe tous risques" feels like granddaddy of "The Sopranos" in the mix of criminal and domestic and compact films to feel as modern as "Reservoir Dogs." Although these gangsters are lovingly involved with wives, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless, and we are constantly reminded that they are no matter what warm situation we also see them in. They can cheat a child's hair - and then Shoot a threat in cold blood. The key is loyalty, and the male companionship is beautifully conveyed without ethnic or class serotypes, although their web of past commitments and repayments narrows in suspicion and paranoia, as the old gang is in different stages of parole, retirement, out on bail or new, lesser profitable ventures. An intense accusation is to send a stranger to perform an old escape scenario. It's a highlight of emotions when a wife is told she's not the gangster who's friends, while almost the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he reminds of his wife. <br /> <br /> Streetscapes in Italy and France are wonderfully used in dazzling daylight for dark water and highways from the opening of a pair of brazen robbers - traveling with his wife and two children. Robust, sharp Lino Ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal father. And the other divide is obviously a randomly unclear presence in their lives as they evenly coordinate theft and flight, in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles, in easy tandem. This is not the clich√© crusty old guy softened with the big eyes of orphans; These are their jobs and their families, and they cut in horrible ways. The film draws no blows in unexpectedly killing characters, direct and as security damage, and challenging our sympathy for them, all the way to the unentimental end, which was likely to be an American remake. <br /> <br /> It seems so fresh that it is only before Jean-Paul Belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the movie and looks so unclear as a young punk to realize that this is from 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has a smart and amazing chemistry with him, from an ambulance to a lift to a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> While the Film Forum showed a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles, it was not untouched. The program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is the saying of "tourist class".
