Although the wonderful soda in the local pharmacy no longer exists and the clothes are absolutely 1946 immediate postwar, and good and evil is easy to understand, and <br /> <br /> these old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. <br /> <br /> The human adaptations and troubles after the war, the beautiful <br /> <br /> love stories, the wonderful plays (especially Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) are who moved today in 2002 as they were in 1946. <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our fantastic <br /> <br /> World War II veterans. Like so many, my memories of the <br /> <br /> war years and homecomings are as fresh today as they were <br /> <br /> yesterday - this movie is very relevant to our times.
