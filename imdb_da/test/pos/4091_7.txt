The movie is excellent. Action, filmography, direction and music are spell binding. It seems to me that the reason for so many giving the film a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original 1937 version with Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - created an incredible commitment. From talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, I think the effect was somewhat akin to the first Starwars movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not worthy either. From the first scene, the 1973 edition takes you. Noise and tumult are amazing, especially in the way they prepare for the Shangri La's peace. And Burt Bacharach's music is beautiful. So - definitely enjoy the 1937 edition. But let it not detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version more than you would let 1935 King Kong destroy Peter Jackson this year.
