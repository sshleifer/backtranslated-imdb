"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies ever !!! I think I watched this movie many years ago on sennat tv with my mom when i was little and i thought it was so fun. This film was also referred to as a "black American graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is great as Exact Friend Cochise. There are also some other great characters in it, and this movie has a lot of humor wrapped up in it. From the beginning of the film, where Cochise goes to Preach's home to get ready for school for the sad end of Cochise's funeral, this movie is one that will make you laugh all the way. There are many scenes in this movie that I like a lot. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach and Cochise's friends) goes to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt (very rough but fun too), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quartet of this girl house that became a disaster because of a fight and some others are wonderful to see. This movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album filled with many amazing Motown hits and early 60's artists (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were performed in '75 while the rest were from the '60s). The movie is mainly about two friends who dream of getting away from their poor and rough neighborhood after high school, but their futures seem almost out of reach because of their innocent joy that goes into a stolen car that two other caps were responsible for, and exact relationship with, his girlfriend burns Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) almost at risk. Go and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a lot of comical entertainment !!! Also get the soundtrack. It is also very fun !!!
