While he was great in Boogie Nights, I think this was Burt Reynold's best performance. He is also a great instructor and has made a tough, violent film that does not hold back (a hooker's death by 12 gauge) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an excellent jazz soundtrack . 10 out of 10
