The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the origins of 1905 and establish the event as a heroic foreshadowing of the October Revolution in 1917. Ironically, the director of the film Sergei Eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential spokesmen for a formalistic approach to cinema. Subsequently, Eisenstone's formalism and suspect policy would cause countless conflicts with governmental bodies insisting on "socialist realism". Influenced by Russian film theorist, Lev Kuleshov and through him by DW Griffith's intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a "collision" of quickly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting and camera angle. Without doubt, the most memorable illustration of Eisenstone's stylistic approach - and probably the most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the "Odessa Steps" sequence in the Potemkin. In structure, the Potemkin is a "five reels" divided into five story parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama. In "Men and Maggots", Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction with the battleship's working class sailors, as the situation is inevitably based on mutiny. Even before the sailors and their top class officers / masters are introduced visually, Eisenstein establishes revolutionary relationships symbolically by collision editing of waves breaking violently and immensely at sea. On board the ship we experience overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the sailor's dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, hard labor and - most memorably - the spotted meat intended for the evening meal. The ship's nearsighted doctor is carried by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suited to be served with the dark soup that boils as the sailors' rage. In line with Marxist borders, the church also fails the men, and we see that one of them is smashing a record inscribed with words from the Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (perhaps the first conscious "cutting" of cinema history). <br /> <br /> Identified by inter-titles such as "Drama on Quarterdeck" and "An appeal from the dead", Potemkins second and third describes the actual mutiny and onshore burial of its leader and revolution's first heroes, Vakulinchuk . Unified by Vakulinchuk's appeal to the fraternity, the original mutants along with the entire crew are in an attack on the officers. A chaotic scene follows if violent passion is benefited by Eisenstone's editing methods. The officers' neighborhood is trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic intersections to the maggot-ridden meat and his spectacles meditatingly dangling in the rig. Tragically, the death of Vakolinchuk is the price paid for rebellion (no omelette without breaking eggs), and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and commit "Death to the oppressors". Fists and fists shake off the signal of revolutionary consciousness birth. The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and interim pictures on the staggering faces of various people on the coast and selected objects (parasol, glasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (spreading a title card in capital letters) stops the music, and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here, Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing, as nearly a hundred shots are blended together to contrast the panic chaos and victimization of the citizens with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving down citizens to the trampling horses and flying saber from the waiting cocks below. The Mise-en scene is framed by a statue of the emperor at the top of the staircase and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for Russian repressive institutions: Tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian Church. The punctuating sequence is two scenes involving mothers and children. Firstly, a mother and a young boy who had been introduced among the merry faces in the crowd, were among the first victims of the butcher. The boy is shot, but the mother continues to run until her face close-ups give her terrible glance at the fact that the son has fallen into the body that is being crowded. With a very slow editing tempo, the camera follows the mother as she carries the baby's lifeless body up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They shoot the sum of her dead. After this standstill, the carnage continues with a few more dozens until another mother is shot through the stomach (mother of mother Russia) as she tries to protect her baby in her cart. In a scene famous in The Untouchables, the cart slides down the stairs undisturbed. Frightened faces of huddled citizens see the slow progress towards its judgment. When the carriage reaches the bottom, there is a cut to a cossack that carries a sword, and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see: the slaughter of this pure and symbolic innocent. The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence are of three stone lions, one in pause, one sitting up and one roaring. The editing animates them to a visual metaphor of people's awakened anger. <br /> <br /> Some anticlimactic turns the fifth action back to the battleship as the mysterious seamen fly on the open sea and await a meeting with other ships from the fleet. They and the viewer expect retribution, but when the meeting arises, no shot is shot and instead all the sailors bow and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of companionship. Eisenstein rewrote the story at this time, as the revolution was not launched for another twelve years. Battleship Potemkin stands as one of the heavy works in the quiet film, and it retains extraordinary film power.
