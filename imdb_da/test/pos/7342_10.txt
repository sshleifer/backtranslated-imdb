Whatever you do, don't stop watching when you think the movie is over! Hang around for the first batch of credits or you will really miss something! We watched this movie at the Savanaah Film Festival and thought it was the best of the pile. Dreya Weber is really a wonder, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it out so far above the ground. At Q&A, she said there were no wires or effects, so all you see is really that she's after it. Addie couldn't make it to the festival because she danced with Madonna. She was excellent and my gawd was so beautiful. I was amazed that the movie went so well with the blue-haired ladies, but there you have it, Savannnah is not a backwater.
