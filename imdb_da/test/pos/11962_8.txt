Thus, "One Crazy Summer" starts the evil twin of "Better Off Dead ..". How can a movie be bad when opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total blast. Pair again John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time Bobcat adds Goldwaith to the mix that has good, fun results. Hyperactive Bobcat grinds the nerve of everyone around, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a fake military with pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As the interest of love, again, chronically depressed Cusack. <br /> <br /> The story is well, simple enough. Laughter is there, but both Savage Steve Holland movies have some quality for them ... they are funny, but they are also cute. The scene in which Curtis finds a blown doll in the target practice beach, and begins to mumble about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was stupid, funny and touching. The animation used throughout is quite surreal. The "boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sails and Odie plush doll). Overall, a fun movie, but not as good as "Better off dead ..."
