I really love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was working a video store. When I went to buy it, they told me it was out of print and I couldn't order it so I just thought I'd see it today. and then I found that they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy where it is in English and Spanish on DVD .... hope it helps ..... I know How hard it is to find movies that we love that they have not released to the US market. good luck. The more info here is a place to see .... http://www.zonadvd.com I think it goes for $ 10 usd on eBay too.
