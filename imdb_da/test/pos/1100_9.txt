I'm surprised there is confusion over the title of this movie. It is clearly a study of modern love. It suggests that love is love while the walk is good, but one where people reserve the right to sit first, and if it goes hard, they go out and go on something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications as it comes from Generation X, comments Generation X, and ultimately targets Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has transformed from what Baby Boomers has The parents of Generation X, had elicited in their marriages and family life, and which gave Generation X the innocent and lavish childhood it eventually had. <br /> <br /> Of course, Generation X's attitude towards love is flippant, but as decisions are made and commitments are broken, the biggest accident is the kids in Generation X. This is clear at the end of the movie and was so sharp I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
