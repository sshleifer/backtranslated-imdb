I never read the book, but had always heard good things about it. So when the movie came out, I considered seeing it, but it never did. Now it has come out on DVD, and I'm going to rent for a few weeks now. Last night I finally got up. I am very glad I did. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this movie. The scenery etc ... everyone made you feel like you were in Kabul. The action was all very good, although I'm sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good and clean and uplifting. Yes the story was very sad, but at the same time uplifting. <br /> <br /> And I will be honest, as a white American ... made me ignore Kabul and Afghanistan, as I never picture in my mind when I think about it. Showed me a Afghanistan before the Taliban. Showed me a place that was beautiful. Showed me a place with good-hearted people. I am a community that was like a family except a few bullies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the best I've ever seen.
