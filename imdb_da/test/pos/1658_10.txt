Initially, I have done further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this highly imaginative and diverse film noir crime movie. Second, this was a very low budget film created in the Renaissance of the film's first moment. Third, the jewels where the robbery was attempted were a real jeweler. The producers of Rififi asked them to film their surprise (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject "surprisingly for some not very obvious reason, they were very happy about the idea that a crime film was put in their store). <br /> <br /> It is impeccable signs and plot to fit so beautifully with their surroundings. To add to my praise, I would say this, some may say that this was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary putting the base on the solid plot of a Hollywood crime film. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this fresh idea of ​​a movie where not only one side wins and that side should not always be the good one. can I say that a movie is not predictable! Ten stars!
