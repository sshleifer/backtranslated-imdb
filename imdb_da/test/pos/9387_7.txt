Death bed: The bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet there is much more (background) history for this movie, so one suspects. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the main drawing is about a bed and people eating, but there are also a few subplots. I don't want to spoil them for you, but they are a good touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the actor in this movie is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues are not even spoken by the actors does not really help improve the quality of the film as a whole. Because there are many voice-over work. The characters' thoughts are also revealed to the viewers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The effects are fine. Sure, it can be much better if you compare it to today's movie. But you shouldn't. Just judge the movie as it is, and don't take it too seriously. You must admit that a murderer BED is completely creative. If you're easily spooked, don't watch this movie. You may never sleep again ... Death Bed: The bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget, but I still recommend it to fans of horror movies. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for its creative history and unexpected twists here and there.
