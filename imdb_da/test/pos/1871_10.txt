One of the best sitcoms to drive on Indian TV along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar is out. Great acting, well paced and an extremely fun script made this a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the infinite Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what to expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped moving it. I wish Indian television would return to series like these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television, which is all good for those days. Anyone who is found by really good comedy should go and get this series. You might also enjoy a couple of Pakistani sitcoms like ups and downs and aik aur which are probably comparable to India's best.
