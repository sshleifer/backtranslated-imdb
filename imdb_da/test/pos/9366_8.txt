Edward Dmytryts' "Crossfire" is a rare movie that comes from Hollywood in the 1940s. This was groundbreaking area for Mr. Dmytrykt and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel, where the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you don't see the movie, please stop reading now. <br /> <br /> Richard Brook's novel was about killing a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was converted to prejudice against Jews, a theme that was taboo during that time in the American cinema. It is Mr Dmytrit's credit to have the courage to get involved in this film project at all. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent piece of film making because the way the director presents it. Of course, influenced by film noir style, we are taken to the postwar Washington. The opening scene of the brutal murder of Samuels shows that such an unusual cruelty is being brought to a decent man whom we do not know yet, or why has been killed but which did not deserve to die in such a terrible way. <Br /> <br /> The basis of the murder is prejudice, clean and simple. We realize how in an ignorant person's mind, the only fact of being successful and different is playing in the mind of murder. Samuels stands as the sacrificial lamb, just as the homosexual is the victim of the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This movie makes convincing viewing because of the brilliant star swing of Robert Ryan, like Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as good as in "Crossfire". There is also a good look of Gloria Grahame, like Ginny, the prostitute with her heart in the right place. The rest of the cast plays as an ensemble. Robert Young, the police detective who is in charge of the investigation, is a decent man who has known prejudices first hand in his own family and speaks loudly to it. Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. Keeley, deeply affected by the crime, when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene is excellent in his little role Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch because of the first one to speak loudly to ignorance.
