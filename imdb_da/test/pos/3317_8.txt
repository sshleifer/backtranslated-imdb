Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) just kills time getting a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and get a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay so far long ago and fall in love with a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are convicted of drama in 'The Best of Everything', a 1959 soap opera / moral game / sometimes solid movie that ages in the other. <br /> <br /> Set in the rugged world of paperback publishing, it's not as rough as the Dollar Valley, but not as vanilla as "Three Coins in the Fountain." <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are licked, well-dressed and not good, mostly. Aherne is the resident sexual offender - will pinch everything that goes by and make unwanted progress right and left. His character is offensive as hell, but it is not played seriously at all. The harassment had not been discovered yet, I think. Boyd also works there, even if you never see him actually doing anything. He is too busy getting older, smarter and drunken. Evans is abroad just as Diane Baker likes in style - he is a nice child who has got her in 'trouble' so instead of marrying her as promised, he takes her to get an 'operation' . <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker. They share a battle scene that is rather unobtrusive, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is ultimately destroyed by Parker's histronics. She almost ends up stealing him, and she really did not deserve such a miserable fate, her bad act, though. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes as Amanda Farrow, the resident witch who is automatically rude and dismissed by any of her legions of secretaries. Now they're younger, aren't they? Isn't it enough reason to hate a person? Caroline doesn't believe it, as she admires Miss Farrow, every chance she gets. Crawford only gets rid of once when she tells her married married boyfriend 'can you your rabbit-face wife both go to hell' and slam down the phone. You will never see the poor soul who dares to cross her. <br /> <br /> Martha Hyer's 'story', as it was, is extremely weak, and she is painfully top-notch as an unmarried mother. In short, having a big "W" (for "whore") on her cardigan, she goes around as a pathetic mess for most of her screen time. Even worse, she does not get the courtesy of having everything 'tied up' on one side or the other, at last. It doesn't matter so much, but still .. It is painfully obvious, all this took place in a completely different world. People were nicer to each other for the most part, and the work was not a move but something exciting for a girl outside of NYC anyway. A convincing drunk scene aside, helps Hope Lange, it seems reasonably real as Caroline, who at least has more than one page for her character. <br /> <br /> I admire women having an opinion, a chance and a choice. Not that it is not wrapped in a nice bow, but it gives some points for equality. In 1959, it was probably remarkable and possibly controversial. 10.7.
