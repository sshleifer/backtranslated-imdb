Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic event "Wind and the Lion" is a very good adventure movie in the deserts of Africa. <br /> <br /> El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman (Candice Bergen) and her two children to get some concessions for his country out of US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) . From this simple plot, John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> The outdoor intelligence, impressive color photography, very well-managed action sequences and perfect settings make the image a kind of epic one with an undeniable sense of grandeur. The musical score is also remarkable and therefore fits. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as the Arab leader and proves he can handle almost any role. Then Candice Bergen is like the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances, but deep in fear and has her weaknesses; She gets to admire Connery and even understands his completely different focus on life due to their very different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles ever as US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Most entertaining and very good movie sample in the genre. Give it a try, you won't regret it.
