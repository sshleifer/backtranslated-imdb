I always wanted to watch this movie, and when I finally got there, I knew I was in a good surprise when John Boorman's name came on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) in the classic Hollywood structure, this one fits nicely with his catalog. Nor can I express how perfect that time was to consider Myanmar (Burma) again experiencing a rebellion of monks and students against the military "junta" government that is the same (there has been a change of leadership since but it is pretty much the same as depicted in the 1988 film. Now more than ever, this movie has to be broadcast on TV (captured on IFC) because of recent events.
