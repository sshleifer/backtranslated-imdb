What great movie was this? Is that the sky? hell? or something? I disagree with many reviews of this movie that say this is a picture of hell. It is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end. Furthermore, it is not clear that the protagonist goes to hell, but perhaps in between. The review I read about IMDb says this is hell, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Consider that perhaps good people who commit suicide must not be condemned to hell ... the only religious belief. This is actually a thinker and I have / would recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of movie. Definitely worth it!
