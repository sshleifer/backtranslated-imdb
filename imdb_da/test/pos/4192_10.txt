Forget about Easy Rider - Head is the 1960s movie. <br /> <br /> Almost laughing: when Monkees reduces their entire career to one minute TV commercial about scales! See: The 50-foot Victor Mature is trying to figure out what he thinks he's doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his pet shoes on leash) tell Davey Jones "Your music is horrible white"! Experience: Monkee's only live performance as a true rock band plays the honest-to-gosh first real punk rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: When Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Confused: Be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is, when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual inductance about her in her movie debut! Witness: In vain protests against the Vietnam War leaps out of nothing and just as quickly disappears! Watch: Mike Nesmith spit on Christmas while wearing a velvet Victorian smoking jacket in a spider's gothic horror movie sound scene! Let yourself drive: into the karmic bliss inspired by a cartoon version of Indian mystery delivered by a hammy white character actor in black-face, while Peter Tork pretends to know how to play a guitar! Experience: Oscar Prize Winner Bob Rafelson's First Feature Length Film, written by Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson! Don't pretend to happen: When the monks commit suicide in the group by jumping over the Golden Gate Bridge! Take medicine - take a lot of drugs: Take as many drugs as the throw and the crew obviously did while you made this movie! With Head unveiling, Monkees revealed himself as the most ardent, slickest entertainers in Hollywood's history, none carried. It is confusing to discover that they blamed the mistake of this movie on bad promo. To be sure, promotion was almost non-existent; but did they not know how angry how depressed, how self-destructive this movie is? I mean, this movie is a trip - on poor acid - to the suicide department of a mental hospital. The only movie I know to be this depressing is Terry Gilliams Brazil; And like Brazil, this film reveals why life in the last 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It is not just that Western culture suffers from serious information overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more bad and gloomy. In fact, it was the actual congestion effect that kept people going as it made it possible for people to distract themselves with a crisis or another - if the news from Vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and see a documentary about the rising The positive reaction to the reality revealed in the head was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend nearly kills Abbie Hoffman . Everything goes behind a steel fence under the lovingly watchful eyes of a true army of NY State Troopers - meaning the "freedom" of the Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while he was so excited that he hardly could speak. "500,000 assholes are too stupid to get out of the rain," was a critic's judgment on Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The one good thing that occurred was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years earlier, Jimi Hendrix Experience had gone on their first national tour of America, which the heating band opens for - Monkees. <br /> <br /> See, it's all connected in some way. You owe it to yourself - no, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s that are only on film in this bizarre, miraculous and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams from it later 20th century.
