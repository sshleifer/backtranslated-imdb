Lou Gossett, Jr. is great as 'Chappy Sinclair', a super US Air Force pilot who is going to save a nice but undefeated Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick), a trapped pilot determined to lend a pair of F-16 fighters to to use in an attempt to save his father from a dictator (David Suchet) of a hostile overseas country. <br /> <br /> Better than 'Top Gun', this air force flight movie thrills and lots of explosions - you know all the cool you want from a modern military adventure movie. <br /> <br /> Cool music, including Twisted Sisters Dee Snider, calling out, "We don't take it" and King Cobra's excellent 'Never Say Die'. <br /> <br /> Measure high! Air Force!
