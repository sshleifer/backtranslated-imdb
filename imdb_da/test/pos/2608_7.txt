This is a cute movie starring Spanky, Alfalfa and Boghev from the "Our Gang" comedies. Seen in the south during the Civil War, it may seem a little strange to see buckwheat as Spanky's slave, but this movie is as charming as the best shorts with the same casting. This was the only Our Gang feature film, and I highly recommend The Little Rascals 1994 remake.
