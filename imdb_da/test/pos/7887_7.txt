Unusual movie about a man who turns to his social opposite out of fear of extortion. Peter Boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class rigid "Joe" in love with the past and horrible for the future and worried about the present. The first half hour of the show includes the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon like Melissa Compton, a weakly willing rich girl who slumbering with her losing girlfriend, filled with a full nude scene. Her boyfriend is the weak spot of the movie, a poorly portrayed addict and dealer who meets his death after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet with Boyle's Joe in a bar as he spits out and shouts about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that the later Norman Lear TV character Archie Bunker is based on a cleared version of Joe. The comparison even goes to Joe's wife and personal life and pastime. Joe sees herself in Bill Compton's life, Melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely couple as they seek Melissa, who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends. Their search leads them to an "oar-gee", as Joe calls it, a free love festival with drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe both appear together. They are being robbed and it leads to a violent and murderous ending that shifts the sharp and chilling end to taxi driver six years later. Joe is a fun movie that is anti-violence and anti-racist at least on the surface. Yet, the film's main character, Joe, becomes the instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and goes into the illegal and outrageous sexual profits he opposes. So in that respect the film lacks a strong message and leaves you wondering what the final result was really about.
