I saw this episode many times because I didn't understand how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to save their innocent, a doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look at The Book of Shadows, while Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws an energy ball on the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way, and Prue hits the chest with it and smashes against the wall, the same with Piper. So Phoebe comes down and says the spelling, as only Phoebe said it, and not only the power of three Shax was only hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Phoebe entered the Underworld to find Cole, while Prue and Piper seek Shax on the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper using her power to blow up Shax, meanwhile, a new reporter has got it all on tape. So it's brand new about the three strong Halliwell sisters, while Phoebe doesn't know anything because she's still in the Underworld. There are Repots and people all over the Halliwell House. Then a madman enters the house and says, "Can I be part of your cow?" and Prue says "No this is our house coming out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. As madman comes out of the house and cries and says "That means witches". The maniacet gets so angry that she shoots Piper straight through her stomach. Prue comes in her car and hills to go to the hospital, but people won't let her through, so Prue uses her powers to move people out of the way and get people to kill her more. They came to the hospital, but Piper didn't. Meanwhile, Phoebe in Underworld. Hoebe finds out that they have been postponed so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse the time. Source says he will only be about time if Phoebe promises to stay in The Underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says "What would make him think I'd make a deal like that?" and then Cole says, "So you can save one of your sister's lives." Leo goes to the hospital to find out that Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe that it's true. Then Phoebe accepts to remain only if Cole wants to return to warn Piper and Prue about the exponent and death of Piper. Back at the hospital SWAT is about the gunpowder, but the other one before they are done is the time left when they were in the yard with the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call Leo to cure Prue and Piper, so the doctor throws in the wall too. The doctor died, and so did Prue. But that's what I didn't get if Piper was throwing against the wall too, how did Prue only die? Why didn't they show Leo to come and heal Piper and Leo trying to cure Prue? If you know the answer, please email me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I like Paige and I'm happy the show continued
