Saw this movie as it was a recording at the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy film! The depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another external level could have left me to the extreme if it hadn't been too much fun synagogues and dialogue along the way to ease the overall tone of the movie. The relatively "uplifting" end gave hope to those who were hit by the original tragedy. Still I didn't get out of the theater ready to go to a fun party. The movie stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Bringing memories of "Ordinary People" but with humor blended into the tragedy. I thought the play was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. How each character was about the tragedy was sometimes sad, self-covering, but also sometimes fun. Smart dialogue and situations.
