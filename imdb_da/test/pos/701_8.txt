I liked this Western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.It has just about everything a Western should have. there are fighting fortresses, actions, hunting for horseback. It's a bit of a romance angle that is suggested. There is some good comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character pretending to be a doddering old fool but is actually aware of everything going on. Randolph Scott plays the city's sheriff, and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways. I liked the different mix of characters in the movie. I didn't always find it fast, but I never found it boring either. Although the film is in 1943, it is in color. 8.10
