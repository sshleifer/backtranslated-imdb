I've already commented on this movie under the name of BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I will add something! Now after a long time I have seen many so-called heroic blood exits titles! But not many come close to the action shown in John Woo movie! Therefore, after all these years, I think it's strange that "China White" doesn't get the credit it deserves! No matter what version you have seen! The action is top notch! The landscape, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You get the impression it is a great district. But having lived in Amsterdam myself, I know that it is only a small area that is part of the Red Light District, which happens to have many Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they shot the film, it actually looks like a big and important area where people know they can't row with the triads (Chinese mafia)! Besides the action "China White" is a compelling gangster drama with some good actors! For this I must give credit to Russel Wong! Too bad we don't see much of him lately, as he has many options! Must watch movies!
