This movie won a special award in Cannes to shop and it's not hard to see why. (A couple of spoilers - but eventually you'll see the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the war night between Russia and Germany in World War II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov), but they have a spit, when she learns that he has been attracted to the army. Boris leaves the cover before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot, but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, rape Veronika, who feels obligated to marry him. Buried and dimmed by the cowardly Mark, Veronika adheres to the hope that one day Boris will return. Excellent camera work and amazing set pieces by director Kalatozov. (For everyone interested in film technology is another movie by Kalatozov, I am CUBA, at least two amazing sets of pieces - one of them a long track shot that starts with a funeral process through the Havana streets, raises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks through the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Excellent acting, especially by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris's uncle), made more attractive by pure understatement. A devastating romantic film with a heart-stopping performance of Samoilova. (This film is often associated with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
