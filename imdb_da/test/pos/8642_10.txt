The story of the case of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should have been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') in the rival field of television series ended abruptly after finishing the pilot. It was too risky and angry for manufacturers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to complete a brand new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinematic experiences of this decade that can be ranked among David Lynch's best works. His former film 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' was kept in an annoying way, which hung the viewer in the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot that happens here. /> <br /> 'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle game where pieces are missing, others are obviously taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. On the internet I encountered a lot of instructions and essays to explain this movie. I realize it's losing its magic when you try to completely decipher it. All the detailed solution explanations are not only waste, but also the dubious attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A young child dissects his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific bear are. Is it because it will ruin its toys? Is the secret in teddy bear or actually in the child's heart? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' This means that innocence is one of the most important things to see and appreciate. <br /> <br /> David Lynch not only manages to look at the surface of human behavior, but also to grasp everything under it. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that remains unspoken; feelings that are often suppressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' Having the intensity requires a casting that completely addresses the problem of the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the director's selfless vision.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solves their task in such an impressive way that you will not or cannot imagine another cast. Although their appearance at first seems to be a little overlaid, you will soon realize that this stereotype is set for the purpose of manipulating the viewer and confusing him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criterion of a well-made movie, you can lose yourself and dive into what you see on the screen than Lynch managed to make a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests David Lynch's status as one of today's most important, creative and courageous directors. Like any film producer that goes beyond the borders, he faces criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's movie world. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeping ?? It is a must see for anyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that separation had hardly been ventured before.
