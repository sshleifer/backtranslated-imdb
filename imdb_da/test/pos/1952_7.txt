Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (like Tim) throws his sister's doll in the river, while Daniel Roebuck (like Samson) laughs and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (like Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays at "River's Edge" for any passerby to see. Seeing the dead body is a group of twenty any teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked body. Stoners Keanu Reeves (like Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are most camera-worthy. Friends wonder what to do about their guilty, beer-guzzling killer friend. <br /> <br /> Veteran-in-the-cast Dennis Hopper (like Feck) keeps the youths heads fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of the six-size dolls in lifestyle, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (like Clarissa) is a more vivid doll and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is especially cross-cut with a flashback to the opening string. An actual teenager, in her first dragon role, is Mrs Leitch's daughter of the sixties singer Donovan. Make other distinctive connections on your own. <br /> <br /> Depending on your mood, you can read a lot in the movie or not. Some of the character's backgrounds may be a bit too subtle. Most obviously, the killer was tormented; note his weight, attitude and "toilet" -connected nickname. Some of the character's relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly holds the material interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and author Neal Jimenez are of course skilled. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (8/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
