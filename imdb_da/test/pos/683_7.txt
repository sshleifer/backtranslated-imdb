I saw the first thing as a child (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on the TV year I was born) and recently bought it on DVD. Meanwhile, I saw it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes to 1) The cake itself fought and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a nubian slave, such as. Voodoo. I think Roach and McGowan would have been killed if they had tried to do so now. Note how the pie is fighting in The Three Stooges 'HALFWITS' HOLIDAY and in SWEET PIE and PIE looks like this one ... and this movie came out a couple of years before their original contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Of course there was some inspiration from the SS and Laurel & Hardy's BATTLE OF THE CENTUR for these movies ... keep in mind that they all stole everyone from the best, each other !!! <br /> <br /> Another note: Laurel & Hardy buffs, the bake sales lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in the TBOTC "flap" came into her car and got it in the back. It always escapes me why she was never credited?
