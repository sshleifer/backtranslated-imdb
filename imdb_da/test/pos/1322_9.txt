It has taken more impressions for me to fully appreciate this movie. At first I was hit by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow and dull. I thought that such a sensational issue needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production of Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are repeated and dramatized by similar themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that is what finally made the difference to me. Still feels that the movie may be a little tighter and warmer, but it is truly unique and deserves serious attention. Love the fact that the Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. The Philip Glass score is fascinating.
