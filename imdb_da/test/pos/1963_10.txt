I just watched this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid 90s as a Vanguard Video committee. It has retained that power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two are the launch tape for two exciting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three have it Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit / psychotic character roles. <br /> <br /> The movie is also a study of how people work in different settings. You have signs in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general social settings, etc. History makes it good to demonstrate how a person will act in each setting. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find the details of the actual murder to compare with the movie. I saw a short bit that showed that it happened in California and that several schoolmates were taken to see the body. <br /> <br /> This is a great choice for a rainy night video rental. Be prepared to feel unshakable at the end.
