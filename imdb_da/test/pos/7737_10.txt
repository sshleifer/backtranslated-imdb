Cheers to all the fantastic fans of this movie who have not only seen and appreciated it, but (based on the many literary comments) GET IT! I've always seen Paul Mazursky's "Tempest" a musing on the Shakespeare game of the same name as it has been noticed in some of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more simple customization of the game, you should look elsewhere. However, as an experiment, it only succeeds spectacularly. Charming, moving, fun, sad, dramatic ... it's all and much more. Cast, places, script, music are just amazing. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. Susan Sarandon is more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her movie debut memorable and you just love Raul Julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes. In addition, they were always big Cassava's confident and assured another performer to let him! A study of what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic might be like, if updated to more "modern times", Mazursky's "Tempest" burns brilliantly!
