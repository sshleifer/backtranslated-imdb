I remember looking at the police team! When it first came to ABC in 1982, and I thought it was a very fun show, thanks to the many sight gags, non-sequitors and scripts filled with word games. In an episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ABC has canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer period, but a network manager thought the show required too much attention from the viewer because of all the synagogues in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening, where the title of the episode was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen's depiction of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very fun and his role was in the storytelling of Jack Webb from Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible was not bad as Norberg, but the one character that stood out was Johnny Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> Although the Police Squad! had a short lifetime on ABC, Zucker Brothers did not give up on the concept, which proved even more successful in the Naked Gun movie movie. I close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the finish right here.
