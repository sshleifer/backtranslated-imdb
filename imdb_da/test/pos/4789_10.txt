Every time this movie used to re-air on television in the late 70's and early 80's, I would always have time to sit in front of the television and watch it. To see the lovely Kate Jackson, beautiful Richard Long, the "big" Polly Bergen, whom I have never seen anywhere other than this television movie, the avid Tom Bosley and another "great" I have never seen outside this movie, Celeste Holme. This is really a love boat on a cruise to murder and chaos and boy was it ever good !! And every time I wanted to see it, I'd always forget who the real killer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, anyone here already criticizes the movie as if it really is a great help to anyone. This is a great movie and worth seeing every time. I can't say about half the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to watch it on TV one day, which is unlikely to see it. In the light of "The Girl Most Likely To", which finally comes out this year on DVD, there may be hopes for a DVD release of "Death Cruise."
