I cannot argue with other comments that the line of history focuses more on the romance between Mary Martin and the Allan Jones characters, much like "Showboat" than on Victor Herbert's life. But in the 1930s would it have been a box office draw? Instead of VH's life, it might have been VH's music. There is an abundance of this. <br /> <br /> For me, the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie, when Susanna Foster sings "Land of Romance". It's been over a decade since I caught this movie for once at a local 'old movies' theater. Initially, the audience was stunned; then it burst into spontaneous applause. I can remember that tremors run up and down the back. My trivia memory recalled the information to a questioning public by a local journalist when the film came out again in the late 1930s. "The note hit by Miss Foster was a long F over high C." She may not have had four octaves at Yma Sumac, but the then teenager had decided a number!
