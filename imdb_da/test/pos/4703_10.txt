I went to a screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was ripped off by the people in this documentary. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen's amazing soul and took me to a world unknown. I was thoroughly satisfied with the journey and was completely hit by the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie speaks to those who want another chance in life.
