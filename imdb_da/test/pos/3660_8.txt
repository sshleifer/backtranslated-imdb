I was so happy to hear that Hari Om will finally be released in theater in 2007. I watched this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and have been waiting for that release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India .... colorful, magical, thoughtful. Apart from a slightly weird Hollywood-style auto rickshaw hunting scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie, but it has drama and romance and humor. The interaction between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist is a good reflection on the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a bit wide drawn, but the play was very good. Visually, this movie is a treat that you really get a sense of what is going through Rajasthan is like ... dreamlike. Sometimes it's hard to believe everything you see and experience is genuine ... the movie has the same quality. Amazing soundtrack too!
