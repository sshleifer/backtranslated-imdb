I was expecting a lot from this movie and I can say that I have not been disappointed. First of all, as a world wine making tournament, this film makes the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The interviewees are also interesting and fun, especially Hubert de Montille. The recording can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the background. You may not like it, but I do not consider it a defect. <br /> <br /> The themes raised in the movie can also be confusing as globalization is not the only issue being discussed. But Nossiter managed to give his film consistency all the time. A great achievement of this movie reveals all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are and avoids a clich√© "Good Against Evil". This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore's documentaries; Nossiter's view is shown in a subtle way, through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The ridge of this documentary is mainly dependent on the characters, the history of prolonged wine-making families, such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the viewer find that wine is somehow related to families, rather than just being a business and an industry. This movie will not allow you to drink wine, but it will make you discover vineyards and wine producers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a student of Enology, and let's just be there in many ways to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical characteristics.
