First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from Belgium) may add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user actually saw the movie, the message was that he was not a communist, but pigeonholed (by none other than Belgium, the United States, the United Nations, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals, businesses, and countries' political and economic gains. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in "revisionist history", it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was communist, especially from the country that "gave" the Congo independence, and when Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATIC to his seat as Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> On film ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and strongest movies I've seen for some time. Dismissal of the fight of the African freedom fighter, and ELECTED Prime Minister's struggles as his first leader, Mr. Peck, does a pretty commendable job of gathering all the pieces in one work. And it must have been quite a task. Due to the fact that most people outside Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and Congo outside of any easy coverage of African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school (or perhaps university / college class) history classes he had his work cut out for him. <br /> <br /> And to believe that Oliver Stone's "JFK" took over 3 hours, "Lumumba" runs for 2 hours. And the most engaging 115 minutes was when we found out that his desire not to compromise on the Western forces (as he is responsible for the atrocities of his people, especially Belgium), while trying to deal with power struggles within For his own borders, even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST look for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. You will not be disappointed.
