This is an important historical film, as it was the first all-talk movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was made for just $ 23,000. It broke over a million dollars at the release. <br /> <br /> This movie all contributed to defining the gangster melodramas that were to become bread and butter from Warner's studio in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie ended the silent era more than the more famous part-talkie predecessor, Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not as a simple footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor who may remember today is in Eugene Palette.
