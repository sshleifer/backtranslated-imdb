The cinema's greatest period began in post-war Europe with Italy's neo-realistic movement. Over the next two or three decades that followed, France's new wavers got everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his deserted Scandinavian island somewhere where he made bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, the Luchino Visconti brought the art form in full circle, geographically with its miraculous work * Death in Venice *, which might as well be called * Death of Europoean Cinema *. After the 1960s, the major European filmmakers who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted, passed the torch to a new American generation of film brats (Coppola, Scorsese & Co.). This film feels quite like a great summary, not only of Visconti's special occupations, but of the general effort of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal of film. And be sure you won't find any sterner taskmaster than Visconti revealed here. He does not play for the crowd, people: either you come behind him and follow or you are left behind. Pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are few and far between, but each seems to be burdened with symbolic significance in a strong and eerie cosmos. <br /> <br /> We will probably never be in such a rare company again for the movies: one of the great writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers who instruct it ( Visconti), one of the biggest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde) and swells almost continuously in the background, Gustav Mahler 5. Symphony. With the full benefit of Mahler's ability to inspire the romance of even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the protagonist Aschenbach to a distinguished composer from his original persona as a writer, and makes Bogarde look like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck similar walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably the greatest appearance of an actor in the film's story: it's a virtually silent performance, and the actor must deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or gaze - a tricky trick without curling Chaplin or just seems like an animated body. <br /> <br /> Cinema just doesn't get any better than this. I will ignore the complaints of the Ritalin abusers out there who say it is too slow, but even the more legitimate grasp of some of Aschenbach's backlinks with his antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The feedback fits nicely into the film's thematic concerns (ie, what better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And these disturbances and scourge serve to prevent sleepiness among viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep in this movie anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be more than a beautiful picture; But this movie is actually about something. And what it most concerns is to like: Romantic (capital R) suffers, especially. As a passion romantic, Visconti even knew where he was talking. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I guess] If you see nothing else * Death in Venice * for its portent opening opening credits. . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair color dripping from his sweaty dying head and on his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, the young Tadzio, who is the subject of Bogarde's dying desire, lies in the sea and points to the horizon as a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic order, with disturbing economics, is all that the film is about: love, desire, beauty, loss, the end of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a miraculous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece * The Damned *, I recommend turning on the English subtitles while watching this movie. It is apparently in English, but the sound of the DVD seems muddy and there is much Italian spoken under the film, anyway.] <br /> <br />
