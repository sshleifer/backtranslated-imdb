When a group of escaped judges manage to flee to a remote island, they quickly find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely threatening physician (Richard Johnson of "Zombi 2" fame), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The progenitors say the doctor has created grotesque half-human, half-fish creatures for evil and secretive purposes. And first, the prisoners do not believe this, as they disappear, one by one, they begin to change their mind. "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep". There are lots of gore with really cool decapitated scene and neck tear to increase. The action is fifty, but the movie is fast and entertaining. Give it a look.8 out of 10.
