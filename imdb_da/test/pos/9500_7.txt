Don't change your husband is on the one hand the beginning of a series of light marital comedies by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other, it is his first image for the star Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress in the quiet era, and is the movie that made her a star. Although the old DeMille formula began to change, and his film became more accurate and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer like Swanson, we regain much of the quiet style narrative style. Her character does very little, but does it convey volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions? with a special talent for appearance of contempt. In fact, Swanson came to the end of his disastrous marriage with Wallace Beery and it is possible that this fact drives her convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As if best complementing his leading lady talents, DeMille's use of framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. He uses film technology to show reality ?? often hold Swanson in long close-ups at important moments ?? and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when we are introduced to Toodle's character, she is shown three times in a blackboard with a mirror. Her character disappears from history, only to become important towards the end. The attentive grip of her first shot helps us remember who she was. Later in the anniversary dinner, Swanson and future husband number two Lew Cody are framed together in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own frame. Also ?? And this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general? there is much use of reaction shots ?? for example, the bishop's deviant glance when Cody behaves his intentions with the wedding dancers. Contrary to DeMil's visual narrative method, his collaborator Jeanie Macpherson was an increasingly comprehensive writer. As I have noted in several other comments, Macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, she used to set her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. And then we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the married life's pitfalls, which if they improve the story at all, it is only because they are inadvertently fun. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could come up with a line like "Fate lurks sometimes at Christmas". Fortunately, in this picture, most of the introduced scenes are instead of breaking them up. <br /> <br /> Although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small, at this time DeMille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. You can see him start sneaking in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz as Swanson's little fantasy scenes are broken with "Pleasure, wealth and love". It would not be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical images were lifted that he would have the chance to go out with the big play. All in all, don't change your man's a pretty decent DeMille style, though it is honestly only the presence of Gloria Swanson that averages above average. It is curious, although this is apparently a comedy, and Swanson was partially cast because of her background at Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. She hated comedy acting, and here it gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance. It makes sense when the only straight drama she did with DeMille, Man and Woman, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.
