As a dedicated lover of all Egyptian, this is a classic piece from the 50s along with my other favorite, Pharaoh's Land. "The sets and colors are just wonderful and everything seems so" nice "in the production quality. Victor Mature was well thrown and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I haven't yet seen the 1999 movie "The Mummy, but am sure I will love it!). <br /> <br /> Top stuff!
