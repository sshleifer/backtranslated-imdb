This film is a story of a Catholic nun as a counselor to convicted killer on the death row. The film describes what she does as a nun who has no productive role. She may have had doubts in her actual role. But in the end she plays the role that only a nun can do that only has faith in Christ. In America, there are so many films describing condemned criminals or prisons. These scenes, especially execution, are too much different from Japan.
