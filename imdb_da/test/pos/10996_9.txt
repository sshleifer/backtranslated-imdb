I would recommend this movie to anyone seeking a relaxing, fun, thought-provoking movie. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but that's probably because I live a short distance from there. Nevertheless, this film could be produced in any city; That is the theme that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven fell on us. Try it ... you will like it!
