Graphics are far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to the subway. It deserves strong love. It's a crazy game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters ... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted correctly. And even though graphics suck, it doesn't make a game good. In fact, the graphics were good at that time. Today, the graphics are crap. SO WHAT? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, yes. (You come to Canada in THPS3) Now I don't know if they say it, but they can. who knows. Now Canadian people can. Wait a moment, I get out of the subject. This game rocks. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. It's PURE BRILLIANCE.
