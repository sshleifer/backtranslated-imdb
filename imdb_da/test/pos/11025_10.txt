Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the company. It is beyond me why they have not received more recognition than they have. This film is a perfect example of how their boundaries are limitless. <br /> <br /> Performing the lives of people who can be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their specialty, and if those signs are not odd, I'm at a loss to find someone who is. The story is fun, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the end, but if I didn't, I wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. So there you go.
