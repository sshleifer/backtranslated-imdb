This is one of those movies where you have to put some of its obvious shortcomings (a result of the date and location of its production) and highlight the positives. In many ways, this is a truly amazing movie. Forgive parody in a line's summary, but the most serious lack of an English speaker like me was the horrible subtitle. The phrase I saw had 1982 Soviet "Movie Export" subtitles which consistently used inverted grammar, presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech. The real effect of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at the pictures. Considering that film films are this film of great strength, this is a real problem. Other IMDB niches have written lots about the Stalinist propaganda elements in this movie (only if the viewer doesn't feel them for themselves). They have also written many about the battle on the ice stage, which is fantastic in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The love interest lacks almost entirely subtlety and even strangely ..... almost completely lacking charm too. But it's good to ring every now and then. <br /> <br /> I was familiar with the Prokofiev music for this movie long before I saw the movie. The pictures and music complement each other wonderfully. And these are the pictures that will hold onto the mind for a long time. Bergman clearly learned much of these images - the image of his medieval pieces (eg The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring), which builds on and enhances Eisenstone's ideas. This film was made in 1938 in the Soviet Union. In this context, it is a masterpiece, though a flawless one. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on the show.
