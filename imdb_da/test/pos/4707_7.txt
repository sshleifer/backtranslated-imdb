I would give this movie a good strong 7. Although it is definitely not the biggest movie or even the best movie of that kind (The Killings Fields is better), at least it tries to tell a necessary story. <Br /> <br /> I think the method of introducing Laura into Burma was a little constructed. First of all, Burma is not exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 80s. Secondly, if you did it to Burma, your passport would not be lost. A healthy person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at any time. With that in mind, I'm sure the scriptwriter knew it was weak, but needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was discreet, and I just didn't buy her as a doctor. But at least she did not exceed the role that often happens in movies like this. U Aung Ko was good, but also discreet. The end is hard to follow as most of the dialogue is in Burmese, where people translate into Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura and it is also difficult for the viewer. Another plus is the strong SE Asian nature in the movie, which was fun to watch.
