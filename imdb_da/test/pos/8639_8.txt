Wow, what a weird movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's not surprising that it's strange. <br /> <br /> I defy anyone for completely explaining everything in this movie. I can't be done. After some research after my second viewing of this movie, I know pretty much most of the story, but on a first look, and without the help of other reviewers or without help, it's hard to figure things out. So if you're in that boat and were confused, don't feel bad; it's normal. Let me just say the key to the movie is Naomi Watts character. <br /> <br /> In any case, I find the movie fascinating. I love the wonderful visual and rich colors and find every character in this movie really different and fun to see. The camera work is excellent and the music is scary, a la Lynch's "Blue Velvet". There are also some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. All in all, it is very well scored. As Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series, this was a movie where the end was pieced together since Lynch thought this movie would be a long drawn-out television series. When that didn't happen, he ate at the last minute this end. It may take into account part of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations of characters we see earlier in the movie, but which mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is apparently a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does for people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are shattering. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the second leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to see, especially in their famous lesbian sex scene. Appearance, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie more on display than the first one. It's not just a piece of curiosity; it's a very exciting movie ..... just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.
