This movie was anything but boring. It's about reality. To the people who think this movie was boring, you open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse must not be ignored. I work in a correction facility as a chemical addiction advisor and I deal with these issues every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are affected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and causes serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. It is all possible to prevent. This movie should appear in every high school in the world. If anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it, or sell me a copy, send me an email at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thanks
