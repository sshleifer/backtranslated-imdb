I thought this movie was really great! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I'd like to see this movie over and over again if I could. I also loved the end. This movie has clearly shown a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love them both so I also highlighted this movie. In the end, when Drew makes the big comment about the truth, it really told the truth about what sometimes happens in High School. Again, the movie was amazing. Defiantly and 10/10. Hope this comment was very useful for all IMDb readers.
