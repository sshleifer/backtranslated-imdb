The biggest tragedy man faces is that, as often as the divine, he can settle for banal. From this fact, so much tragedy arises. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and courage to cope with this fact. It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms - self-denial and decay. It is undoubtedly the greatest movie that has no visible influence on the mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echo sound, mix of non-written languages ​​and very challenging themes are impossible to copy: just as much an accident with its own production as the vision of its director. The central achievement that is immediately stiff, awakened and vulnerable in the light of expression and decadence highlights Bogarde as if not the best British actor of his generation, so certainly the most adventurous. Could hold onto sympathy as his wishes bring him over and interesting in spite of the endless close-ups and the Mahler score that plays over him. Not one on a Friday night with your boyfriend, but definitely OK if you want to explore the boundaries of human spiritual limitation.
