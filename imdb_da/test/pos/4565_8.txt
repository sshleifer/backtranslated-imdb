The 1970s saw an increase and fall in what we have been told as "Blacksploitation" Films. The term is a reference to a kind of broad catch-all, rather than a real movie genre. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban police and robbers shoot-em-up that are so constructed and then cast as to appeal to the great Urban Black population in the mid-20th century. It could actually embrace the widest type of film, as long as it had a slope toward the inner-city population. It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films of particular interest to black Americans originated with the Eastertime Release of 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod. 20th Century Fox, 1969). In it had former Syracuse University All-American Footballer and several Times All-Pro Fullback to Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown, a co-Starring Billing. After appearing in a number of films, such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others, it began to give more meaning to Studios' Suits "that Jim was a hot property. <br /> <br /> Now, this 100 RIFLES record numbers of black patrons bring to the major cities' key business districts on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown, why not start filming more of these adventure epics and other types movie with several Black Players and Stars? Why not, actually. ** So we saw a number of Cops & Robbers, Bad-ass Private Detective Films, Comedies, all going on the route. Along the way, we finally got some more family-oriented and wider appealing films Filmmakers were addressed to SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and ultimately CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In CLAUDINE, we find no stigmatization or easy classification as "Blackploitation" as the story is universal and could easily have been done as a story about people of a new lineage, anywhere, and not just in the 1970s USA. <br /> <br /> The story was made by a single mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), struggling to keep a family together after ".... two marriages and two almost marriages." is far from a shoot -up-up Harlem Style. The problems that plague the daily citizens of our nation are confronted and investigated under the sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudin's psychological and physical needs as female. For "Woman needs man and man must have its size", *** and we admit this point. (It's SEX we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets with a very masculine, broad-shouldered athletic type in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones), and they go on a date. The great welfare state intervenes with the couple when Claudine's Welfare Case Worker, Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti) comes snooping around to see who is this unattached male who suddenly pays so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humiliating experience with the Welfare Bureau's revision and deducting binge, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to marry or without the blessing of Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's older son has been involved in some great speeches, but little does the Black Activist group. But with Ruppert's help he and they all come through it A.O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends with a happy, optimistic and hopeful note. We know it may not be exactly "... fortunately ever after!" But rather it will do everything! If there is a single criticism that we have to say, sometimes in a movie like this one is misunderstood to a large extent by Urban Blacks. And it is the seemingly implied myth that all whites are wealthy, without having any of their kind who ever need a helping hand, out of work or suffering any disability. Well, people, it's just ain It's not true! NOTE: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as a robust player. He was even tame as "... The Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing All-Black Casts movies recorded for All-Black consumption was not a new idea. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, we saw productions by people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** It is "As time goes by", Schultz, it is from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
