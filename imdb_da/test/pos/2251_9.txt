Excellence seems to come rarely in Hollwood today. Many consider only two of this year's best picture candidates to show meaning to the film industry. And in 'Everything is illuminated', the mark is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The film launches its brilliance with the beautiful setting on stage. From the beginning you get a sense of warmth and true family relationships and relationships between one and the other. And the cast is also perfectly introduced. For Elijah Woods character, Jonathon, his sensation is expressed by holding his dying grandmother's hand. And for the character "Alex" it is easy to see his life in his perspective - the true Ukrainian rock star. With the light in the first place, the story slowly eases into our minds when Jonathon decides to venture to Ukraine to meet the woman who thought to save her grandfather, the whole family. And from there, the story movie slowly but still held at a fast pace from the contrast of tear-drip drama and grin-out loud humor included in the scene-by-scene, every scene. <br /> <br /> Though the movie itself is rather award-winning, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of Jonathon Safron Foer's novel. Personally, I have never read the novel. But any movie, especially this movie, should not be judged about the movie's storyboard matching the story of the book, but rather how the major concepts of the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. Just because it can be removed from the novel does not mean that this movie is no longer a must-see-it is still. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, new information is flooding the mind of the audience very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the other half of the film transforms its entire subject and the reason to travel through Ukraine to something else, yet rather resembles the original intentions of this movie. The film, however, gives you a happy note - but to the weak hearts a tear can be lost. And throughout the movie. To those saneful people with a sense of humor just laugh from Alex and John's fun and ongoing conversations. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to several different types of people: For those who enjoy movies sharing genre drama comedy, for those who are interested in family relationships, and for those who are interested in holocaust topics. And to the crazy people who find slapstick as a fun comedy, this movie is not for you. And for those of you who think this is a seriously fun and brilliant fun movie, you're wrong; This movie shares comic moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who judge a movie based on their likelihood of the corresponding novel, you may not like this movie, but this movie has to be taken much more than if it were close to the book. <br /> <All in all, all the light is a brilliant job that will enlighten everyone's hearts.
