I watched this movie many years ago, and it has never left my list of best movies ever made. When I first looked at it, I just started what has become a lifelong passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> Once you have a cast like this, you have the right to assume that it will be nothing short of fabulous. This is by far the best role I've ever seen Sean Penn play (along with I'm Sam). He nails the role, does not glamorize his actions while he does. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie, which I thought was very important. Up to the end he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past but still makes excuses for it. He ends up being able to redeem his sense of self-esteem as much as a convicted (and guilty) killer can use Susan Sarandon's character, sister Helen Prejean. Her character taught me about goodwill toward others without letting me forget how terrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The support support was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a little como by Jack Black in this movie with the funny man he has become today! I loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinema. And in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the film went far beyond the book.
