I was amazed at the quality of this movie, especially after seeing the almost adult director - all 140 (?) Lbs of him! Really a boy leading a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl movies. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a little too long. There was too much time showing that Connor was unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, who was so young, could easily have been closer to Caleb and later decided that it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" on corruption and politics. Instead, he did not give a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. And what about bad Caleb? Owen could have had a good influence. Though the film intends to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption, I felt sad for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have a boy-boy fun with Caleb, who was exceptionally beautiful. Owen did not have to go along with the political perversion offered. But he could have tried to have fun with Caleb and still went away when he wanted to. Obviously, Owen was responsible - no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do. But he could have had more fun and a very warm girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke is making more movies, where appealing young characters have more fun.
