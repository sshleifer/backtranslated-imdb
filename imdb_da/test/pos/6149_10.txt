I disagree with the imdb.com synopsis that it is about a bisexual guy who is preparing to get married. It is more about everything we go through - self-induced and because of our parents - that we must "come over" when we grow up. As Linda McCarriston's poem says, "Childhood is barrel they throw you over the fall in." This movie is much more like a narrative poem. It's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt, we inflict and experience over the years, and how ultimately it is about love (I'm not trying to be hypersensitive or schmoopy) and find and be with a special person.
