Even with the entire cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to a Degree), we feel that we do not even know half of what happened. Even the fear is considering feeling inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity it necessitates is an important part of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's largest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, "The Heart of the Dark", which chronicles the loss of mentality and corruption of morality that comes away from civilization - a surface of a bestial character as it was a wing of a wing - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is by Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first trip to Vietnam is served. Willard at the beginning of the movie stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to return home - echoing Nicky in the deer hunter. So he is approached: His mission is to murder a renegade Green Beret, who has isolated himself in a remote post at the Nung River and allegedly gone insane - worshiped as a god by the natives and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in his second best role in his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard travels up in an army boat where some soldiers accompany him, his witness sees horror and insanity - and the overwhelming pointless of it all - to a sinister sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. At the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't seem to be right or wrong, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, the outpost at the end of the world. Lack of civilization, loss of judgment, self-confidence. Kurtz's monologue for a cruelty, which he witnessed as a green mountain, and his later revelation, is one of the most chilling and well-known speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its point of departure - here is much like The Deer Hunter, and just as well. The Apocalypse, however, sets the limits for what we can endure at a global level - Coppola's sweeping footage of Cambodia's humid, creepy jungle and an opening series of helicopters between exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly appropriate door's soundtrack - and chilling scenes on the river and an air raid on a village with Wagner spraying from loudspeakers (a scene that has fallen down as one of the most chilling, darkly humorous and striking meaningless war images ever) - all contributing to the feeling of apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at any distant point in the future, but the apocalypse now and forever. The deer hunter is much more dense and personal, you can even tell with the title and show the total effect trauma on the individual psyche, the degradation of the human soul and its ability to either give up to the forces of darkness, or to stop at. Therefore, both films are the same - they are two parts of the same thing. In "The Heart of Darkness" Kurtz is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and his inner wildness. In Apocalypse Now Kurtz has left all conflict. He is beyond good and evil. He has deleted the morale as a drowned man lets a saving hand go ahead of his death. In fact, Kurtz only waits for death and quotes T. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words and the words echo at the end of the movie are: "Horror ... horror." He refers to the infinite life weight, the human psyche, and the silent emptiness in his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express the experiences you go through with looking at this movie - that experience, in short, that Willard experiences on his journey. The end part, at the outpost, which is almost comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the deep, quiet and seductive disturbing things I've ever seen.
