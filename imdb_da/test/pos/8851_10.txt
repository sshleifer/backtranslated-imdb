People with a tendency to do may find some scenes going on, but The Thing is far from being simply a horror classic. The fact that the exceptional special effects are against most modern CGIs is only a small part of why this film is finally legally regarded as a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his camera work and editing, excellent scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tensions and paranoia maintained throughout (with countless prospects), an excellent soundtrack and open to more readings and analogy, there are simply not enough superlatives to do this movie justice. Absolutely crucial view.
