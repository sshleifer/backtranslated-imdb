It is very true that this film challenges the convention by not spelling the plot to the viewer. While some may have a problem finding out for themselves, I embrace "Uzumaki" for its unrecognition. There is a PLOT, it is just that it may not be readily available to a lazy seer. This is a movie featuring numerous interpretations that all great art does - but this movie is also very entertaining, making it a rare movie experience. It is also provocative and fun.
