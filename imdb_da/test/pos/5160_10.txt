I really couldn't see this coming. Roy Andersson made me stick out, I'm the perfect sugar for a static camera (long live King Borowczyk!) And I laughed hysterically in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, he hit me right between my eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make selfish fun. Andersson reminds me of a third party at Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who took his whole life to be a practical joke that the good gentleman himself plays on us. And the network of selfishness in this movie is really fun. The level of satire is at pyre height, you have a fake self-pity dreaming harp on the cruelty of the world and then completely ignore a spiritual self-reflection that cries out in pain. The depth of the ego itself is plumbed. I never thought it was possible to go beyond Bergman's "The Silence" in this regard. However, the grotesque of self-love and self-respect, by every character in this film, is staggering. We are shown an existence where the talented and idle shine against a world they believe has been unfair to them, they are really legends in their own living rooms. The people in this movie make self-deception and self-deception a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only a woman in the movie seems to have some kind of understanding of what's going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, knelt down and prayed for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. She reveals, through her prayers, that what is wrong with the world should not be solved by mere thought, there are not only a few errors that are abysmal of corruption that can only be counteracted by tearing and doomsday. By watching this movie, I put myself in a naked monk standing waist deep in a cold river at midnight, screaming out a thousand Kyrie eleisons for the sins of mankind. Another great thing is that it is clear that her prayers are in vain and that she actually stops everyone coming home at closing time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for the alley, no one is saved, no idols are left on the altar, no group of people are indignant to another group's glory. Never has there been a larger, more transcendent, more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. It's a movie to the end of the world, it's the big scream, the great hideous practical joke in human life! <br /> <br /> From the catalog of pictures it is too difficult to choose a favorite, I hit my thigh and almost fell off my chair at the cinema and screamed with laughter as a man tried to pull the tablecloth under a set service. I don't want to spoil what happens, but the excitement builds up, and something really happens unexpectedly. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. I'm pretty well booked and I just couldn't control myself: it's the goal of the greatness of this movie. The shooting of "You, the Living" is impeccably formalistic. We are shown the palette of an artist, dingy brown, yellow, gray and cloud blues alive by the shock of luminous brass structures. There is never a tone out of place, it's like an hour and a half of the symphonic Whistlerian color message. The obsession that has gone into putting that color scheme in place is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted, as with all the big movies, there's no extra empty celluloid. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.
