Glenn Ford is employed by a busy bank owner and wily stable owner Edger Buchanan to put a fake robbery while the banker hides the real pledge. With Ford a no-show, the two instead go with a trigger gratifying second choice, leaving Ford on the hook for killing, which he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures' first color feature, Desperadoes looks great with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process and highlight tons of affluent Western plays. <br /> <br /> This has the irresistible composition of a young Glenn Ford (third image but mostly star) and a primary Randolph Scott, who runs an incredibly offensive piece of great character actors in colorful roles including scene-stealing Edger Buchanan as a good-natured but mild-crooked yokel who is not as stupid as he looks and who has some memorable lines. br /> <br /> A rather complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy, ordered by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great western of nineteen and forty and highly recommended.
