This is one of the best and most evocative Vampire Tales ever! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the rankings and the story. In fact, the picture is not a big budget production, but it is definitely worth seeing. OK, there are some errors (especially the names of the castle and the sites) in this movie, but such errors are typical and are almost in every horror movie. Nature fits perfectly with the story and is close to reality, I can honestly say because I visit them once when I was in Romania during my holidays. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the sub-series.
