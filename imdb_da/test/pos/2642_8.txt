There are many people who put down on these type 80s movies, but these people may not have come to age at this time. I just started college when this movie was released so I could really appreciate it at the time, and my friends and I still to this day will sometimes joke about certain lines in the movie. As much as I liked Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli in the "Fast Times", I actually enjoy Chris Penns Character "Tommy" more because he is the protagonist with more of an actual speaking role as opposed to just a series of lines as with Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably pop this movie into his VCR and use it for motivation to lose something. Yes, the partial plot with Randy Quaid, the Vietnam veterinarian, seems a little out of place, but he does a convincing job in the role. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen this movie, but likes the other similar type of movie like "Fast Times" etc. I highly recommend it.
