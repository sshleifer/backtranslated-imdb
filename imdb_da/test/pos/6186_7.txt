Years before the prenuptial agreements became a regular thing, Ernest Lubitsch made a screen comedy that they are the foundation for. Bluebeard's eighth woman involves Gary Cooper as a millionaire living on the French Riviera who has been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for eight. But Cooper is a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $ 50,000 a year as a deal they sign before marrying him. It sounds like what we now call an early retirement agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants much more than that, and she feels that Cooper is taking too much business as an approach to marriage. She wants the right deal and is willing to go far to get it. Bluebeard's eighth wife has some really fun moments, the original meeting for Cooper and Colbert in a men's shop where Cooper insists he only wants the pajamas tops and Colbert is looking for only bottom. And of course, my favorite Colbert is in demand and deterrent detective Cooper sends to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best entertainment role in the film as the same, burst detective. <br /> <br /> I have often wondered how back in the day Hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are not French in a movie like this. Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert of cast is the only one who is actually of French background. Although David Niven is charming as always, he is ridiculous because he is a Frenchman. He is soooooo British. Nevertheless, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is a fun movie and a good example of what was called "Lubitsch touch" back then.
