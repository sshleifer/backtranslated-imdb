More entertaining than all homosexuals in "300" combined. More heartbreaking than a Shakespeare tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And to top it all, it made the biggest garbage ever. <br /> <br /> A black comedy testing the boundaries of human senses, John Waters cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story of the conflict between two families ending in humiliation, death and of course eating the dog's stools (yes, by the way In fact, it's not the humiliating part. No, it's not about the impossible love, there's no Romeos or Juliet's in those 90 minutes. This movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. The fight for the title - Filthiest person alive. On the one hand, we have divine (played by cross-dressing Waters regular ... umm ... Divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, killer, pervert, and current owner of that title. She loves her son Crackers a bit too much. Crackers themselves cultivate a sexual attraction for both chickens and young ladies who sometimes mix them into triplets. Family friend and loyal accomplice Cotton is pleased to see Crackers during some of his ... actions involving the former objects of attraction mentioned. Last but not least, Divine Mother and Grandmother for Crackers, Edie. A 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and living basically in a baby cradle. She relies on eggs and loves the eggman (the man who brings the eggs ... lol). The four live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the time they become a target for the marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very evil people indeed. Their main source of income comes from kidnapping and impregnation of young women. For the impregnation part, they use their reliable and loyal cross-dressing butler to give the semen. Then they sell the born child to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the envy of the marble toward divine and her title that would lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle for filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unmatched masterpiece in the garbage genre. Loaded with inequalities and strange actions, John Waters film is disgusted and hated by traditionists, critics, and the average movie gang. But for the few who remain untouched by these generalizations, Flamingos is an unforgettable experience. Fun and sick, violent and poetic. It really is an exercise in bad taste
