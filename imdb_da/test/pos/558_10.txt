One must see the documentary .----- This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary for an experiment on a 15-year-old black child named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the dead woman's husband about the description of the man who killed his wife. The man seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. Police a little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is careful to get information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigations and battles against his young client to confess him. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was asked. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the sound is monitored. He asks a policeman on the stand and asks what he heard Brenton say to one of the investigators, and he challenges their own words. McGuinness examines with Ann Finnell where the police should have gone and the things they should have done, but not. The movie shows Butlers as a loving Christian family who trust their son's innocence and believe that God will set Brenton free. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge, and everyone involved in this case. I'm white and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police posts treat other blacks. It was very disappointing to see black and white police hold together when they think they got their husband. The police have a hard work, and I think most of them are reputable, not like those in this movie. I think it's a good movie for everyone involved in the judiciary, including judges, policemen and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.
