My girlfriend and I watched this movie when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwanted pregnancy) were issues that never touched our view of the movie. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and experienced many of the same intense and confusing feelings. We were too young to be caught up in the simplistic (sometimes) plays and the corny (sometimes) emotional phrases. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story could never have. I still remember sitting at the cinema with my boyfriend and holding my hand while she was crying under the tragic (albiet syrup) final scenes.
