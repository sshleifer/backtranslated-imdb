This show has a fantastic plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from Boston Legal and Boris the Butcher from Snatch). Even the extras and the child I believed from commercially could be a weak link, surprised me by his skill. It's just the little things that the director has to adjust. Just like the guy doing the last episode at the beginning of each new episode, has to be fired. Having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruin the story. The only other small problem I had was that sometimes they take too long to do things, but not as long as some show as a prison break. Anyone know when to resume the season ??
