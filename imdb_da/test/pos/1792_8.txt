The merchant of four seasons is not what I would call a happy movie at all or even one that impressed me to praise it to heaven (there are other Fassbinder flicks for it, like Veronika Voss and the underrated Satan's Brew). But it is certainly not a fascinating experiment to look at them in a society that you and I and others we know may or may not know. I imagine in the early 70s in Germany that a generation who came out of World War II had a stigma to live with, but tried their best to just pass by. This is a stigma flowing all over this movie, and in many cases in Fassbinder's work in general, but especially because, with four seasons, he watches the middle class, and a particular couple - the distant, depressed, angry Hans the fruit seller and his long-suffering wife - it is nothing less than trying for realism in the dam of the melodrama. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, maybe he could make this movie, maybe even as a lark. <br /> <br /> The story sounds simple enough where his drink gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the hardest to take, perhaps in any movie that Fassbinder's camera linger without a cut when his wife left helpless and their daughter is trying to stop him in his frenzy and then she is ready to leave him. As he stands in the room, the family holds him back, she calls for divorce, and he gets a heart attack right there. He re-establishes his business suddenly begins to flourish again with the help of some good (or not so good) employees - and yet this only continues his yearning for another woman and his despair in general. <br /> <br /> And yet it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder is trying and succeeding mostly in achieving a mood of fear, a tense mood in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and soften. The weakest part of this whole can be the actor ... at least it was my first impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be a stylish presence with only the slightest movements in the face and eyes, and for a while it does not seem like he is much of a good actor. The actor, who plays his wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) are doing better, but only because they are getting more to do conventionally, like crying or looking worried. It takes a little time to adapt to what is essentially a void in his guy Hans, of something from his own psychological self-torment or self-pity that permeates himself and those around him who just want to continue with some sense of normality, especially when Hans becomes successful. Not everything clicks together in The Merchant of Four Seasons, but probably made me recommend it to those looking for a different life than you could be used to with more modern American movies. Fassbinder's world is here a battle between the melodrama he loves in the cinema and the hard, crushing sense of humanism that he feels personal and puts into characters that we can better or worse identify with. Is Epps a family you know about? Or can you even be them? Who should say. It is a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and its goals have been achieved.
