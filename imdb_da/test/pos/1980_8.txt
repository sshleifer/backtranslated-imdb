This movie is breathing and thinking. But I think maybe it can only be appreciated by die-hard RPG fun. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too playful and just has too many twists. The turns are exaggerated. Jude Law gives a very good performance. I really like him in this movie, like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in the A.I.
