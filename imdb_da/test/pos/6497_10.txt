Excellent performance. There are still good actors around! Also fantastic management and photography. Very true to Shakespear, and a must for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monologue (out short light) He gave the sphere of moral decay and darkness strengthens a human face, making it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerful at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and Shakespear's texts ... this is it.
