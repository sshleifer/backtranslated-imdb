As a child growing up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify with the contents of this fine film. Every week, I visited the Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street to see Cinesound (and usually 3 Stooges) shorts. Never have there been a better blend of B / W and color in a movie. Flawless production values ​​round off a never-forgotten movie experience.
