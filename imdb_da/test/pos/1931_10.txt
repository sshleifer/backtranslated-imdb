Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions of an ordinary man in a compelling documentary film. Testimony and archive film is a fascinating insight into the late 1960s and a groundbreaking world competition. The personal conflicts with the duty of family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting movies I've seen. I was not aware of the history of this story and the drama was successful and clearly directed. The story is mostly respect for the participants with heroes and villains implicitly rather than ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is open to the viewer, giving room to personally relate to situations and signs. This movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful excitement, joy and drama.
