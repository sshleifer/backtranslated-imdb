<br /> <br /> As a Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the other reviewer's comments, except that I feel that "Movie Crazy" was his best sound movie; "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But this is just my opinion). <br /> <br /> This movie is a "hoot" from the beginning to the end, and in many scenes George Barbier (the villain who makes him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> You want Una Merkel's character to be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially when the movie progresses. Only in the last few minutes of the movie do we find out her true feelings for him. (And even then there is no "romance" - kissing, etc.). <br /> <br /> This is a Must-See movie!
