Um .... a serious movie about troubled teens in Singapore, a country I don't know much about, but have the wrong wrong impression that all the kids are very disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, like the other cities / countries, they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprisingly rebellious way of life for drugs, fighting, bad language and .... many other obvious signs of being a bad boy The surprising part of this movie is not entirely about how these children run around, causing themselves and other problems, but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so-called loyalty between them. The connection between these "brothers" may well come from an unconscious homosexual tendency in these boys. Although it is not uncommon for the str8 guys to have a very close friendship with each other, but look closely at this movie, it should come into all sorts of gay film festivals, and I wouldn't be surprised that it could win much more prizes to this direction!
