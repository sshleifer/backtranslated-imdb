I hate movies about sports. I think the prefabricated Hollywood sports film is a little hard for me to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use exhibition "A" ?? The "game plan" as proof of this if you want it. So, of course, I was hesitant to see this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like "Step into Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, I fell into the unknown, and to be honest, I was not happy at first. I did not like the direction, the people or the style that the film included to present these young sports entrepreneurs. With my first impression, I thought the story could not be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux actors who appeared like they were from the late 70's. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed band from this generation to our enjoyment, but visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using great music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these children were, where they went under their resurrection, and where they are now. It felt like I was looking at our nation's birth with a great score for the settlers who just calmed their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths. <br /> <br /> So with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I saw movies again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this movie done "wow-ed" me. This was suddenly turned into the movie I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more about where these children are today what they are still doing and how hard it was to get some of them on the camera. He hadn't seen many of them for 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, but he showed so much commitment to this project. Although I do not agree with everything he chose to do (ie Sean Penn rod is not PUNK ROCK), he revived this movie for me. It was because of this comment that I rate this movie much higher than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names to be mentioned, and are continually presented if skateboarding is to continue the fast-growing trend it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, these guys, these mildly-coated pavers, redefined a whole sport. Sure, others did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style, grace and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also pushed them in one direction, I think none of them were ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the history of evolution, to be in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without television to keep us planted and about friendship. We have seen so many stories in the years that show the evolution of humanity, and it is certainly a story to be added. I can't say I loved this movie, nor will I, but it should be standard view for anyone who learns or wants to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad it was emotional, and these guys aren't more millionaires again? they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see it in documentaries. Overall, I can't watch this movie again, but I would suggest it to friends and family time after time. I think the downfall of this movie, for me, was the movie? the attempt to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately distanced itself from signs and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some elements that needed too much, leaving us with little or no time to know where these guys were now. Of course, Peralta had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he was sometimes out of focus. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, while being decent with his voice-over, was not necessary at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive side, the audio commentary captures everything the ordinary film lacked. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn, brings a stronger human element to the scene as he tells us better stories about the people, places, and events. Watch this movie, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Degree: *** Â½ out of *****
