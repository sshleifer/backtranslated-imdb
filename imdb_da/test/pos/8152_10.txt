For an independent film, it scores well with reasonably high production values ​​and a large cast. The play is uneven, but the plot is convincing. We could have used a bit more development of Wes Ramsey's character, but hey, the guy is fun to watch anyway! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like icing on the cake. It is not surprising that it was controversial in publishing. It presents a less than flattering depiction of the Morman Church and its relationship with homosexuals. While Brokeback Mountain is about tolerance and acceptance of one's own life, I found it more successful in conveying a positive message. It was also more moving.
