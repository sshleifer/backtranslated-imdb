I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass certainly brought thunder in this epic tale of friendship, hard rocking and destiny. <br /> <br /> Filled to the brim with unnecessary swarms in every sentence, toilet humor and the general rule breaking stance, this movie is a must see for the hard-core D-fans in the world. We follow the journey to young jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try to restore the choice of fate, to win the open Mic night, and to become the greatest band on the planet. The duo must overcome obstacles like a room full of lasers, a man with a leg and the devil to perform their task. I let you see if they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is amazing enough, and now we see D personally, which makes the experience even more magical. One must look for everyone who calls themselves a solid D-fan. Watch the inside jokes from the first album!
