I usually fall in and out of love with anime, as the more you see the more you notice many shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashed by old formulas. But every once in a while, one of the true gems comes together and it's originality that just blows you away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly finished and does not exploit the benefits the animation has over static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animation, good voice acting, good music and a complete and successful story. See it, you won't be disappointed and I suggest to see it in broadcast orders, it seems so much better that way.
