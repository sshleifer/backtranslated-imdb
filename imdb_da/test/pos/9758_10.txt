I can't believe it's been 25 years since I first saw this story on television. I remembered having been very touched by it and was fortunate to get VHS tape several years ago. I didn't look at it again until recently. I've been seeing it again and again ever since. I must have seen it 10 times in the last 2 weeks. The action is amazing, the story is convincing, and I am embarrassed to say that I do not appreciate actor Bryan Brown's talent so far. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya, is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body language in the second half: in their first drink together in Caines and the tour. We have to wait for the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his open show of love for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed their admiration in Malaya. Who wouldn't be his wife Boong? <br /> <br /> As Joe switched from a cocky, almost larger than life figure in the Malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average Joe in his own backyard, Jean took the opposite road; Her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. She didn't waste time and went for what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - just as Joe had told her once. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help show that this is more than just a love story - it's a story of growth, courage, and fragility in life. The lawyer -Noel is both a sweet and sad figure. He also gave much to Jean - he gave his last hope of love. At the end he did what true love requires - he put his happiness in front of him. <br /> <br /> I happened to be the fight between Joe & Jean who wasn't in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition, for it helped surface the inner struggles that they both had to deal with to make their lives together possible. <br /> <br /> Now I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> However, I am surprised to see B. Brown having blue eyes in the promo image shown on this site. He was definitely not in "A city like Alice." Well, 25 years is a long time!
