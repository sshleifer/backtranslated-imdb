Can't say this wasn't good. At a recent film festival, the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. And there is not the slightest indication that he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strange non-Spanish film the same way, West Side Story was many years ago. Both leaders, a nephew, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a kind of underground car repair in Queens, is quite foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission alone. But there is something unsatisfactory about the key problem in the film, namely what her sister feels she needs to do to get past. I can understand brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easy to get to me. The movie seems to suggest that people like these do not need our help, they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I do not encourage anyone to believe in it. There would be much more opposition to the choices made here than depicted. Apart from that, entertainment works well. As a precise portrayal of a culture, not so good, I think.
