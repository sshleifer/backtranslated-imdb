I'm Egyptian. I have a green card. I have lived in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (non-American, but non-Egyptian, non-Arab wife). I have children born in the United States. I have a PhD in cell biology from the United States and I travel to conferences. I make 6 figurine income and I own a home in the Washington, DC area. I pay my tax and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets I have no spot on my record since I came to this country in 1991. I see more Egyptian than the Ibrahimi character but my spoken English is as good as his. <br /> A few months ago, I came back from a conference / business in Spain through Munich Germany to Washington, DC (Home). I was picked up in Munich airport by a German officer as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. He was about to interrogate me until I simply told him "I have no business in Germany, I just go through". He had let me go with the biggest disappointment. It was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, Dulles airport (which wasn't as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). Customs asked me a few questions about the length and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my user declaration form and let me go. After I picked up my checked bag, I was stopped at the last exit (Some Homeland Security crap). I sat there for 3 hours with many different people of many different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detention. I am not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. I was feisty by first asking to be told by the cause or letting me go, but decided to suck it and just wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I would be late, but I was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello" an officer phoned the phone out of hand and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked to call home because my family was waiting, they said, "Three hours is nothing we will contact after 5 hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer followed me there. The toilet was fun; I think it was a prison style toilet that is all metal without toilet seat. Finally they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you could go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie, it was very well made. Unlike most movies involving Arabs and using non-Arab actors who just speak gibberish, this movie was the 100% correct Arabic. I suppose the country is Morocco (North Africa).
