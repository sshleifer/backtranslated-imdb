I saw this version about ten years ago and have seen it ever since. I recently found an original VHS version and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it one of the best Broadway musical scenes ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why is it just a little over paying for a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they will soon release this in the DVD form. It is a musical theater that screams to be seen by everyone!
