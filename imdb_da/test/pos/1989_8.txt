eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, where characters run from rich to rich, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they do not know about the goal of or exactly where it leads them. Within the virtual reality game, several layers are virtual reality games that question what reality they come from is the "real" one. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not spectacular to conceal that it is not going to reasonably answer a true reality, rather than speculating on the idea of ​​whether it is genuine or a video game being questioned even to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that the twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a way it's a little disturbing. The problem with this film, however, is its basic nature, in a way. Cronenberg questions reality and criticizes the game. But the same things he uses to criticize games, make him experience it: the violence, discontinuity, lack of focus and in a way, the pixelation, even though there is no such pixelation in the movie. I once heard someone say that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of hyperviolence in the media, but he hides it well with the fact that he is so incredibly pleased to rip new openings to humans, animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge. /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and written about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not to say exactly what you mean during cut scenes, relative lack of environment or non-sense environment only a few people around where it feels there must be many and vice versa, all the things) along with the motive for penetration. It certainly deconstructs the video game reality in a way that is nauseating and absurd, but it does even better by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological material that curl and change and are honestly disgusting to the most horrible degrees. For what it's worth, this movie gives you a reaction. <br /> <br /> But what for? It criticizes the virtual reality, but it is a movie: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character designs, but it maintains the banality. It seems definitely worrying about killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual person and how video games can be confused with reality and not making people think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet I say again It is the greatest pleasure to tear people, objects, animals, things and organisms into bloody tears. <br /> <br /> So while it has a central focus on anxiety, it doesn't matter, not really. Only what it does is to present that fear in such an original way that it cannot really be denied its own moment of splendor. In a way, it would be much easier to just hate this movie to be gory and violent, because there is no good reason to look to love it, and yet I cannot ignore it as mediocre or bad. It would be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there is nothing I can really do about it. I think it's a little exaggerated, it didn't really have to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed and confused that I don't know if it was Cronenberg's fault or Cronenberg's point, and I don't think There really is no way to find out, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
