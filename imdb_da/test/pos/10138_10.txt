The fact that the film is based on a true story, contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the film's basic theme. The story is filled with unexpected twists that keep the viewer at all times unable to count the end. In a moment you think something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. It does, but certainly not what you would expect. The movie is in no way boring or too sentimental, and Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr.'s appearances are some of their best in my opinion. The end puts a long-lasting smile on your face and makes you doubt about what you're doing is right. Well, that was what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich tried to do. Premium movie. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
