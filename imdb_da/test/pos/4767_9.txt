It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before that, there was too much Hays Code-constricted cardboard. With Star Wars, the green light turned on for most movies aimed at children and morons, a practice that continues to this day. The seven weeks the truth is told contain a few hackneyed lines of dialogue - "we can do it the easy way or we can do it the hard way" is one - but I'm damn if I can find something else wrong with it. (In fact, that line might not even have become obsolete when this movie was made.) The SEVEN UPS demonstrates the right thing with the best movies in the Golden Age: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real-life (winter in a dirty New York has never seen better / worse, propelling stories, and yes, the best car hunt ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider chasing (you will recognize him from Bullitt), and the chase's structure is very similar to the McQueen one, but I prefer Scheider's face intensity here, pacing, the schools' amazing close-ups, and the splitting conclusion. (That VW bug goes about 2 km / h always disturbs me in the Bullitt hunt.) A twisted, screechy score from Don Ellis puts the perfect mood. The seven ups: gloomy, gloomy, action-oriented, adults. This is a movie that couldn't be made today; there is no "gimmick" for the kiddies or obstructive ending. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: As long as copfilm is seen, the SEVEN UPS and its 70-year-old brothers (eg, the FRENCH CONNECTION) will set the standard.
