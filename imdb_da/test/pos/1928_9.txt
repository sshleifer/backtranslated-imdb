I happened to happen by this. I was with my friends and he was just starting to see it, so I sat down and thought we'd shoot the breeze while this was playing in the background. But within seconds I was immersed in this docu-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other. <br /> <br /> I never knew the story of the first solo around the world's yacht race, let alone the tragic events of a man's attempt at the odds that made his redemption for all his accidents in life, but ultimately end with to become an example of them. When I did not know the story, I saw it with the same joy that I imagine those who read about the race, at the time it actually happened, spoiled in what took place and eager for more information, hoping the only one amateur was going to pull it out against the odds and beat the pros, making the shocking twists of the story the more tragic, I felt I was living the story. The story is told with great care and the interviewers have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives great insight, but is also opposite of the recordings of interviews at the time of the tragedy. The recordings and photographs of the only sailors are also excellently used, and the insight into the sailor's mind and how loneliness affects them was amazing. I am shocked that this story is no longer known or has been transformed into a movie, but also grateful. Grateful that we have this drama documentary to tell the tale of those who knew the man, rather than an adventurous movie adaptation, and grateful that I captured this gem of a pure-chance movie. <br /> <br /> It is a must see whether you like documentaries or not.
