I'm not paying particular attention to Michael Jackson. Apart from being a pedophile, I really don't like his music, except for a few songs from his landmark, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> This was directed by John Landis, best known for horror fans as director of AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is not so much a music video, but more or less a short horror movie. MJ and his date is with a werewolf movie. When they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies as Michael Jackson makes his famous "Thriller" dance. You know, it's really a really good song with good synthetic beats. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can tolerate over and over again. I especially love Vincent Price's cameo as the narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. Even if you don't like M.J.'s music, you should watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a scary white woman with a false nose.
