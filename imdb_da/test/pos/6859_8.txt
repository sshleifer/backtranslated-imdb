I would use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but it was already taken lol. It sums up anatomy nicely. Provided you are no stranger to reading subtitles, Anatomy fits closely with the Scream / Urban Legend package. It is a teen horror in a medical school where students go away and then turn up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab. Cue a beautiful student examines herself and reveals a huge conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Assuming you see the original German language film (I can't comment on the duplicate, haven't seen the English version) Anatomy is sharply written and wisely plotted, so the excitement never really lets up. Compared to the American counterparts, the mystery is uncovered much faster, which means that instead of being a slasher right up to the final disclosure, Anatomy develops over time from a slasher-come-body horror movie to a smart and exciting thriller. It is an exciting journey from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the actors involved too. Franka Potente once again shows that she is an intelligent, smart actress who can make any role a living. Her central performance as Paula is a good foundation for the film to build from. The spooky lecturers and their teacher's pets are just as good, a real prehistoric presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that the movie doesn't draw much. The pace is fast and tight, much like the previous Urban Legend, which means that something always keeps the attention high. If there is a drawback, it may be that some will find anatomy too cruel to them, but if you continue through the first half with admittedly graphical dissection sequences, the last half with the thrilling thriller overtones will reward you. I recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teenage fear, but is a little pampered with the American take on the case.
