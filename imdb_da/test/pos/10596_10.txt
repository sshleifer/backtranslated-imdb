This movie had everything I needed in a movie: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! The art and camera effects in this movie are amazing. The music in this movie is the best I have heard in any other movie. Each track goes so well with its scene. I thought the play was really good considering that none of Bams crew's been in script movies before. Although the whole movie concept is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) sleeping with Hellboy behind his back, a predictable and old story is. The way it performs is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Raab Himself, Dunn breaks bottles behind wawa and all Don Vito scenes. These movies are a must see!
