This is the greatest movie if you want inspiration to follow your heart and never give up on your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet, and Mickey Rooney, in her sensation (at least in her childhood), is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and goes out to the Grand National Tower with her beloved horse "Pi" - short for "Pirate" - only to get Velvet to jockey and have a chance of victory. To those of you who have not seen it yet, I will not give away the end, but you must see it, and when you do, you will love it. Note a very young Angela Lansbury as the oldest sister of the velvet.
