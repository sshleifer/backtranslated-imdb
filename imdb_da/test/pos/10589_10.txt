This movie kicks ass, bar none. Bam and his crue have made themselves with this movie. When I got the DVD (4 days ago) I have seen it three times and it gets better every time I see it. I can't wait for Grind to come out in theaters. If it is something like Haggard, it will be worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTcellphone
