At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The next day I had a unique movie after a taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human task to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The management is clueless and cold. He is like us all, he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and to be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV with no direction or motive just to pass time and entertain himself. In the end, it's too late. Since my first visit to the United States, it has grown on me as a custom fit dream, where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film is conveyed to my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. It may sound strange, but somehow this movie was able to touch me in a deep way like no other. I recommend it.
