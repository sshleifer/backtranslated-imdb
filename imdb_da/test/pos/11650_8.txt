This was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! It refused to seem unilateral, and the emotions felt the whole story is just as real as it can get. This movie had one of the most 'human' (And I use this expression in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! This movie actually made me go out to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen exercised more of a spiritual tone than a religious one (which is also rare). And it presented both sides to the problem, so people on both sides who saw the movie would not feel that a point had been omitted. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a movie for entertainment. But it is movies that deliver a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can't think of another movie like that.
