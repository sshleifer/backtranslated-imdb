This DVD will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees around the world because Rush is just not cool. It's a shame that Rush has had to overcome the creepy contempt of most North American and British music journalists during their thirty odd years of history, as this has deprived many people of the chance to enter a true band. Each of the last four decades is well represented here and what a catalog of songs it is! We have the seminal "2112", the magic "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer" interspersed with the high performance genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "Vapor Trails." The music is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular, and the Brazilian fans are simply insane (at one time they sang together for an instrumental!) Each band member plays at a level that can withstand faithful artisans performing arts. If you doubt this, try out the instruments "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size - and yes the latter is a drum solo (which one has to believe in.) <br /> <br /> Sound and vision production values ​​are very high that fits the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angle set of pieces to start. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing achievement and tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
