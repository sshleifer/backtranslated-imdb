A movie like this does not follow too often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civilian hawks should see this before making decisions about how the devastating people live, I saw this the day after watching the television series "Uprising" about the Warsaw Ghetto. Even with this fresh mind, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take a while to thaw out of this. I'm surprised they haven't made a movie based on "The Forgotten Soldier" by Buy Sajer. This movie shares the cold with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
