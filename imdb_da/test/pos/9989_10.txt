I thought this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn't do so much. Special effects were excellent and this film is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to see twice or more in a row. This movie just absolutely everything else I've ever seen. It was all I would expect from a movie. I just loved it. It was also quite kid-friendly. This movie helped me realize that when you think about it, everything is possible. I would give it a clean 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Totally amazing. Loved it.
