Well, I can be biased as I grew up seeing a VHS copy of this movie that is now ready to snap and just spent the last few hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday print for my dad . The movie is so harmless and unofficial it suits all ages .... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and I used to work in the Disney Store !!!). The characters are fun and the prize for the best scene is a tie between the disturbed wedding (especially Swat's musical talents, fly and smack mosquito) and the amazing nightclub scene. The musical tracks still have me humming 20 years after I first saw it. There is no other movie that I can better recommend while baby-sitting, and indeed every child I know (thanks to my Hoppity loving parents) has seen this movie many times. It will always get top marks for its amazing love story, a brilliant baddy and over all originals.
