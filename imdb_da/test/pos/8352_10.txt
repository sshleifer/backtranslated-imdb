This movie is amazing! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is sweet! His little yelps when he's scared and the funniest parts are when: Scamp is trapped under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sing 'I have never had this feeling before'. totally recommend this movie, it comes out on a special edition on June 20th. The deck has scamp on a trash can and Angel under the lid. I just can't explain this movie more than romantic, charming, fun, and adorable. Junkyard scenes are fun, all junkyard dogs have something special. For fun, I laughed, the kids will love it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
