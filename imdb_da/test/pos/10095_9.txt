Three words: Art piece. This movie is just amazing. It's beautiful, sad, scary and thoughtful at the same time. The result remains constant in my head, the play is amazing the scenario scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie more randomly than intentionally. At that time, I decided to watch this movie, I was just bored and reading lists of Asian movies, which might be good. Well I saw the title "A tale of two sisters" that sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided "Don't just watch this movie you have to buy". Said, done. I bought this movie and was hooked from the first moment. <br /> <br /> The reason kept me interested from the beginning to the end; The twist at the end of the movie made me scream. I really didn't see anything like this here. And the final scene made me cry ... it made me cry. It was so sad. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware that the end is as I mentioned earlier a very sad one. But it just fits the mood of the movie, right?
