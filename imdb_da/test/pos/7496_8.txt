OK, so this movie is NOT very well known and was not very well published. I found out that this rather brutal gangster had gone good movie after complete accident on one of Sky's millions of movie channels late on a dull evening, but I'm glad I did! The opening sequence of this movie is fantastic comic in a very dark way. This actually sets what I think is the general tone of the movie. I think many critics and movie fans who have actually seen this movie have been a little unfair to just print it out as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dog's vein, so there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other crime movies genre that it has been compared to, but in fairness I think the movie takes a much darker comic on this type of movie, and the end result is an exciting, well-made, fun, if not entirely original, movie. Tom Jane is good at this and deserves the recognition he will hopefully thank to The Punisher. His performance as the bad guy went well is realistic, fun and just cold enough to make you believe. Casey was really a bad ass before he reformed. It's another thing that makes this movie stand out for me, the characters. In the Nicks band, you get the strangest trio of criminals ever gathered, a smooth, charismatic but very cold leader (Nick), triggering merry blood that loves a sexually-beating female of a woman (Dallas) and a psychotic tray billy Brains with a torture sensation. (Billy Hill) .Good in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on the screen, beautiful over the game by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well on Thursday. It is sometimes dark comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always exciting and worth seeing.
