I had heard about this movie, but didn't see it before my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a good movie. I was interested to see if Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, showed the promise you see in the Potter movies. I was not disappointed. He has become a fine actor who shows a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being knocked down by an indulgent obsessive mother to a young man who finds himself worthy and someone else's. Going over lines from acting and poetry with his aging actress employer, it is obvious that he is ready to take on much more complex roles in film and stage. But the jewel in this movie was Julie Walters. I had seen her earlier in the Potter movies, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and loved her. In driving lessons, as she does lines from poetry and Shakespeare, I was confused by her timing, language control and body language. I hope it was make-up / costuming, as she portrays an elderly woman with osteoporosis, although it is not mentioned in the film - as a nurse, I can say she did it perfectly and portrayed a woman on It's a of the best movies I've seen for a long time, and I wish I had seen it in a theater first - but I doubt it ever played anywhere in Albuquerque. We miss so many of these types of movies here.
