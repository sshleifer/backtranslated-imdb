With the nurse Betty (2000), the renowned indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (in the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough in the big budgeted (Betty's $ 24 million, unlike Company's lean $ 25,000) and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, showing that he can just be it next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be announced to a regular audience this year, and considering her moderate box office and critical success, perhaps movie owners were not as stupid and brainwashed as we were even though they were. The story follows (both figuratively and literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who is in love far away with a beautiful soap star (as good as it gets Greg Kinnear), but is trapped in a loving marriage with a slim car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is horribly murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she is sent to shock and intentionally set off for Hollywood to meet her subject of love - unaware that he is only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they also hit the road and uncomfortable. Fans of LaBute's past work may find it difficult to find out how this could be the same guy who instructed the Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two gruesome sexist pigs playing a practical joke on a deaf colleague - but when you Thinking about it, the connection is quite clear: in a company, a vulnerable woman is not aware that she is ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she is hunting thinks her true worship is no more than a joke. Some may start wondering if LaBute is actually a kind of misogynist himself - given that his recurring theme involves the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he is defending the fair sex and dealing much harder with the abusers in his pictures than they abused. One of the many charms of this film is that it is absurdly full. Most directors, when handling a script like this, would leave the story of two hit men chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and one of the hitmen (Freeman) has also fallen obsessively for Betty. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take because it allowed him to play his trademark "this last last" character (see Unforgiven, Se7en and 1998's Stink Hard Rain); The supportive dust also contains likes like famous Weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and 'Mad About You' Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is terribly over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy or ANY movie for that matter - where a man scales in his own dining room ?). You can argue that the end is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that is good with the movie for a trivial complaint. If nurse Betty is a sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I will do what he decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
