The movie was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering the last sequel. The third was dark and semi-interesting, but it was almost as much fun or fun as this. It's filled with comic lines about Martha Stuart, the doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively under cruel and disturbing images. The movie was not scary or exciting, and I'm sure it wasn't the director's intention. It was fun because of silliness, Jennifer Tilly is over the top and sexy performance. The doll's doll was so well handled, the movement of the mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, knife in the chest and costumes. The dolls were just marvelous, and that made the cruel deaths miserable, given that they were made from wonderful dolls. The new Chucky look was amazing and Tiffany was very sweet. A couple of scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my dad smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well-very attractive and the special effects were cool. The end was so unbeaten, and the fact that they could make another one so good is pretty unlikely. It can't be as exciting as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun!
