A great action movie I have ever seen. That was the first expression I made after seeing it twice on the local TV in my country, Indonesia. A combination of a constant recording and a great choreography played well by David Bradley. He was good here besides "American Samurai". His martial arts skills were performed above average. He managed to make the battle scenes nice to see. Not just punching and kicking as most of the martial artists show in their movie. David Bradley could utilize all the martial arts techniques like throwing, smashing and kicking. Highly recommended for action fans. I have been trying to look for the DVD, but I still can't get that special in my city. Someone could help me?
