This movie is based on a game and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who, against all odds, took home the championship 20 years ago. They have all met for a reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a Junior High Rector, and will quickly get on your nerves with all her whining and regret my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays an unpleasant businessman with just the right amount of "money" excitement. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and seems to be on the brink of some sort of collapse. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, became an alcoholic, and in my opinion, it is excellent in the role. While they all believe in celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousy and struggles are huge. As the men come up with what was, and now they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. It is unusual to have a group of men talk and cry about what might have been and I found it interesting to see them related to each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's certainly good enough to see.
