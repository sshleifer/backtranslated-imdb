In the "goofs" section of this movie, there is a comment that there is an error in continuity, where Augustes car is seen as parked in a place other than seen in a previous shot in the same scene. This is wrong. One of the prospects is from Augustes flat, the other is from Valentiné's flat across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - which can be made for each other - almost cross paths (which happen several times), but it never quite does so until the circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the movie. (And here's the implication that Joseph has manipulated things so that Auguste is on the ferry after inspecting Valentiné's ticket to see what sailing she's booked on.)
