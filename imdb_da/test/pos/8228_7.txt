Doing a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the only movie missing from the list you have seen. One of four films Scott made at RKO during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a thrill around to explode between the trail riders running longhorns in Trail Street, the city's main street and the sod busters feeding our bellies. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step in between the two groups and order the city. More I don't want to say, except that Scott movies usually only have a beautiful girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men who you could look for for their sense of honor, courage, highness and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to a Scott movie with confidence that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this movie, playing a good guy for a change. In fact, RYAN was one of the many WORLD WAR II HEROS in American film. How sad we get these days. George Clooney teaches our youth that we should sympathize with suicide bombers while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much involvement in the shabby left. I wonder how all this plays out in Liberal, Kansas. After all, Liberal was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
