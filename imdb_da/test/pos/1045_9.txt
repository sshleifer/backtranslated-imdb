Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think about it, but it's a relief to see her in a darker hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to wear in "Double Indemnity" the year before. That movie, while the premiere "film noir" and an all-encompassing movie gave her a big role, but oh that hair. Here she is more beautiful and certainly not femme fatal, but she is definitely a 40-year-old woman. She's got used to life without men when most are off in war, and as a successful Martha Stewart columnist, she writes a homely column describing her homeland as the camera pans over what it really is. We meet with his boss, the Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she is living a lie, and when he pushes a Christmas in her supposed Connecticut home, she must come with a man (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we can say "Jingle Bells". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall steps in to help and end up in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not Goulash, it's Irish Stew". Sakall simply takes peppers, pours most of it and says, "Now it's goulash," completely changes what she's made for lunch. So, when it comes to flapjacks, he and her scoops flip. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use the line every time pancakes come up in a conversation. "I don't flip. I scoop!" She won't even turn one to the Greenstreet and say, "I've never turned to life." O'Connor can get her nerves when she screams again and again in some movies, but here she is lovely, and her mating with Sakall is very charming. It's obvious in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwood's cup of tea, especially when she meets beautiful Dennis Morgan, who is a little dimwitted when bathing the baby eating soap, which makes Stanwyck a little disturbed. He suspects something right away, but doesn't. But it doesn't matter. The movie is so charming with the country's surroundings filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs, and a dog running toward them as the sled comes up. Living in New York City after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of New York State made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is also exquisite, there's something about looking at a snow-covered wood field and getting an occasional glimpse of deer, rabbits or other game. <br /> <br /> This is a great holiday movie that can also bring Christmas spirit out of season and make a good pairing with another Barbara Stanwyck Christmas Day, "Remember the Night," an undervalued gem. Add on the big city Christmas "Meet John Doe" and you may have found one of the busiest stars of holiday movies around.
