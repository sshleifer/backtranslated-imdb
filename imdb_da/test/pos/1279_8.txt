An uneven man, known as Bill, lives in a small boring apartment with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall and his typewriter for business. Only the man cannot think of anything to write. He walks around the streets for people just to see where they are going. Perhaps this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well-dressed man with a bag. He follows him for a few days. In a cafe, the well-dressed man sits at a table on the opposite side of Bill and asks why Bill is following him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb tells Bill so surprisingly that he is a theft and even begins to take Bill with him into houses to steal things; Even though Cobb insists he doesn't go into someone else's home just to steal. He says he likes letting people know he's been there and interrupting the things they take for granted. He puts knickers from another burglary in eg. A pants. <br /> <br /> The movie is also told in flashbacks. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his latest feature Memento. Bill finally chooses to cut his hair and dress in a dress on the advice of Cobb. He meets a blonde lady in a club who used to dance the owner, a bald man who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man therefore men on a man's fingers in the Blonde Lady's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they all fit together when we come to the surprising conclusion.
