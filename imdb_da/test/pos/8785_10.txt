I really enjoy this movie. It is a glance back in time, as this nation was in fact at risk from nations that either attacked or shared war against us, ie. the Japanese and German. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were outstanding in the lead. The supportive cast ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also excellent. The direction, pace and final are kept and continue to hold my interest. So much so that I bought my own copy. Many thanks for Turner Classic Movies, they show so many of the really classic movies, including this one. <br /> <br /> Robert Cummings was certainly no lightweight as an actor and although I am a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors who were first starred, I do not see what they wanted brought to the role that would have surpassed Bob Cummings' performance. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I enjoy watching repeatedly and encouraging others to watch.
