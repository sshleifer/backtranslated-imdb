I loved catcher in the rug, it happens to be my favorite book. JD Salinger, the author of catcher, has the rights to the book and made it so that no one can make a movie about it with his permission. <br /> With that said, her "United States of Leland." Beautiful movie of great importance and depth of emotion. but much of it reminded me of catcher, almost too much reminded me of catcher. the few stories that Leland told in the film, such as visiting New York and his adventures, looked much like the team in catcher, and the way Leland looks at people and emotions is similar to Holdens, they are both simple and true to themselves and others. The manager is credited to Don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy. great editing, everyone coincides perfectly and loved the story all. recommend as a purchase or at least a rent. good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing it does is draw on some points, but it does it in the long run. Give it time and appreciate a good movie.
