Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- Kind of Hard to Believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening picture, but still a great battle of both men Edge, whether you like or not, is a great performer in the ring and Shawn Michaels is just timeless when it comes for his performance The Undertaker vs Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK, after a good opening match, now this which crappy match. Undertaker has made some great matches at Royal Rumble, and 1998's Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match, but it's far worse than the same. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's okay, I feel all three men could have given a better performance, this just didn't really show them good. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs Triple H. The World Heavyweight Championship-9 Triple H gets a clean win, you can believe he is taking Sledgehammer out but doesn't use it. Randy Orton did well when he seemed like a concussion, but how he got concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this fight, this was the best performance I've seen from HHH forever. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7- This was very entertaining and I usually don't score the royal rumble match this high. The winner is again very predictable, but this particular had many moments that were very entertaining to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are fun the best segments I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great PPV and a must own for wrestling fans.
