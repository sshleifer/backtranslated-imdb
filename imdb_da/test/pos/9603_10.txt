.... could ITV not release this absolute classic because it would show their current series of Mike Bassett for what it is? When I discussed Mike Bassett with some colleagues, I mentioned the Bostocks Cup as a much better deal and was surprised to find out I was the only person in my entire office who actually saw it. This may not be true for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's see, ITV doesn't have the biggest latest record of producing comedy, so you'd think they'd jump at the chance to repeat at least something that's really fun. Maybe, if it could be combined with a lucrative phone competition, where we think the wheelchair will go next time, they may be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on ITV, there are still some of us out there who would like to see original, quality comedy / drama. Do the decent thing. Then repeat it on DVD.
