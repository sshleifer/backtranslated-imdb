I had a terrible day, but this movie grabbed me and I couldn't put it down to the end ... and I had forgotten my terrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where's the successor !!! the budget is of course extremely low ... but ... see what they did with it! It reminds me of a game ... they basically work with a tent, an "escape pod", a few weapons, uniforms, camping gear and a "scanner" thing. It is for props. Perhaps it is even a good thing that forces the actor to step up and take their rightful place in film, as the workers' centers, instead of thought, used to have an excuse to make starwars (CGI) games. <br /> <br /> Cgi is fine. It's not exactly 'seamless' ... but imho still works. Why? Because there is not too much of it and what is, is not 'to take over' with an army of effects, house people are trying to clamp everything they can in the shot. it begs the imagination ... there are some relatively simple things with a decent composition (especially the large cargo ship .. there is a long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... that tracks the entire ship's length ... It must be a record for the sci-fi sequence film production in the last 10 years, to get an action sequence lasting longer than 0.75 seconds and some relationship to the story. It may look like old or not "state of the art", but it doesn't look silly and it doesn't take away from history. The action is good unless the characters die to quickly get to know them. The captain was great, but some of his scenes could have used another take. I was also confused with his character, who lost his cool and stomped on a corpse, I like to think captains are quietly cool and in control ... what happened in that scene? Did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot .... most are good ... why? Because it doesn't try to explain itself. It just happens. It's called the 'planet', it's a mystery, get it? No one knows why there is a statue, and they do not find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird researcher with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And thank God, it's not a star wars. No midichlores, no 5 minute show deadly dialogue that has no meaning in history. The characters are stranded and can only figure out a few basic things ... it's not a star trek episode where they find out that it is Leonardo Davinci or a child like Space Wanderer. It's mysterious, and I liked it. I do not know why, perhaps I can identify with these guys more, as they do not know what is happening, nor do I ... they do not speak much about space vultures or have magical boxes telling them what is happening. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" turns on the crew and tries to "explain" the cause of the planet, the cult, etc. This randomly has some of the weakest dialogues , imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupts the stream and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes I felt it was a little too mysterious. How did the guy roast through his eyes with lightning strokes? It was weird. Just weird. "Hamlet" ends ... again I wanted to know some of these characters better. And would it have been so difficult to get a 30 second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show, it was a movie, and we like movie closure even though they can get a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without "angel flights singing you to your rest" <br /> <br /> Anyways. What can I say. This was well worth the dollar I paid on the "red box" machine in the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3. As I said, it sucked me in and wanted to know what happened and I couldn't stop looking to the end.
