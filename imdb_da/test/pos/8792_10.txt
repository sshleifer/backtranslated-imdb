I just love this movie! I love all shapes and I can see it again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I use to listen to the soundtrack over and over again. Although I have seen it in two years since it was done and I <br /> <br /> have never been as young as Jip and Company, I can <br /> <br /> understand them and I love their stories. And if anyone thinks this movie is shit, I disagree and I say it's full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy it!
