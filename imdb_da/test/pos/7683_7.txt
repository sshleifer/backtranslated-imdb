I've been waiting 30 years to watch this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my 20s. Recently I found a reasonably priced DVR and I saw it this morning. It was widescreen, probably even a 70mm print, stereo, the colors were quite good, very little fading, certainly not remastered, but I am very pleased with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's pretty good. I won't say it's great, even though there are amazing scenes in it. Perhaps Premminger may not have been the right instructor for it, but I say so. For me, the central part of the movie was the hurricane scene. Marvelously staged by Premminger. One of the fantastic weather scenes in general. In fact, I will go so far to say that the scenarios are better than the musical scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. Not at all. They lacked ... anything though. Perhaps it was that there are no close-ups and very few medium-sized shoots. It was almost like watching a movie recording a stage production. Perhaps it was the feeling that Premminger was following. In the end, it may not have been the right choice, but then it goes. It's far from a broken movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, not all the songs love the soundtrack either. I've always. They are perfect for this movie. I love the singing voices. The actors lip-sinking is excellent for the most part. I just wished the song was staged more imaginatively. Sportin 'The two figures are fine, but the intimate numbers do not even feel intimate. They just feel ... far away. In spite of that, you can't deny the power of music. And in the end, that's what comes through loud and clear. Once again it was perhaps what Premminger was trying to do, being out of the way of the incredible music he worked with. I think he had the right idea, but maybe went too far in that direction. The action is amazing. Top kudos goes to the great Brock Peters who performs and sings that part of Crown. He is the ultimate meany. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he doesn't. As proud, arrogant and uncomfortable as he is, Sammy Davis Jr's classic release of Sportin 'Life is the smooth devil himself and a very charismatic one in it. Perhaps Davis is the best film-maker. Bad Bess just can't handle two bad men. I'm glad Hermes Pan gave Davis a tape dance number to do. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, who are apparently not impressed with being in the movie, are really very cute together. I don't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than there was between Dandridge and Poitier. Yet it has worked out fine for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> Even so, I think they should both be proud of the work they did on this movie. They both managed to bring more than one tear to the eye. Their characterizations how much 3D and credible. However, Sidney Poitier's Porgy seems almost out of place in a marine catastrophe. I couldn't imagine he was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love", very educated and well-spoken and spoken, fallen on hard times. He probably wouldn't have been my first choice for Porgy, but hey, he was a big star at that time, so why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, actually even more vulnerable this time. Carmen was probably the better part for her. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, it's actually two sticks that I wouldn't call a classic. It just doesn't make the ultimate classical class. Yet there is no reason why the Gershwin property has decided to keep this beautiful movie, even with all its faults, hidden by the public as they have. Premminger may have made some odd choices as an instructor, but the film is nothing to be ashamed of and embarrassed by everyone involved in it. That's what it is and there are much worse movies than this that is embarrassing on DVD and in theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
