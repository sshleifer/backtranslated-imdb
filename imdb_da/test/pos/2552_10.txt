Ramin Bahrani creates a scene early in the Chop Shop, which immediately made me identify with where Ale (Alejandro Polanco) character and his friend came from. The two come on a metro and as soon as the doors close they ask if they can get everyone's attention in a moment and that they sell candy bars or M&M or something, and then they continue selling some bars. If you (like me) have ever been to a metro station in New York City, it is the kind of situation that happens so often that you hardly notice it. Often people on a metro want to see children like these or minorities selling something or advertising and talking about something on a metro and not paying them anything. Bahrani focus is not necessarily just on kids who are hocking things for sale on metro rides, but on survival and the condition being one is in when in the lower class in America. It is subsequently in his hands, thought-provoking and heartbreaking, usually immediately. <br /> <br /> To compare it with Pixote or Bicycle Thief is not too far from a jump (actually in the latter at least father and son have each other), although Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this character Ali, no older than eleven and working in a car dealership that cleans some cars and helps separate each other and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. But it's not just because we have born some clich√©s, except you know that a brother and sister (more brother) are trying to look after each other. Bahrani makes the story available through the simple aspiration Ali has the kind of goal that can be achieved in his situation: saving enough to buy a used food car that Ali and Isamar can drive themselves. <br /> <br /> It's Al Ali working for, but what Bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work, which Ali must do to make it happen even though its unpleasant things like tearing hubcaps out of tires Cars in the Shea Stadium or at some point steal a purse in a desperate moment. This makes it much more serious a problem when Ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night, making sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He doesn't mention it and pushes it aside, but it's always something that adds excitement, something Ale wants to protect his sister from. It adds to the tragedy when Ale finds out the real price for what it will take to make the food car a profit maker, a cost that just adds to the anxiety he just internalises. <br /> <br /> You can see immediately that Ale is orphaned in a neighborhood like the one in Queensland where the movie was shot - of course, as with a neo-neo-realism work (let's just call it realism) virtually all non-professional actors in parts of the mechanics and workers and the streets - but Bahrani is more focused - so here and now, and that makes the Chop Shop so immediate and tenacious. Not a trace of the melodrama is in the movie, barely enough music accompaniment except the live Latin music comes from cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in additional scenes, just as Ale is awake, but seems as if he is sleeping asleep the first night after he testifies of Isamar's late night tryst, and we see as she knocks in bed, she probably knows he's awake, but can't say a word either. Or in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, as when the man shows Ale how the feed pigeons work. <br /> <br /> It is rough and gritty as one might expect, and it does not give much hope to its protagonists despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. It is also an excellent shot handheld movie where the technique, with many films made in its urban tone and approach, informs and complements the items on the screen and what they do, but it is also never recklessly shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has a fantastic 'reality' cast (Ale was picked from a NYC public school without experience) and knows how not to waste a shot while gaining a brutal artistry just showing what he is showing. It's not God's city or Pixote; It is his own little masterpiece on a character or character, we would normally not give another look to (or a first one button) on the way in a city like New York. If you haven't been moved by Ale and his daily struggle, I don't know what to do for you.
