In one of the best movies this year, Tom Hanks as Congressman Charlie Wilson plays in this Sardinian fun and highly relevant (given reasonably current events) historical comedy drama around the 1980s Afghan / Soviet failure. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan and killed hundreds of people. Why should anyone break? People die, right? No, the reason why the United States was involved through Charlie Wilson was that the Afghans, in fear of being blown up, began illegally entering Pakistan, which again put away Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson in an attempt to correct this situation with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and a fun and robust American spy for the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help Afghan Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet combat aircraft that would attempt to attack their land. Although not a serious Oscar for Best Picture, Charlie Wilson's war is one of the best of the year's many political films. Oscar Winner Mike Nichols provides solid guidance as expected, while Emmy Award Winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) provides a remarkable manuscript that almost flawlessly balances comedy and drama. The action is also great for the most part. Tom Hanks has been delivering his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar nominated tour as a FedEx employee stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes a slimy sign like Wilson and with his trademark charm makes him a sweet guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable as always, but the real enduring performance of the movie is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Probably the finest actor working in the film industry today, Hoffman takes a small supportive role and discovers everyone around him. From his first scene, screaming at his boss before he violently breaks his window, Hoffman sucks you in. The only disappointing cast member is surprisingly overstated by Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts. Hamming her way through yet another movie, Robert's indulgent and over-top depiction of a rich Texas oil lady hits all the wrong notes and is, in most cases, flat annoying. In 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and it doesn't say it doesn't pull in some places, but when it pulls it, it's very short time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, 'Charlie Wilson's War' is not a perfect movie in any way, but it's definitely worth a visit. Grade: B +
