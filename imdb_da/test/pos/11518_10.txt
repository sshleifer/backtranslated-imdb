NEWS'S LIGHTS were the first "all-take" movie that came into a brilliant 57 minutes and directed by Bryan Foy (of the famous vaudeville family). The story has two dopey shavers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) longing for a chance of "big city life" and involving gangsters and bootleg splashes. One of the boys is framed for the murder of a policeman, but is saved at the last minute by a gun mill (Gladys Brockwell). Much of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk, which is run by a villain named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who is watching a beautiful chorine (Helene Costello), which is Landi's pig. Costello gets a short dance, and we hear Harry Downing (made to look like Ted Lewis) sings "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The play ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) to awful (Oakman). A few of the actors muffle their lines, but then proceed to the stage. As mentioned elsewhere, it was supposed to be a short 2-reel and was made on a shoestring budget. Surprisingly, the voices are quite clear, and there is a nice cinematic touch in the silhouette death. <br /> <br /> The movie was a box-office smash, though it was shown as a silent movie where theaters were not wired to the new sound technology. No one expected this little movie to break a fantastic $ 1.3 million. It made short stars from Costello and Landis and launched Palette on his long career as a star actor. <br /> <br /> Co-stars include Mary Carr as mother, Robert Elliott as detective, Eddie Kane as street cop and Tom Dugan as a bully.
