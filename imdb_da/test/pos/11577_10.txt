Since many other users have already explained and commented on the story, I will not. <br /> <br /> But I would like to reiterate that Bardem's interpretation is fantastic, as are the other actors and actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Reading past comments I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not show views as opposed to euthanasia and that this little gift is ridiculed. In my honest opinion, this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many signs moving in a gray zone between loving Ramón Sampedro and wanting him to stay and understand his desire to die. Most of them are the family. For example, Ramon's son-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gené (the social rights activist), who at the last minute tells Ramón to rethink it all. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> There are signs that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramon's brother is clearly against it, like his father ("There is only one thing worse than the son's death, and it has a son who wants to die.") Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed for to make us believe that Ramón is GOD and the pastor is bad. Well, there is no doubt that the scene is cartoon, but that does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramón to continue using arguments that are completely foreign to Ramón's thinking. The priest's speech goes in line with "God gives and God takes", "We are not the owners of our own lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. Comedy stems from the fact that Ramón is an atheist, and the whole priest says to him, therefore, is nonsense. <br /> <br /> This film is antithesis of manicheism, giving the viewer the chance to think about the subject and devise his own opinion. And above all else is a chant of Freedom.
