The baseline is an exposure of the weird American policy. While the theme seems ordinary, what "doing" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of management and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is impressive. It confirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. Dito to the music. The story uses a similar style with vignettes, where the message is filled with double-entenders. A very innovative strategy by the author / director. The excitement of the story is carried to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie was like a good mystery book. Something was "derived"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know what it might be - you had your suspicions; And when the evil was revealed, you let yourself breathe, you hadn't noticed you were in. Saddened, shook his head. <br /> <br /> A story written well and well told. 3 bowl for a young writer / instructor.
