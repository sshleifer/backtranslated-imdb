The relationship between the main characters I thought was very realistic. How the two are involved is trustworthy. It doesn't have as much "Oh yeah right" as most Hollywood movies have. Not to mention how they caught the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I am a trapeze student and I love that they showed how hard it is on the body, hands and yes, the textile burns are brutal! Definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie. I loved it! I'm glad how the movie ended, but I would definitely see more. Be sure to stay through the credits for a special holiday. Amazing scene!
