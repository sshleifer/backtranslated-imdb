Since the last couple of days I have been really hooked on the "Female Scorpion" series and I keep myself over my head because I waited so far ?? which is too long ?? before you buy the whole set. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant action in a row and the incredibly important trumpet in this series is how the authors always came up with something completely new and different for each installment. Never or sooner has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variation when it comes to stories, settings, themes and movie footage. The original more or less qualified as a so-called "Women-in-Prison" flip (but already an atypical), but you cannot categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, as they hardly have any recordings in the prison walls. And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps going with every new episode. The first movie was tough and gritty, while the other was psychedelic and part three is almost mostly melodramatic. Don't let this last description hold you as "Beast Stable" still contains more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing recordings despite the dramatic atmosphere. For example, the open order is absolutely fantastic. Sasori, still a refugee from the law, literally cuts his way to freedom on the subway when there is no other option but to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman who handcuffed her. Her running through the city with the cut arm hanging on her while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the well-known theme song, is just pure and genuine exploitation gold! History continues convincingly with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the metropolis, but the poor things simply cannot escape her past or even new types of pain. Sasori turns to a prostitute, but without exchanging dialogue and taking a job in a sewing studio. Her own delayed brother (!) Impregnates the prostitute while Sasori has problems with the local pimping and underground crime networks. She wisely prevents a chew from taking advantage of her body, encounters a former enemy of the prison, and outrags one of the prostitutes when exposed to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed policeman continues to obsessively obstruct the streets and is looking for retaliation against Sasori. Our multi-talented instructor Shunya Ito communicates all these stories to a strong healthy and never loses sight of the visual aspects or brilliant film styles. "Beast Stable" contains some of the most impressive compositions and brilliant camera angles you can imagine, editing is flawless, and the outer spaces are effectively depressing. Those who know the character of Sasori a little, are aware that the movie seriously lacks memorable dialogues, but it is always widely compensated by Meiko Kaji's wonderful screenplay and threatening grimaces. There is very little sleaze, except for the aforementioned incestuous sub plot, but the short flashes of extreme violence are amazing, and the twisted end is almost too brilliant for words. In fact, I think part three might just be the biggest (or at least my favorite) one of the series so far. My only small and completely irrelevant criticism concerns the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is unlocked in a cage. The bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.
