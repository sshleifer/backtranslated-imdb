I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but so I can sing its prices. I had never heard of this movie (it is so terribly packed that it is easy to see why it might be over), but a good friend suggested it to me and I am so glad she did. It's a gem of a movie. The actors are amazing (Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular) and look like they really have a fun time. Sure at times it was a little over the top, but I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard or so many times in two hours. If you love to laugh then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
