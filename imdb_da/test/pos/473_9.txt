You're alone is a beautiful, almost delicate movie, smartly directed, sharply written with two complex and accurate performances and a twist of an end that no one will see, but will make you watch the movie another time to go back and catch up with all the tracks you failed. <br /> <br /> The story of a high school girl who drowns her depression and awkwardly by working a couple of hours a week as a $ 500 schoolgirl in the hour of "schoolgirl" and the depressed neighbor who discovers her secret and rent her for an afternoon call in a downtown New Haven hotel, have amazing performances by both Jessica Bohl and the girl and Richard Brundage as their neighbor. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on a par with Maggie Gyllenhaal's secretary. She then catches a teenager's fear of growing into her own skin, and when she talks about being in control, you begin to realize that she is not in control at all, but in danger of crossing the deep end that I suppose in a way she does. <br /> <br /> Brundage like Buddy is depressed, sour, heart-shaped, a man's shell. But it is only after the film's exciting conclusion that you understand a full understanding of his pain. After a very short opening segment, which will connect most independent movie lovers and get the religious right to exit towards exits, we are brought into the hotel room. In the beginning, you are not sure of these people or the film-making style. Shaky, annoying ... like the characters. Until you realize their story, told in short feedbacks. They are confrontational at the start of a reason and it is also the camera. But as they open up as the story settles, it also makes the camera. And I do not know, 20 minutes into, giving or taking, you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Just watched world premiere screening at Brooklyn Film Fest - where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not a person answered yes ?? I almost wish the movie was already on video so I could see it again. Because I was thinking of some of the talks in the movie, especially a very honest dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought things were moving in a completely different direction. But I realize now that so much of their conversation meant something completely different to what I had imagined. I'll see it again !!! But just as dark and sexual, so much of the talk is, to put it mildly, I found myself more than I could have expected with any of its desire, which certainly falls into the things we believe but lacks the nerve to say high "category. It is very silly, especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning. Some of it will make you uncomfortable, especially if you see you are alone with a partner. surely have something to talk about maybe argue afterwards. Maybe it should come up with a warning: You must be alone when you see! The music is great. I would have come home and bought the soundtrack on my favorite online music Shop If I Could Have The movie looks as good as any shot on film After screening director Gorman Bechard was asked what kind of process he used to make the digital footage look so good. Don't afford it. <br /> <br /> I have to give Becha rd credit, i'm a big fan of his two shorts, The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they couldn't have prepared me for the complexity and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> To everyone involved: bravo.
