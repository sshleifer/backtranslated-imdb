As many of the other comments I have read have noticed, I fell in love with this movie when I was a child. My sister and I had a copy of the movie on Beta (before VHS) that we hit out. Of course it didn't help when our parents sold BetaMax at a garage sale. Since then we have tried to find a copy. I, like another commentator, eventually found a rental profile on a local video store. The owner would not share with the copy after a number of attempts to beg, bribe and cry my way to owning the tape. GREAT NEWS! I bought a brand new, recently released, VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney is upset. Now if they just want to re-release the song in the south ... If you love the movie, take it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's worth checking out - totally silly humor, but very funny (Stephen Furst is funny).
