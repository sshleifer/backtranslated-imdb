There are, as many reviews have seen, a strong dark touch to this movie. The director who reminds me most of all is John Landis (yes, go and pay tribute to what a farmer I am). Arcand has a gift to explore silly things in a gloomy, gray way and then turn around and explore the horrors of life with a lightning touch. The game is without average above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is excellent as the humble and confident center around which the rest of the characters are concerned. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to watch him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner of Criminal Minds. <br /> <br /> Maybe not the best scene, but the one I enjoy the most, my "rewind scene" is the section where Candy expects a visitor and an uninvited person after the other appears at the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment swings more and more out of control, David grows just bouncier, perkier and more enthusiastic, like a madman Gen-X "Tigger".
