I don't know what the critics looked at when this movie was released, but it got rid of them unnoticed. It's well-written, witty, satirical and thoroughly enjoyable. It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next time. The violence is not free or overdone for splatter effect. One last word: For you Mickey Rourke fans ... Mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.
