I sympathized with the first man's condition, Schmitter, we see killed in this episode. He reminded me of the horror of being a lonely security guard at night somewhere - the kind of work I did shortly in 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to a sharp, colonial chief (Lynch) happy to describe. The monster in the dark here, killing members of a deep mining colony, creates a frightening impression in the first action. We don't really see it in the early stages, and as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left behind by imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is a voiced description, but it actually turns out to be a large, lumpy pepperoni pizza that slides along the ground like a silicon twist - a limitation on the show's budget, unfortunately. This also shows in the latest food painting famous for Trek fans, the only way to convey a long shot to the mining industry. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about what is inside, rather than outer appearances. Sure, this Horta, a newly discovered silicon-based way of life, looks like a mindless monster at first glance. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mind meld for plot purposes), we learn it is an extremely intelligent, even sophisticated, being. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy replaces his usual medical routine - healing a creature reminiscent of stone or asbestos. He also gets to say one of his most famous lines: "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!" I found it very true in his scene, telling in his success, though he can't make Kirk share with his enthusiasm - Kirk is too busy to organize results. The episode throws unexpected turns in character and motivation for the audience as the story progresses; Spock fights the need to possibly preserve this discovered life as Kirk takes his usual stance to prevent death on any red shirt (no half-measures as in "The Man Trap"). But later it is Kirk who for some reason sticks to shooting a killing blast, as if the hunts were turned off, and he had time to reflect on Spock's point (I think it was during this episode's movie that Shatner learned that his father was dead). Uncharacteristically for most of the first season, this has a good ending. The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as Achieving standard quotas as opposed to protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a space age version of the protection of owls from tractors with modern advances. Somehow despite many murders and a feeling that everything could go to hell at any time with a raised phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to mediate an agreement that meets everyone. I think people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
