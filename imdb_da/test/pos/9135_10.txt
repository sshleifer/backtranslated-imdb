Jean-Pierre Melville is a director, I have only recently become acquainted (I will see Bob Le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to fully understand them), but to see Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, allegedly based on a saying in Buddhism) I realized that I was knowledgeable and absorbed a crime film that I had seen for a while. Although his film has dialogue, it is mainly to keep the movie's scenes rolling together, according to the plot. What kept me aware, even in seemingly earthly scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on the character's movements or behavioral patterns. Melville has his story laid out, and he is cautious about taking his time to tell it (it may seem boring to some, but it seems to work as he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environments over the plot) . <br /> <br /> Look, however, at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, scolding a new lift), Gian Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping and on the lamb from the hand-cuffed custody, encounters Corey with luck), Yves Montand as Jansen (an old pro with years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel) and Andre Bourvil as Matthew (an experienced investigator looking for Vogel, and on his toes with internal Affairs). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and they each have their own kind of moments that show to the audience what their personalities might be like criminals and the police. The Heist sequence gives some advice, such as how Vogel cops-a-feels from a female statue as he walks down the halls, or how Jansen takes a flask out and just has a whiff of content (and what a dream this guy creates). Even Corey's movements, involving a photograph of a woman, arouse interest. <br /> <br /> As absorbing and cool becomes the story, and just as well the skills to make it happen (via film photographer Henri Decae, editing and musical score of Eric Demarsan) are the folks on the screen who get fascination in how they stay true to their nature and ideals. Not a movie to miss French New Wave enthusiasts, and modern film criminals today may take the 140 minutes to enjoy the atmosphere of Melville's work. A suave piece of film making that is still one of my favorites all the time.
