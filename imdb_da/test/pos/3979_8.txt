I was very eager to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew it was going to be another type of movie in Nerd's state of revenge, I was still impressed. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of truth about this type of learning and strongly believes that it should be allowed in a "new school". <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching forms do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching must be further pursued in true academic courses. <br /> <br /> While there were still too many party scenes, it should of course be thrown in there - for Hollywood's sake in making a comedy about college ... even though we all know that life is not such a thing any way. <br /> <br /> A touch of incredible, still fun and with a killer ending. <br /> <br /> Amazing end. Crucial to the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the movie would have been half as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, and it didn't have too much swarms or nudity or gross jokes for it to be good. <br /> <br /> Great crew and cast, history and even the generic typecasting of the mandatory "Hampton frat members" were well done. /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or whatever clones it makes do not measure up to this by 1/3. Far better than most comedies in first year College with no one I was happy about it even though it was simple ... it was interesting and even had heart ... my only regret to see this movie is that it was no longer.
