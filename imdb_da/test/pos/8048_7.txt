Epic early film directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister and their dogs are orphans - they have to live with an uncle. On board, their coach is young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, celebrating the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her she can't keep the dogs and they are laid out. There are Native Americans nearby; and Indians love to eat dog meat (not fun?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Mrs Marsh who wants to help her restore the running dogs. While saving puppies, an Indian shot - resulting in a confrontation of "Cowboys vs. Indians". <br /> <br /> This "Saga of the American West" is definitely an important movie; However, the reliable Griffith practitioners begin to overlap their hands and the story is too confronted. Many of the Griffith elements are in place - some good, and a few bad ones. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" overshadows the later epic, "The Nation's Birth". <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
