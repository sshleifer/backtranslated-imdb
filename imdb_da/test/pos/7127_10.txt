This movie is so wonderful it captures the game life. I laughed so hard as I looked at this. The film is about a game group that has difficulty with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with. The movie changes from the real world and the game world as they play the campaign that shows them in the game world as their character, then switches back to the real world when they don't play. The campaign is the foundation of a module written by the dungeon master, Lodge. The problem is the Lodge cannot finish its module because the characters cannot finish the campaign. They are more to kill and rob instead of role playing. The lodge wants them to play role-plays through the campaign, as they have never done before. They decide to bring some extra help so they bring one, wait for it, girls in to play. The lodge also does an npc, a non-player character, a paladin who can't witness or do wrong, to play. The movie is how they do all this, and more, I don't want to spoil any of the movie, so I won't say more. This movie cannot be a big budget movie. It may not be worthy of Oscar, but if you are in play or in dungeons and dragons then look for sure. They had a lot of fun making this movie, and it shows that I won't bash on it for any movie issues like continuity or anything, it was a low budget movie that's just fun. There is some slap stick comedy that I enjoy and something wonderful to write in my opinion. So if you want a fun movie, try it.
