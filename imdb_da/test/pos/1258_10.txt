The Kid is a really good family film about an oblique picture consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is that he doesn't have much of a social life that no one seems to like as he is not always very nice. One day if things are changing when an eight-year-old version of itself appears magically. This gives Russ a chance to do things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a lovely, heartfelt movie for everyone.
