This is definitely one of the most frightening and spelling films ever made. You are stuck in the movie from the beginning to the end. Although there are some plot holes, it is still exciting for the final showdown. Besides "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", this is one of the best films about "Snuff Movies", a taboo theme for our culture. If you like SCREAM Trilogy, you'll probably love it.
