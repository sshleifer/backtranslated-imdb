Blind Spot images are great. The action pulls you all the way in, even though the film is a bit long. At the final credit, all you can think of is the film's positive highlights. The main players have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The movie score is nicely underestimated. Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the exciting story and amazing visual compositions. Hope you get the chance to watch this movie. It dives into some dark area, but you come out of the tunnel and see nothing but white light.
