This is the best version of gypsies who have been filmed. Bette Midler is simply amazing as Mama Rose. She has the voice, the excitement, the look and most of all a high-impact ability to carry the role and make her character come alive.Here sings are simply set: MAGNIFICENT! She shines especially in two numbers - "Everything's Coming Up Roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are also fine, especially Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert, his portrayal of Herbie is recorded with great style and credibility. The film is very good. There is no false note or gaffe throughout the production. This movie is a great improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962. When I see it again, I can say that the three greatest mum roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie. You will be glad you did.
