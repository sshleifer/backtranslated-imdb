Father (78) and I (46) both were happy to see the girl today. For a guy primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it helps to get his previous movie images to play against. Consider one of these roles, 15 minutes, was a policeman who had to deal with the interference of the mass media and you have an interesting set of comparison / contrast performances. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley's kind of characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world self, best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK. It is interesting to see how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictitious colleagues in television and film. Shatner talks about the right means to slip over a car hood; De Niro points out the holsters scratch hood finish. Ironically, you begin Niro's character to incorporate the illusions of the television cop reality into the real world case he's working on as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The film draws its inspiration from a spectrum of sources so you could make the comment it's derived. Well then what? Satir must derive his humor to exist. And besides, the film has splendid moments of originality. For example, I am reasonably certain that the method of death of the villains has never been done before. <br /> <br /> An argument about the reality of the weapons involved - shouldn't these weapons have had any kind of decline? In order to penetrate steel, these balls must have sufficient inertia to penetrate. And every ball's highest fatigue is at the shot. So .... shooting a volley of these tank-killer balls should have pushed the sliders back on their butter. Oh, what dunk ... it's a satire. Perhaps the guns' lack of recoil is even a satire on the B-F guns that are used so randomly in thrillers. <br /> <br />
