Forget Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that quite a few of the reviews I've read on the box correspond to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a light to Darko. It's not that I disagree with it necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a completely different animal and deserves its own analysis. There are comparison points to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you think the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the story is existential. In the box, the driving force behind the story comes from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say I understand the propensity to compare an innovative filmmaker's movie by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to first approach each new movie as a standalone entity and then expand my gaze afterwards. <br /> <br /> Boxing is one of those movies you get mixed feelings because it seems to be in some kind of identity crisis. It is not always certain what it will be. The turns are numerous, but easy to follow if you don't predict it. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively credible pair of newlyweds who are on financial lines. A box containing a "button unit" arrives just outside the door and they are informed by a horrible burned man that pressing the button will result in a person's death which they do not know and will receive a million dollars . One of the things the box achieves is to induce this invisible fear that somewhere out there, our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pressed, it has a frightening and seductive quality, prominent yet spooky. Once it has been pushed, events have been initiated that cause the two leaders to ask their own morals and deep regrets on their destructive decision. <br /> <br /> The notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because it gives me a paradox. If there are external beings that develop an "altruism coefficient" based on data collected by couples pushing and not pressing the button, then when the conspiracy breaks, we note that it is ultimately a forced altruism: Be selfless or the species will be wiped out. I suppose the couples do not know the consequences of their actions when they face the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistic? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when we have a problem in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological obstacles in this movie are everywhere. Press the button or not, it is likely that someone is throwing with you. Take the money or not, no one gives anything away for free. Search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your death. <br /> <br /> I suggest the box is an ironic work because it gives the false choice of free will while revealing that we are caught in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of the lives of others, is that freedom? No, it's just another box, because then you get caught up in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on the ground and it is another box. It is precisely for this reason that the outer beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand that we abide by the moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We made it to Mars, and we were burned for it and became slaves in a diseased game. <br /> <br /> The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the last chamber for free or not." Certainly, however, whatever form we enter into the chamber, it is still a chamber. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
