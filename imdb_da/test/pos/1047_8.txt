A leaf column that writes about life at her farmhouse when she actually lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it becomes an entertaining little screw basketball comedy thanks to a fine molding. In a major departure from her former role as a femme fatale in "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck shows a lovely comic flair. Morgan is smooth as the beloved war hero, while the Greenstreet is well cast as a publisher. Sakall, however, steals the movie as a cook trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
