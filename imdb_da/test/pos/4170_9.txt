My friends and I went through a period when we wanted to rent movies that neither of us had ever heard of. The only good thing that came from it was this movie, "Take it to Limit" just as the movie started, we could tell that we were in a real classic. The music is probably made by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds like the early 90's rap. Star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad boy as well, especially sporty a big zit the whole movie. This movie is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but even I think it's fun when they have the climber struggling to climb, and there's a guy in the background who basically goes up the 'cliff'. You will not miss this movie, you will see the same clips over and over again. You get surprises at every turn. You will find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take it snow. Disclaimer: This movie is poorly finished, but that's what it does well
