(May contain spoilers) I am disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. Although it is certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The action and the photography are excellent. Some of the musical figures are great; including the title number "Where am I going?", "Easy to be hard" and "Black boys / White boys". Even though I haven't seen the scene musically, I think it shoots many people's judgment. This is not the musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical might have been sensational to see, but it would never have had the same effect on movies, so a plot had to be added. And the end that's been added is just amazing. The film made me feel that I had actually seen something important, unlike most of today's films that only satisfy one level.
