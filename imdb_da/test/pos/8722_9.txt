What an absolutely charming movie. The molding is wonderful and the story is witty and fun. A very comfortable movie experience. Although the plot is a little predictable, it doesn't make the story any less fun, in fact I didn't want it to end. I have always been Ingrid Bergman's fan, and I was interested in seeing her in a comical role. She didn't let me go, Ingrid Bergman's performance as Mrs Dickinson is fun to see. I loved her interaction with Toni in the music business as well as her dance and the "dentist". It only turned out what I already knew she was one of the greatest actresses all the time. Goldie Hawn is also lovely to see. Her funny, gentle and lovable Toni is the driving force of the film. You don't even ask why she would be so concerned about her Finacee's wife, you just accept that she's just the kind of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was too. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never create a sense of victory for the viewer, in fact they almost make him more lasting. There was no unlikely sign in the pile. This movie has decided with the time test, I saw it last night, and I think it is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a fun, light-hearted, romantic comedy look no further.
