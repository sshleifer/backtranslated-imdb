Insane well-designed mini series. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of it twice when it appeared on the American Playhouse at PBS. Was greatly promoted at the time. I think it could have been one of the very early mini-series featured on PBS outside the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> Full-length production was shown I believe only once during its first release. Was 6-8 hours in total. This length was edited slightly down to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. I very much hope that people who keep their current rights follow and restore a complete, non-edited DVD version. Not worth creating a VHS version at this time. <br /> <br /> Must be very good in the miniseries or the dramatic story genre.
