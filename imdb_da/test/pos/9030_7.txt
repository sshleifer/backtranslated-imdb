Had it not been to kill a mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. Had it not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the play here would be much more calm. Had it not been for William Faulkner, it might never have been written in his shadow perhaps to kill a mockingbird. <br /> <br /> I found this movie boringly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, Two Kill a mockingbird, might not have been as original as I always thought it was. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar film. Oh, "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lonely fair "white" lawyer against a white south town defending a black man is far too familiar. And written by a woman, Mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman, while this film concentrates on brother against brotherhood, the rape feels like a man of brotherhood betrayal. There is no depth of Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with its presence. So you're right back with the sadness that if she wanted to lift the plot from this movie or not, Harper reflects Lee's Mockingbird. Nothing has changed over the ten or so years since the time she might have read Faulkner's book and watched her movie while in college in Alabama and unknowingly or not, took most of her as his own in recent years. Nothing changed in race conditions, and some may say that nothing has changed itself now, many years later. It is all too boringly familiar, and you want an Addicus of our day to do it okay. Where Mockingbird leaves you hoping for it, swings in Addicus's arms and waits for a morning of better times, this movie just leaves you sorry that black people's pride may correspond to or better white people's pride. But pride is also no answer. Rather, it is Addicu's answer that we need, comforting that we are all flawed, and that in our fragility we should have mercy, not pride, when they turn every second into our differences.
