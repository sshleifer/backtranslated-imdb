Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), his poor boy brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), his girlfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her girlfriends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to another city ​​to see an important game. They decide to camp in a field halfway and continue their journey the next day. However, the fan belt breaks in Wade's car and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a close-up town where there is a house of wax. When they arrive at the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two interwoven former Siamese brothers have transformed people into wax statues. I liked this "House of Wax", actually a worthy teen horror movie. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash movies, and it's well done, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects, and death scenes are amazing. Although the movie was not good, it is worth seeing the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The House of Wax")
