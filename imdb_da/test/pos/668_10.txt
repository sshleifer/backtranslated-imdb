Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints from both the audience and the people who attended. But nothing he has done has managed to create more controversy than this. 2001 Brass Eye Special. Prior to arriving at the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera, Brass Eye Special kept the record for most complaints received on any television program ever broadcast. <br /> <br /> The huge number of complaints made to the public by Brass Eye Special was incredible! Many complaints were spoken by people who never even looked at the program! The subject that the program handled showed many heads, but the message was very misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that smoothed the subject of pedophilia. The show was exclusively about the media, and it is the presentation of the subject. Morris, is and always will be a mediasatistist. The notion that the program "makes fun" of pedophiles and children who have been abused is absolutely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do such a thing. He only draws attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype around the subject. <br /> <br /> With many of his established 'Brass Eye' characters, such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows just how much media overflows every little thing about a topic they created and built themselves, and the result is so fun if it's not more fun than anything Morris has done before. Using his proven formula, Morris manages to trick several lovable celebrities into believing they are working on a serious documentary. In fact, they are made to look exactly like what they are. Retarder. All in all, Brass Eye Special should be seen as being believed. And with an opening line, Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
