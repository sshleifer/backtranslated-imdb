After the release of 'Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937)', Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce quality animated feature-length children's films, many of which I still haven't had the pleasure of watching. 'AristoCats (1970)', directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film in Disney's official cannon and is a romantic musical comedy about a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910. In the ancient Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (pronounced by Hermione Baddeley), her loving cat cats ?? including duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens ?? are the most important residents. When bumbling butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), learns that cats stand to inherit the old lady's entire fortune, he sets out to dispose of pets and dumps them in the countryside far from the big city. Lost and confused, the Duchess and her children get acquainted with a sweet talked hook, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. <br /> <br /> Animated, 'The AristoCats' is not particularly remarkable, with much earlier Disney movies like' Snow White ?? and 'Fantasia (1940)' demonstrating a similar or even superior visual style. However, the story is interesting and exciting ?? especially for younger audiences, i bet ?? and the songs {which I wish were more numerous} are fantastic. For trivia I am due to my two favorite songs such as "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody will be a cat", the latter being a psychedelic backlash to the late 60s with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colors, led by a trendy cat called Scatman Crothers (Scatman Crothers). The family's journey back to Paris is eventful and adventurous, and we meet as friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese}, Uncle Waldo {the couple's enchanted relative}, Georges Hautecourt {Madam Bonfamille's old but spraying lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette { two dim-witted dogs dogs with a hunger for the butler's mother's tracks}.
