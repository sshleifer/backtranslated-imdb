I thought it was a very good TV show and I want to see it continue. It got really interesting at the end and I really want to see where it goes from there. Sometimes we are quick to kill a series without giving it a try. I think this needs a chance to continue, and I will definitely wait for it. The sea is one of the places you know so little about, and I think it's a mystery in itself. What awaits us during the world's waters. It is even said that man might crawl out or spread out of the waters many millennia ago. Is this a new development coming? Should we move down the food chain or fight for our position?
