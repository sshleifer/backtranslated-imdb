Containing Billy's famous humor, this more humble comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a great departure, pleasantly unexpected, so for Billy Crystal. This movie has various tears-dramatic, serious underlying themes (especially with a scene with Steven Seagal). This film was both entertaining and serious, a film about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, friendship and values ​​with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as with the new classic genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's talent scout / agent character in Romania by a giant man is revealing, and behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. But the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. Eight out of ten stars.
