I agree with Andy, it's a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is credible throughout the film. We have to hate him and eventually sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also puts a good performance. It is thought-provoking and emotional without any slush overproduction. Payment to director Alison Peebles and author Andrea Gibb for that. A very worth seeing. The pace of the movie is just right and gives just enough interest in the subject to put you instead of bombarding you with facts in a documentary style. Nice little soundtrack to go with the movie too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from the story. Recommended.
