I'm not going to stumble about it, but I just need to make it short. basically for those who do not know how prue actually died ........... the first time around the demonic assassin comes here beeping and confusing an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere. phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, says the stave that sends him away but not overstated. (NEVER BEARING THREE) Leo will heal them both and so on. They are exposed along the line, and the only way they can be saved is for a demon called Tempus to return time. The only way he can do is to keep phoebe in the underworld. She agrees, tempus returns time. it is now around 7:00 in the morning again. demon comes beating beeps and adorns with energy ball. they fly again through the wall again. but this time, phoebe is not there to say the spelling to defend the demon. demon kills doctor doctor flies through window. he is dead. Demon walks in a swirl wing type thing and glass on the doors split, which is a great effect goodbye and there is and airy sound. That's where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world doesn't know if they weren't aware of the next episode. although what i am saying was not shown what is happening, trust me ............... because this time there was no phoebe to call leo this time he comes later. piper survives because her injuries were as mortal as prue and leo heals her only before the prey so at that time prue is already dead. there mystery solved. ps calling a try with a magic should have worked !!! and she should have made a surprise look in the last ever episode.Ok i ramble on
