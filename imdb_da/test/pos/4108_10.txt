I don't look so much wrong with this movie. Granted, the most important singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly hold a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I love to love their songs, especially the "world is a circle", "the things I don't want to miss" and "ask me an answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is terrible and that the snow-covered mountain kits look like they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts. I've seen powdered snow before, and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me. And most of all in this movie's defense, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember it was when I saw it on Christmas Eve a few years ago.) With the whole scream of sex and violence in the cinema These days I find it refreshing to note that this movie deserves its G rating. And they don't say cheeky "F" words every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. So even though this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, it has some redeeming value and I give it ten points out of a possible ten. It's my story, and I stick to it.
