"Everything is enlightened" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel. This version is about changes in Eastern Europe from World War II through post-war war and how the younger generation relates to this story as a family memory. <br /> <br /> Debut Director / Adapter Liev Schreiber retains some of the novel's humor and language struggles, mostly through the wonderful Eugene Hutz as the American gifted Ukrainian tour guide. He is so conspicuous that the film becomes more of his odyssey in his country and family as he goes from his pleasant environment in the sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical, isolated country that has been devastated by conquerors through the Communists and now capitalists, with both Jews and non-Jews as detritus. As fun as his opening scenes are, when he establishes his naughty bravura, he feels later in his own country when he tries to ask local yokels directions. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood as the American tourist as a tight tooth in a visual panoply, as his character is less verbal than one of the narrators in the book. He and Hutz play each other well until the conclusion becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plan. When the grandfather's story takes over the film's last quarter, wonderfully and unpredictably adopted by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not look to any catharsis, as they just clear the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document the story. One of his consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering pre-holocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective. The Czech Republic stands for Ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and the country, as it is now primarily a road movie, and the long driving scenes draw a little. Schreiber retains some of the symbolics of the book, especially of the moon and river, but after cutting the parts of the book explaining them, they just look beautiful out of the atmosphere and no longer represent time and destiny. <br /> <br /> As W.C. Fields would have predicted, the dog steals most of its scenes for easy laughs. Generally, Schreiber goes for more poignancy than the book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book but less morally and emotionally cluttered. <br /> <br /> The movie is hugely revamped by its amazing soundtrack, ranging from songs and instrumentales from Hutz's gypsy band to traditional tunes to modern tracks for Paul Cantelons klezmer fusion score. <br /> <br /> This is not a holocaust movie in itself, there is a kind of mirror image of "Train de vie" as if a time being transported with meaning now, but will reason more with them who has an emotional connection to that story.
