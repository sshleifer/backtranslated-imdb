In this era, when almost everything makes it DVD (I expect to see my mother, the Car Collection someday now), this movie has been unfairly neglected. There are countless stupid comedies from the 60s as well as many other eras that have received at least one short-lived DVD processing. This was not even released on VHS for my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the production (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-authoring Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It is, of course, a product of the sixties, but it is just about everything else from that era. All movies reflect the taste and customs of the times when they are made. This was released the same year as the president's analyst, another absurd masterpiece. The film was finally released on DVD and has developed a sense of culture. This movie has many memorable bizarre, yummy, crazy moments. Sure, it's painted in wide lines and has stupid go-go music throughout, but it's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If the person in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases (I think Columbia releases it) is voting for new releases, it gets my vote.
