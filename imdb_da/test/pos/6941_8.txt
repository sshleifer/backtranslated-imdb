As a Canadian, I didn't know much about the Whitlam dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about these events, but it was about it. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (the fizzled out, fortunately) that could have led to interference by our governor general, the Whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press. In an effort to learn more, I ordered the DVD of this mini series through eBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting the account was. As dramatic as events were, this could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a pretty exciting mini-series. I was also impressed with how understandable it was despite my lack of knowledge of Australian politics. It didn't take long to find out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> That being said, it is not a completely impartial account. Malcolm Fraser is certainly portrayed as a right Machiavellian figure, which leaves no person or thing in the way of his quest to be prime. Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a more noble, almost saintly, light. But the actor, who broadcasts Whitlam, channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more like pumping. I thought Sir John Kerr was portrayed in a rather sympathetic way. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80s, but it seems that nothing was done to restore image quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that nothing extra was added either. A documentary, or even some interviews with the historical figures, would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone interested in reality.
