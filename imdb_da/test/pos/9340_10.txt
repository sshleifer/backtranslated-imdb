Before this clip, music videos were only for showing an artist. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" created a whole new section of music videos that can honestly be called mini-movies. "Thriller" follows a couple as they travel to the girls' house from a movie. On the way, they meet the zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies jump into the couple and the girl turns to see that Michael has become one of them. Then they do a little dance. The frightening thing about "Thriller" may be that it is consistently more fun and fun than many movies made. After twenty years it's the leading music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My music video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet child of mine" 3 - Nine Inch Nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
