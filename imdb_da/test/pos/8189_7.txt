Chen Kaige lost his sense of pace. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the movie without following dialogue with their ears because it is painful to do: slowly, unnaturally heavy and convincing. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation, which manages to lose all the subtlety and dual meanings that make a careful study of the movie so fun.
