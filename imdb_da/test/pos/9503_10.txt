The residents are a band known for their odd looks and strange musical stylings, so of course their music videos won't be quite normal. In fact, these small videos are abnormal and bizarre, but have a huge artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful images. It's an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix only consists of many music musicians made for their songs. The music itself stretches from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it is straight out of an 80's horror movie. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are fantastic! <br /> <br /> Any fan of the art film will love these. They are so original with their images and the angles they are filmed on, and the lighting makes it especially interesting. The music is scary and captivating and very original and these short films are mini-classics that deserve more observations. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** out of ****. 56 minutes.
