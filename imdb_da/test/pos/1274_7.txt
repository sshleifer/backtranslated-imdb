A surprisingly good movie considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors competing with top talent on the planet (unfortunately no one has told a career). <br /> <br /> Also includes Christopher Nolan's god-like ability to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what bears this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people to material for his books. Well shot, very well edited, even better written and incredibly well done. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything a big movie needs, except people who have seen it. 9.10
