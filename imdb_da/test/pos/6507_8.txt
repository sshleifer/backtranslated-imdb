The failure of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of chirp and the transformer's scratch, raised a couple of eyebrows, but it is good to see that he did it for the DVD's enhancement. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, as the former chronicled grunge phenomenon of the 90s in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary on the hip hop DJ's world and the development of turntable. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores modern American graffiti culture. After a couple of views four years ago, my DVD had been dusting since, but recently I saw it again and in addition to the subject I was surprised at how well shot and edited this documentary is. An extremely enjoyable soundtrack too and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. One of the best things about the movie is that it mainly investigates where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001 it is) without ignoring the pioneers of course. Good things. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
