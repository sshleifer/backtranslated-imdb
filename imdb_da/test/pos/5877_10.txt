This amazing 40-year-old post-war classic tends to overlook these days. When released in 1945, it cleared 1946 <br /> <br /> Oscars, mostly at the expense of `It's A Wonderful Life. 'Both films were recorded by Best Movies, Best <br /> <br /> Instructor and Best Actor, all won by Best Year. Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews along with an amateur actor Harold Russell (a reality soldier who lost both hands in an explosion) playing <br /> <br /> Recurring soldiers finding life is much different than what they <br /> <br /> remember. Myrna Loy is fantastic as Mart's wife, who is going to keep the family together while he's gone. The tear shaking <br /> <br /> scene, where March and Loy are reunited, is magnificent. All three <br /> <br /> men find that they have trouble adjusting to post-war warfare, not least Russell expresses with artificial hands and his economy <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell ) Trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted as indifferent if the film does not make any money as long as everyone in America sees the movie so they will appreciate what those men went through. If any movie is worth 10 out of 10, this is it.
