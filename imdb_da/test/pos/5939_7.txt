This was mainly a remake of "Diagnosis Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio & Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches criminology 101 and cannot even find his own classroom. Barry is now a private eye, not related to Dick. This lets Barry shoot at guys who leave him as a police officer can't do. Barry still gets the girl at last. Tracey Needham depicts the girl. She is the primary suspect, and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and proves it. It's all the spoiler you get. The end is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it halfway through the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Don't criticize it. Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
