Saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later. I see it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Does it make a "lifetime movie network"? Yes, but my whole life didn't even live back so it needed some air. <br /> <br /> Casting was excellent. The story was a little skumalty; Two women become close friends and unfamiliar that either a friend has an affair with his other friend's husband. She is invited to the house for an evening party, which is how she discovers that her boyfriend is her best friend's husband. She is horrified and tries to interrupt the case. Shortly thereafter, he is tragically killed in a car accident that is weaning for both women. Of course, unfortunately, wife finds this affair and wants Holly out of her life now, but their friendship is capable of winning because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
