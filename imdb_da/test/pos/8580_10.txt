*Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a real author, is actually still just a boy in his behavior. He does not care about anyone but his own needs and could not care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he teaches Nimi and her ties with her family and her communitiy, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. He begins to realize that he is actually lonely and firm in impersonal structures that are just comfortable, but lacking in heart and commitment. Nevertheless, he looks away from any responsibility and is reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he is already - unconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. She is pushed into the rules of her Nigerian society, its prejudices and its medieval values. Being a single mother is difficult for her position, and it gets even worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the ref is saying), a man who can't commit. The women in the community plan to marry her to the ref to finish her single status and give Sammy a "name". But that would mean for Nimi to abandon all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy accepted and even becomes a respected member of society? <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with very sexy scenes by Matt and Nimi) and a loving child who is eagerly matchmaking, a beautiful nature in vibrant colors. Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show a good chemistry. It's just great to see them. And Fissy Roberts like Sammy is just to die for. You just want to adopt him. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are both on the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about Sex. This scene is absolutely sweet !! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain about .... Wait! It's not true. One thing is not good: That movie is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the reference is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ....) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, by all means!
