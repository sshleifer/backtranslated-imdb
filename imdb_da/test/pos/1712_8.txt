Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon" is often ranked among the biggest silent comedies, at least where short subjects are concerned, and therefore it may come in a bit of a downturn for some. Unlike some of the other renowned classics such as Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant", this movie is, in some respects, a well-known, conventional situational comedy and does not offer much in the way of abdominal traits; One might wonder whether Langdon belongs to such a rare company. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is a perfectly charming comedy in its less important way, and Harry is fascinating to see. <br /> <br /> For a modern viewer who has traveled on the television site, the plot "Saturday afternoon" may suggest honeymooners or its many spin-offs: two stupid guys, one of whom is married and much under his wife thumb, trying to sneak out with a couple of teens for a fun afternoon; But everything goes wrong and they have to fight for the girls hard guy lovers. Does this sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Now the prize was already traded when this film was made, but in addition nothing was typical about Langdon. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep. Any Freudians who catch "Saturday Afternoon" will have a market event with the scenes between this scary, pudgy-faced baby man and his strict, gently dominating mama wife. When Harry tries to hide money under the blanket, but she catches him in the action and forces him to overpower it, you would swear to see an interaction between a 6 year old boy and his mother. . . And maybe that's why Harry Langdon gave some crawlers and still do. <br /> <br /> But he's a compelling screen shot, and he doesn't do as much as the way he does it. In the scene with the coins under the blanket, Harry finds for example. The coins by placing a foot for the other, carefully as a tightener, counting his steps until he finds the right place, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moves like no other. Whether he's making you laugh, he's fascinating, apparently in his own world. Where his movie's plot is about, Harry is curiously passive, and almost never drives the story forward. In the final of "Saturday Afternoon" when the big fist takes place, Harry's co-star Vernon Dent is in the weight of the action, but Harry is in a drowsiness for much of the time and wins a kind of battle full of two cars (sitting on one, but with the feet on the other) as they run through the streets. It is a memorable image, and as the writer Walter Kerr wrote, it perfectly encapsulates Langdon's screen persona: he is a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of hectic action, blinking sleepily while the world hurries past . It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who have often worked together, have a report in this movie suggesting that a blueprint, Laurel & Hardy, would follow when they came together a year later. Langdon's style was a likely influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and the star may not be for everyone, but the movie is well worth seeing and you may find that Langdon makes an impression that is hard to shake.
