Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. Different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the mix of turkey. it has mostly the same language but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can see reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and learn their thoughts on music. the film not only contains the music in Istanbul but life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. The surprising part is, although I live in Istanbul, I learned lots of things from this movie.
