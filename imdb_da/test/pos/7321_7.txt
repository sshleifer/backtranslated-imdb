Directed by the younger brother of great director Leo McCarey, this is a very good card from Three Stooges, nominated for an Oscar. Her stooges are doctors named Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine and Doctor Howard. They are not the clearest doctors, but they benefit from the doubt as long as they handle customs and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked this short. It's not one of their best, but some moments are fun. A joke repeated more than once works every time. The part where they have to operate the hospital's manager is fantastic. Saying more would ruin some of the jokes so you have to see it yourself. Just another nice card from the three stooges.
