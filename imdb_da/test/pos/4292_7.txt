An old man riding a bike down a village road when a car comes out of nothing, kills him dead and keeps driving. The rest of the movie is used to discover who hit him, why he was hit, and what the consequences of this murder would be on the rest of the village. Separate Lies are actually a very British movie. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a special British phenomenon, but the way everyone responds to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a "stiff-overlapping" attitude to tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive, and more inclined to drama. The man who really spices life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire William Bule, played by a delicious devilish Rupert Everett (most American audiences will forever remember him as Julia Roberts' gay friend who completely stole all scenes in My Best Friend's Wedding). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but he is an absolute blast on the screen. No, it's not that exciting with a movie title (Separate Lies? How did they end up with the lame and forgettable title? Don't they just have a marketing team? Do they just worry about getting people to watch this movie?) But besides the title is a heartbreaking drama of power for forgiveness.
