*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the setup and consistently laughed throughout the movie. The action was great, with my favorite part being Howard's (Kevin Kline) attempt to be a "male man". The fiance and the parents did a good job as a support coffin. Spoiler Warning: The act of his conservative family's acceptance and attempt to be polite was cordial and credible. My only problem with the end was that Howard was actually gay. The movie is created as a "be as you want", but the film actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is that he loves Barbra Streisand's film and enjoys dancing to music. His mannerisms and tastes seem to be gay, and it is only until it is pointed out to him that he understands. Instead of freeing Howard, it closes the pigeon. Oh, he likes to dance to music than he should be gay. His confession at marriage felt like a bend to society's desires. In the end, the film becomes a gay movie that was not the original course. It gets almost bland with the rest. I think the movie would have been better eventually if Howard were right. It would have been more threatening for the message.
