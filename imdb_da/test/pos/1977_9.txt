<br /> <br /> My favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and sound of reality. Probably the best achievement I've ever seen Jude Law games. Incredibly original with exciting character developments and a storyline that winds and turns so fast that it takes a few minutes after the movie fully understands its genius. Even more fun watching it again until the end changes the beginning.
