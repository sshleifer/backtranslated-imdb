There I was on vacation, when my host suggested that we take this B-film festival in Breda. I was resilient when I had not been on a movie theater, but I have to admit that I do not regret a second of this (especially with Stephen Malkmus's contribution). It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> The SEA OF DUST starts as a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student to help a doctor whose city is destroyed by a crazy plague (somehow involving exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fiance and is thrown by her father. As he travels, he finds a girl lying on the road, another pant, and takes her to the doctor. Gift, I thought. It all seemed pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything became crazy and it suddenly became a completely different movie. Tom Savini looks like Dracula, characters begin to travel to "the other side" of reality, and the dialogue is becoming increasingly humorous. <br /> <br /> And just as I thought it had stuck in a groove, the picture changed again, getting really dark and bizarre. I don't want to spoil it for the first time viewers, but there is a fantastic sequence of hollow people, lots of chat about religious abuse of religion and some over-the-top effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (if you haven't figured out the look of a B-movie festival), but it's worth the time for adventurous viewers. Great visual, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. The play is sometimes a bit, but I think it's the intention. <br /> <br /> Funny I had to go to Breda to see a US image resembling a British horror movie. You count on the one out ...
