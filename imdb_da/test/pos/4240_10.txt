This is a great movie for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay, I'm sure it's not as good as what Child's Play movie was, but it can be really fun and fun. Chucky's laughs are fun. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Now, not a doll, but two that mean the double effect, Jennifer Tilly played really well and certainly hit the best kill of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Child's Play movies, this would be a worthy movie on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's feature film before, it'll be a new start. Of course, you have no idea how Chucky came into his current state (because I'm not telling you), but you'll find out why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very entertaining movie.
