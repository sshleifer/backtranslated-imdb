I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but chacun a sun arthritis and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit he was sick of this movie and the reason I gave it 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas was just amazing. She was trustworthy and beautiful, even though he was made for half of the film as if she had been crying for several days. Could "Random Hearts" have been better? Sure, but it is very worth seeing as it is.
