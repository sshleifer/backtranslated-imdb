Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I disagree on a few things. Firstly, this movie is nothing like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like that. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had elements of surrealism, but I think the film's basic approach is not "surreal" in itself. Therefore, it is not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a strange Euro-work, with some scenes bearing the mark of "wierd" not surreal. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think Heuzenroeder's music is brilliant. They used whistling, the old sound of land and western records, and it was better than most Aussie movies, which usually made the filmmaker with a stupid Indy band that the company wants to push. <br /> <br /> As for the name of the movie - I don't know why it's called Modern Love, I hoped enough that David Bowie would be dressed in a suit and lipstick ... and I started showing my age.
