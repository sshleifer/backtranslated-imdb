I encountered this movie in an Australian hotel room at. My brother and I were channel surfing, and who can we see, but a young Russel Crowe. But not the phone throw Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was incredibly creative and hilarious. It is a cast of creepy teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a licking salesman, prostitute and an unusually sexy mother. If you're lucky enough to come across this movie, I'd highly recommend picking it up. I must say that this movie was incredibly entertaining and I thank the fine people in Australia who do it ...
