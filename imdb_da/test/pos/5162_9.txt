"How can we not be full of all the misery in the world?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A lovely aerial view of a larger city becomes fraudulent with the entry of a fleet of airblocks; an irat hairdresser who responds to a perceived racist slur, cuts a path through a businessman's bush hair; A man dreams of being drawn to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of his class school class because her husband called her a favor. These and about fifty other vignettes running the gamut from the direct depression to the wildly humorous to the gratifyingly uplifting population of Roy Andersson's You, Living, his first move since his critically acclaimed, commercially unsuccessful second-floor songs. <br /> <br /> You, alive, are filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as songs filled with black humor, surreal situations, and strange-looking characters. Although it is a little longer and less focused than his previous work, it is still constantly Andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile look and detailed attention. If there is a theme that links the sketches together, it is that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow's second day" so let's treat each other with kindness. Along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from Louisiana Brass Band, dinner guests at a party room standing on their chairs, singing a shaking song and a house that turns into a moving train. The emotions range from a judge's gloom who tries to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstatic dream of marrying a beautiful guitarist named Micke for a crowd of spectators. Although there is no continuous storyline, the theme of greed and desperation is seen in several sketches. having two bodily individuals and their little dog sitting on a park bench, the woman blames the fact that no one understands or loves her, but she gently ignores the man's comforting and soothing words. There is also a hefty mix of irony. Under what appears to be an executive luncheon, a man tells another on the phone that workers do not appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things it can buy, such as good wine. When he does not see, a man at an adjacent table lifts his wallet loosely from his jacket on the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, you have the living an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a cautionary story that looks at the clutter we humans have got us into, but suggests that there is still time to turn it around if we keep the warning to poet Goethe who opens the movie: "Please, please, you the living, in your nice heated bed before Lethes icy wave strikes your fleeting foot.
