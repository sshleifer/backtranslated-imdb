I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulo's role as Williams for the whole show was worthy of Emmy. It was scary how good he did. And to be so fast-paced and so random and as creative as Robin Williams really is .... WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos probably had to say 20 quick fire lines and make 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all of which sounds as much as ROBIN WILLIAMS makes these characters ..... yes, my friends are impressive. It's a thing to do a Robin Williams imitation in a few minutes. Its the other to make it a whole TV movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played with facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos who kept me in mind. So for that I give him a 10.
