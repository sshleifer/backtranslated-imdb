I watched this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. Compared to those made for Lifetime movies that I used to watch, it became a moment, but unclear favorite. <br /> <br /> I've seen it maybe twice since then. I think some parts are small cheesy, maybe the plot may use some more actions. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. The magic realism is on par with Amelie, and the heart of Wonder Wonders. Despite the special developments in my taste, I still find the subtle magic of this movie, the lovable characters and its simplicity enchanting.
