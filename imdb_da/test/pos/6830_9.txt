The movie was good. Really the only reason I saw it was Alan Rickman. As he didn't take out the southern accent, but he did pretty well with it. Know Emma Thompson did really well that she certainly took the southern accent. I like the whole character in my opinion, not one of them did badly, another thing I noticed. I've read all these comments and not a person has comments on the Alan 5-o'clock shadow. It made him look even better, and he had almost one throughout the film. I would give the movie a 9 out of 10. Another of my opinions is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. Still it was okay. Love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he sits down in his car and sees them in his mirror.
