Age of Steel follows up on the previous episode, Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects and lacked in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the doctor. In fact, his kind of boldness, to this author, bears the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his kind of subconscious somides (as when ticking off times when Mickey holds the button in Tardis) but brings his own secluded superiority to la McCoy's Doctor as he lets events gather around him. Some reviewers and fans whose pieces I have read seem a little horrified to have such a young actor portraying a person who must be over 1000 years old, but I disagree. Tennants Doctor actually puts "the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and this can be seen in his almost slick characterization as when he finally confronts Lumic / Cyber ​​controller in climax. His world-renowned, eye-rolling "anothermaniacherewegoain" kind of attitude is refreshing, especially after Eccleston's excellent pseudo-working class, bathing ** interpretation of the character, more actor than Tennant's fresh faced pseudo-doofus. Tennant's best moment may be at the end when he recovers Tardis with his large foggy Baker-esquire laugh when Tardis reboots. Here we begin to get a feel for this new doctor, a character that is slightly more than the average person's different personality facets is divided into 13 different people; some contradictory, some more sympathetic than others, but all form part of a whole. Aside, these two episodes were passable, but weak. The concept of reviving cyber-brain is very welcome, and they look great, but the plot involving a parallel ground where this action takes place does not seem to work properly. Probably here people's dependence on technology and their need to serve what the doctor points out is excellent, but it could easily have been placed on today's soil or so. Some other weaknesses, as others have pointed out, are the ease with which Doctor and Co. coming out of the tight places, namely. the death beam from the Tardis component, the seemingly endless range of Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to burn through the rope ladder at the end, she hardly saw who, so I had to explain that it was traditionally used as a plot unit to release the characters from situations where there is no other escape! Some of the actors, especially Mickey, really need their guilt and some of them support. Lumic was scary when he had to be, his voice shone at Cyberman-esquire. The result was terrible, while the volume of music often swims in the scene. Overall, I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining, although the other half was acceptable. Building what we knew was inevitable, playing well, but the decision was disappointing. For many, escape escapes, no development of supporting casting, and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is excellent, and Davies takes it in a good direction, but the dialogue (besides Doctor's) must be tightened up, as Mickey's farewell illustrates, which was pure ham.
