I watched the movie in its original theatrical release in Austin Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I don't know if it still exists.) Walked out all the way with speakers around the walls that were connected exactly to all six channels. At 15, I was blown away. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and movies at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember living at least three amazing scenes where the surround sound made a big impact. (Although please forgive me if time has twisted my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a journey of the camera through Catfish Row, alive with sites and sounds of daily activity. You saw each one first, eg. A blacksmith, when the camera passed them, their sound would continue to be heard past the left or right down the side of the theater. The second was a marching band that was first seen in the front, and it marched past the camera, splitting left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own path, it also changed in timbre as it played against you, side by side and then away from you. And if that wasn't enough, they also took into account the Doppler effect for each instrument as it passed. The third scene was near the end of the movie when Porgy left Catfish Row for New York to look for Bess. He and about half of the cast members walk past the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the march. The other half of the cast / chorus sing along with them and also wave and voice farewell to Porgy and their other friends. The friend's answer can then be heard from the sides and the back. <br /> <br /> Surround sound was used with amazing effects throughout the film. I think I remember a stone or something thrown from a pier and hear that land in the water behind me. Little things like it were clear to theater players lucky enough to have the six channels - things that would just seem common in theaters without it. <br /> <br /> I was in the theater for more shows. You could do that. And I went back several times before leaving town. I've never seen the movie again. It literally BEGS for publishing on DVD with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope somewhere has preserved it. Please Gershwin's family, allow it to be released before it is lost too well to other generations.
