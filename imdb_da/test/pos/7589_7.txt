Every Sunday is an eleven minute short topic with talents from two of its young youth contract players, a couple who will evolve into players of note in the future. It is interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin as they perform on a Sunday concert for Deanna's uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody knew how great both of these young ladies would be. I always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. L. B. always had tensions on culture, and it was the guy who had Jeanette MacDonald on his studio and later hired such lovely soprano voices as Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. Judy certainly had his glorious career at MGM, but she paid a great price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several Gothic horror monsters, preserved universal images. She was smart enough to get out on the top and make it stick. <br /> <br /> So in their salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
