The funniest performance was by Shalom Harlow, as Matt Dillons supermodel boyfriend. She was more interesting to me than all the leading players. This movie got it all wrong; Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, could not stand up to the ridiculous plot. I liked hearing "Macho Man" by Village People over the final credits. The rest of the movie could have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy.
