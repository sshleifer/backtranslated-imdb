First of all - I hardly ever see Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life, I see a Swedish movie at the cinema! That's why I think it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of excitement and humor is outstanding, and sometimes you don't even know whether to be scared or just laugh! The reason is about this man, a writer who wants to travel to Germany after World War II and help the Germans start again. On his way to Germany, he tries to help his friends on the train, which is a bad idea though. What a clumsy shake! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always gets in the way ... OUCH !!! But he still got his good mood. A positive guy. Robert Gustafsson has made some less good films in recent years or so, and it really is a relief. He's amazing in this movie. It's one of the best Swedish films ever, and Peter Dalle has done an excellent job! Congratulations!
