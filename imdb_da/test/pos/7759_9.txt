Good animation, great character design and a light hearted story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu fun to watch. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, I thought this anime was pretty good, but it was much better for another watch. <br /> <br /> This is because it's done in chronological order, and when you see it in the correct order, you notice connections that you didn't see before. (OR it may be that you see another meaning for some events you haven't noticed before). You may read the original novels (not manga) of Tanigawa Nagaru before / after seeing this. The anime is very good at visualizing every detail of the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but referenced. (Bamboo w / wishes attached shown in episode 14) Overall, this anime is actually very good once after brief analysis of the plot (reading the book is also improved). It's a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seems to take over.
