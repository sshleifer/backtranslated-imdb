I'm just looking at this movement recently on the Encore channel. What a great movie, a great cast too. Flatliners are very exciting and unpredictable. The film has a fantastic opening scene by the sea and then to a series of scenes that establish the issues of life after death, giving a very strong history of history. Therefore, Nelson was played by Kiefer Sutherland the first to go through the test to die and return to life. Then it becomes very dramatic by bringing back his wrong action from the past to life. Then all the above characters went through the same experience except Randy Steckle played by Olliver Plat. Then the story unfolds in a resolution and basic understanding of life and God's presence and meaning. David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon an atheist ends up questioning his own belief in God. It's great to see Julia Roberts with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Plat, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at such a prime time in their careers. One can ask how we come, not so great film produced anymore. This is one of the best productions by Joel Schumacher. I really enjoy this movie.
