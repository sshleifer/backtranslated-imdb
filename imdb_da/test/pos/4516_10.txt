I know that to include everything in the book, the movie would have been several hours long, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and crucial to the story. I thought the casting was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was amazing! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... scenes in Afghanistan were shot in China, and a scene that took place in Fremont, CA (the graduation scene) was actually shot at Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on "Kite Runner" and that was the day of the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80's, so we took our seats in the audience. They shot the scene over and over until they were happy about it. It was cool to see the actors close by and also to see the book's author who was present as a history consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story of friendship, love, guilt and possible redemption. "There is a way to be good again."
