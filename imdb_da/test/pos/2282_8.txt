An egoistic major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan, he contravenes a culture that is foreign to him, a seemingly humorous leader, an attractive Japanese woman, and his own professional and social uncertainties. There is some subtle charm that flows through Tom Selleck's performances. There is humor, sometimes softly discreet, as in this movie, sometimes slapstick as in "Folks!", But always there seems to be some higher purpose involved. Throw a person full of self-doubt, struggling to solve his personal difficulties while holding onto "doing the right thing" and you end up with a movie, both fun and thought-provoking. The shock fits together as a championship, and although none of the players or films win prizes for their efforts, they will make the viewers feel good (and perhaps it's the best results). You want to watch this movie more than once, and each time Mr. Baseball a homebase.
