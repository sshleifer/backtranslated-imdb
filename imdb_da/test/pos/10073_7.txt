So Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Yet this is one of her first films and a comedy about it. Give her a break! Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pale to its former counterpart w / Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though (a piece of fluff), it's pretty fun to see. I have yet to hear anyone who beats Madonna's acting skills back it up with evidence or even adjectives apart from "terrible", "bad" or other such vague descriptive words. If you want to see bad plays or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, what about Whitney Houston ?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't make her way out of a hatbox. Of course, the American public cannot distinguish the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. I think Madonna has always been least credible in her films. Get real people. Madonna bashing is then the 90s.
