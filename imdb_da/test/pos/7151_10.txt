I watched this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and I was also surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it wasn't just power and beautifully crafted, but very original. The audience was totally engaged, and the majority of watching a movie like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and set the Q&A session afterwards. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have gone much further. The film is thought-provoking and hilarious at the same time. It will be a shame if this movie is not downloaded for wider distribution - I hope it will at least be available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
