I'm a glutton for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In ticket like this movie. This movie, made for very little money, seems to do something that some major budgeted films fail. It's cheezy. It's gory. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. There are a few good effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stuck in the chin with a knife and the poker up through his tongue and snaps into the mouth of the mouth and an outbreak with a guy gets his eyeballs shaken out. But there are also lots of zombies, and some psycho-killing patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers keys as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead looks better, but it is still the pattern of the baptized blurry zombie films from the 70s and 80s, and it still has a high cheeze factor. Don't expect Romero, just the second rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it and it's fun and cheezy and a quick ride through B-movie Land.
