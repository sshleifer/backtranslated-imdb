Players: DR is not a fancy made movie, it is more like amateur video. Terrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, cloak, plate ..... okok ... everything. You need about 10 minutes to adjust your expectations on visual, so you get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers, none of my friends are playing RPG and I always want to be one of the characters in the D&D world. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what it would be like to be a gamer. You see rule books, dice, game sets, etc. Etc etc; You hear concepts like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "Chaotic Evil". <br /> <br /> Which RPG wants me, let's do everything you want, not bound by software RPG. Players: The DR gives the same element you don't know what's going to happen next, and it probably just makes you laugh at death. The film goes both gamers' real life as well as in the D&D world. You will hear the gamers throw the dice when the character in the game takes action, which makes you feel like you are really participating in the game. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything but in short, players: DR is a must see movie for RPG lovers. For people, never play RPG games, I'm sure you still get many fun from it.
