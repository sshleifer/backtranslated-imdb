I am glad that I read Sarah Waters novel first when I had my own pictures of the characters in my head at that time. However, those who were thrown to this production were not at all disappointing. In fact, after I got used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did an amazingly fine job in the casting department. (Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious?!) The BBC has done it again: This is a wonderful production of a very good book and they have done it in style. If you can get your hands on this (VHS, DVD), you need an 181-minute version (the week-round). It's a great journey, though a little rocky at times, that you won't regret taking.
