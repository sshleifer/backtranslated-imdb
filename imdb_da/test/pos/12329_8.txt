I have good memories of this movie ... I was only 12 when it was released and it scared the beesus out of me. I really miss my bejesus ... Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleum, how can you go wrong? It's like Phantasm's retarded cousin. <br /> <br /> This film was released one year before the PG-13 rating was introduced. <br /> <br /> I submit that One Dark Night is the GORIEST PG movie (not scariest, mind you) ever released. <br /> <br /> Can anyone come up with a gori choice? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I do not consider Poltergeist to be gurus ... scarves, yes, but not gorries ...)
