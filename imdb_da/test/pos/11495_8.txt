I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. I personally found her first film, 1996's Manny and Lo, to be a wonderfully detailed character study, and the performance was consistently wonderful (with particular credit to Mary Kay Place). The movie played for a week or two in major city centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many considered it easier. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and it also disappeared. And once again, critics rejected the film so easily and pushed the film aside, which promised at most Heather Graham's screen presence, but rarely her recording ability. And again, for me, Committed is a solid success. I think Krueger has a real voice and a personal visual style, and it is traits that should not be ignored so easily, simply because she works on a very reluctant canvas. <br /> <br /> The title has several meanings, but mostly it refers to Joline (Graham) refusing to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) flake out and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in the recent film history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And of course the plot is as simple and thus just as easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joline is a generation's crying voice whose parents divorced from a speed approaching fifty percent. And for me, her personal revolution against broken promises and a fraudulent heritage is pretty intelligent and powerful. Surely on the belief that people just don't have enough trust in each other, Joline must inevitably find that her beliefs aren't synchronized with society as a whole. More comments she has referred to her character as one-dimensional and I'm afraid it's a simplified reading of the movie. Or maybe even a misread. If Joline was just innocent, she wouldn't be interesting at all. It is the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play according to the "normals" rules that make her so interesting. Sociologically, she is a completely different. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls in moments with cutesy dialogue and her direction of this movie has a rather strange over-dependence on clouds of clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. But her mistakes are quite rare, and in this movie, as in Manny and Lo, it is the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because she has never had a character perfectly tailored to her as Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems comfortable playing an adult, even a slightly arrested development. She wears the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother) both have a number of fine moments, like Alfonso Arau, as a Mexican mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the somewhat psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their surroundings, well-detailed, completely organic creations. These signs can sometimes seem effortless, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist turned over by Jolin's affection, fits in strangely, even though his character's foreign objects are never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a movie that gets the depth to look back. Another commenter talked about the stereotypical Mexican portraits. And again, I'm tempted to call it a misread. Joline is looking for self-awareness. She knows her engagement is out of control, but she is looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make herself meaning. Arau's character understands that most people do not believe in him and he plays his own belief when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this movie could be seen as substandard, I would simply disagree. It is consistently fun, often fun and all the characters exude a warmth that is absolutely wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give this a 7.5 / 10 and when I log in to the vote here it will go up to an 8.
