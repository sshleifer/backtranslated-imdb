Let me start by saying that Liev has received a lot of respect from me after seeing her director debut "Everything is Illuminated". Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with indecent and fun vocabulary by Alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dream-like sequences. Liev took all this and made it work. The movie itself is amazing - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. There is a lot of history about the city and its inhabitants, but there is only so much you can do with an indie, so this part of it didn't disturb me too much. It's just disappointing that not many people will watch this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it. I didn't even know it was in theaters. I didn't know when the DVD came out. You would think that when Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, anyone would at least have released a commercial for it. I had to watch the trailer on my "Paradise Now" DVD (released on DVD in the spring of '06) to know for itself that it had a "Fall of 2005" theatrical release date. Haha - really sad. <br /> <br /> At least, if you stumble upon this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and recommends you see it - take my advice and see the. It is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
