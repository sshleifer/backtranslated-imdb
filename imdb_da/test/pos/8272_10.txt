I'm so happy I recorded this on VHS tape when it was presented at the Master Piece Theater. This is a movie I can see over and over again. Like living in the early 1800s in England, it is not hard enough, Prue is born with a "hare lip" and is excluded from birth. The people in her village accept something, but always fear she is "from the devil's forge" and are quick to turn her on. Especially when a lot of accidents go over her family. She is strong and brave, but pushes away from Kester Woodseaves, a travel tissue that catches the eye. Partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so virile that he must have a wife who is as lovely as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of time, and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. The movie stays true to the original story of Mary Webb and is runny from the beginning to the end.
