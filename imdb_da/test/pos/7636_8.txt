It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre I am looking for realism. What counts is that the characters are sympathetic and, as needed, sexy. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed, and Jake Weber is beautiful in an offman kind of way. They have enough chemistry to make the story credible in the area that counts, sexual attraction. I would love to see one of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is also sweet.
