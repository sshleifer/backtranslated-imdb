I have to be a little skeptical when I got into the cinema to see OSS117: French comedies tend to be so self-satisfied today that only the stupid scores are high at the national cash register. But I was surprised that even though humor does not always reach the level of Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French worldview in 1950, which OSS117 represents, are hilarious, and the director managed to recreate filmmaking at that time with an amazing fidelity. To put it briefly, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And at least for once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can come on many people's nerves) perfectly complies with the character he plays.
