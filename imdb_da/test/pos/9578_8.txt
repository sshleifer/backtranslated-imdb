I admit I have never seen "Waiting for Guffman", 1997's acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town, a play. When the Best in Show advertisement had the tagline "From the team that took you to wait for Guffman", quite a few critics out there suggest in their reviews that only people who are familiar with the movie or the filmmakers and caster would have a good time to watch this movie. For shame, critics, too shame twice! Any critic who has something like that with any movie will probably not share the riches of the movie with the rest of the world, but it's a movie I hope people will experience now that is video / DVD. "Best in Show" is undoubtedly the best comedy from 2000. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a mockumentary style that introduces the main competitors (not to mention screws) of the annual Mayflower "Best In Show" competition where dogs of all breeds will compete to see who is the best dog. We have the beloved and gracious Harry Pepper (Guest) with his blood dogs, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their major, nutcases yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), gay Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and the airheaded millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with his trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their thoughts on a single object: The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And ... should I tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> Director / author / star Guest's idea of ​​humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that idiocy of movies like "American Pie" or others meaningless "teen" flicks will not take over the world at all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not just fun but SMART fun. But instead of following in the glorious footsteps of movies like "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand, he also used this approach to "Guffman"). Whether you feel or not, a very large part of the movie is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do was probably not written in the script, perhaps not even dreamed of by Guest and co-author / star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest, he and the actors drew a hilarious theatrical feat that would probably have flopped if handled by other less talented actors. Now it's smart! <br /> <br /> Of course, cast is what makes improv work the most. Everyone is a (comic) marvel to see, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout should be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless announcer on the competition who can spin out the most outrageous funny stories and comments that no advertiser would ever dream of ... that is, if the advertiser tried to be fun . Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly continuing and about how much he can bench press. There is even a part where he gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: Has sexy women bags in tight shirts and shorts with dogs and indicates something that "has a dog shape for a time". It's invaluable, like his performance. I hope people get involved in this 90-minute "dogumentary". The film deserves so much recognition. It was nominated for Best Picture Comedy at the Golden Globes, but did not win. I can't see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it's best in show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
