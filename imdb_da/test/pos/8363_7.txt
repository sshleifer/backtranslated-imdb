Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. Hero High was supposed to be a new Archies cartoon with their superhero identities: Pureheart The Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation couldn't get the rights to do so, so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. Here is the breakdown of characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Samson (Mr Weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical lame filmation jokes, but at least it had a fun feel. It was entertaining enough for kids but not quite up to previous standards. The second segment was Shazam !, who was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. All the great villains created appearances, as well as the entire Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel, for at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct WC Field's voice and shady character, as well as his everlasting "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a veteran of 70's television shows, like Fish, said Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the early 6 Million Dollar Man episodes and Skeletor's voice in He-Man) handled Dr. Sivana. The Marvelers had always had a sense of whimsy for them, so little change was needed for their adventure to meet the requirements of Broadcast Standards and Practices. As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains that appeared were: Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his screen debut. <br /> <br /> Hero High is due to be released from BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo as well as the live-action show. Hopefully the proposed movie will help shake them loose on DVD. It is worth seeing and deserving of DVD processing.
