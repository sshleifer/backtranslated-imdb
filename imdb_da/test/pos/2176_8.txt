I think it's the first time I've seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a slaughter child. The way he moves is a lot of fun in my opinion, such as how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; His facial expressions really fit into the role he plays, for example, how he flashes to the audience in the end. But one might add that it was probably not too difficult. Anyway, I think he would have earned a longer career. As you probably know, it was destroyed by greedy journalists who made money by tapping false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal. The reason is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employed in a store and rivals for Almondine's love. After a heavy food struggle, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the shopkeeper. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fat and Alum enter the school in a row, and the battle for Almondine continues. (Some of the character's names are different in the version I have seen. It seems that for some reason they replace the original title cards with new ones.) There are many corny gags like food matches and chat, but they are well done In my opinion. And there are some gags I really liked, such as how they get the dog to run the pepper grinder (or is it a coffee grinder?) Or the stage when Fatty dons a coat, although of course it is not necessary, or when Miss Teachem, the head at the girls' school, Fatty struts, and he spends her back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also fun in this, his first movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer of the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pushes him from one room of school to another, he does not show a simple talk but lands on his hands and head and makes a little pirouette. Beware of a scene in the match: Alum throws a melpose on him, but it misses and hits the shop owner instead. It makes Buster laugh, which must be rare, as he usually always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably already know - got him the nickname 'The Great Stone Face'). (Another note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was "Fatty" Arbuckle's nephew, and later became famous for the "Fuzzy" role he played in many westerns.) <br /> <br /> I can not like this one as much as I like, such as 'One Week' and 'The Balloonatic' (film that Buster made later, without 'Fatty'). And that didn't make me laugh very often - but it made me smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
