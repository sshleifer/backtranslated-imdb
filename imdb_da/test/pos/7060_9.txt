This is easily the best of the summer camp movie. In fact, few of the others themselves are righteous, let alone how near as entertaining as this one is. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply out to have something good, clean and fun. Many people who went to summer camp as children will see that this is faithfully presented as usual, but with slapstick comedy mixed in. Bill Murray leads the tenant's top advisor, Tripper, a fine ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of the troubled nonsense. Tripper has big lines all the way through and usually sends his jokes as pseudo-announcements over the camp's public address system. <br /> <br /> Several big supporting actors played the campers and advisors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, constantly strewn among the many events in the camp hi-jinx. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two characters, especially well-done. The adventures (and misadventures) of these two are fun. Each has classic lines and they are characters you like and root for. Look for Spaz in the disco dance pandemonium. <br /> <br /> The girls in history are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervy, or any of the other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these characters credible. <br /> <br /> The necessary pranks abound, usually at the expense of campy's Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these pranks begins with disgrace and progress from there. However, Tripper and the others have their serious sides with all the sadness. For example, tripper befriends a shy, lonely child, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and takes him under his wing. The story culminates in a sports competition against a rival camp. It's a great "mess to the underdogs" final. Once the chips are down, Tripper is motivating "It's just as indifferent" spiel is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready to root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
