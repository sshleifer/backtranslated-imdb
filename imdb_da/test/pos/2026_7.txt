Rock Star is a "good" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who shouldn't be nice are really nice. Chris is a lovely guy who teaches a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, despite all the fineness. Maybe I'm just used to all the anxiety on the X Gen music. In some ways, the movie was a caricature of the Rock Stars and not hard enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's plays are pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> See it. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, watch it.
