H.O.T.S. is proof that at one point the film industry said "F-OFF" to the censors and made movies with what they wanted! In today's world, this movie will be too "over the top" and "extreme" for it to be anywhere but behind a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had multiple copies on their $ 5.99 rack (if anyone wanted a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, as the mixed humor into a T&A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin flicks, it had a plot. However, this is not exactly why you wanted to see H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a college movie reminding me of the revenge of the Nerds movie, taking a group of "average people" and setting them against the elite rich preppies that most people cannot stand! The only difference is that the "Nerds" in this movie have a much better shot at being laid! I notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low and for me it is ignorant! Obviously, this is not supposed to win Oscars or break barriers in film. If you are looking for it, see what ever critics choose for you! You must appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a fun plot, decent play (mostly given the genre), and lots of girls getting naked! H.O.T.S. is one of the movies you see to get your mind out of modern problems and daily stress, and instead, laugh and feel good! If you're looking for a fun college-based movie that has enough skin to beat a pink Miata, then you really need to check out the H.O.T.S.
