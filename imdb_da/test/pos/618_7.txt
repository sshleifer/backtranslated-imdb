The first half of the movie scared hell out of me, and I'm usually not easy to scare, but the other half of this thriller didn't work very well, but still very scary! A good thriller than using simple ways to make good horrors. Low budget, set in Russia, unknown cast, and made in Europe. But still fun, and yes there are also some laughs that throw in for good cases!
