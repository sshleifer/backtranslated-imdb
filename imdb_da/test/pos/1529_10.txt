Rarely does a movie record such intense drama and emotions. What makes this movie so disturbing is that the drama feels so right, it's hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's pursuit of their career. The film almost feels like a theater production as it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very hard to get a copy of it. I haven't seen anything but Laserdisc yet. This truly powerful movie deserves a digital remastered transfer and special edition DVD. It's really that good.
