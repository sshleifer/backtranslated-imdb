In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers On A Train", Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of ​​two killings. The rather pushy Anthony suggests he could murder Haines' unfaithful, wife and Haines could murder Anthony's dominant father. The lack of any connection between the killer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes remain unsolved. The tenor of conversation leaves the more Haines with the impression that the proposal is not quite serious. Complications occur later when Anthony kills Haines' wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargain. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are evident from the start. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and quite modest about his performance while Anthony's life goes nowhere and he admits to being thrown out of three high schools to drink and play. Haines is in relation to a senator's daughter whom he wants to marry. Anthony interprets this characteristically as a cynical maneuver on Haines' part to give a shortcut to a career. The grade differences are also enhanced visually. Anthony often inhabits shady areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from the more heroic perspective offered by low camera angles. There are some striking visual sequences like: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines' wife, shown through the reflection of her glasses falling to the ground as she struggles to rid herself of Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) the decoration of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small towards the huge white Jefferson Memorial building. <br /> <br /> (3) The occasion where all spectators at a tennis match hold their heads in harmony while a head (Anthony's) chillingly still stuck in a position that looks at Haines. <br /> <br /> The scene where the roundabout goes wild out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly. <br /> <br /> Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2p airs by feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train pulls out of the station, there are 2 sets of tracks that give a choice of 2 roads ahead. The 2 men discuss the murder of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. Hitchcock cameo sees him fighting on board the train carrying a double bass. Haines feels double crossed when his wife rejects a deal they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 lovers. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, he lights up his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in his glasses. Anthony later becomes very confused when he meets the senator's younger daughter, whom he sees as a double for Haines wife. Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to continue with the second murder. When Haines travels alone in a train that goes to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same wagon who accidentally kick their feet together the same way he and Anthony had. The action throughout the film goes on to a good pace and the performances by Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the senator's younger daughter) are extremely powerful.
