This is the hardest movie I have ever seen ... the emotional content is terrible, yet unforgettable. A woman accused of being a political activist is brought in to question. The whole film is about her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles that they deserve Oscars for their performances.
