I've been away from Istanbul for the last 10 years. During that time I lived all the time in London. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I am Istanbul. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm part of Turkey. One of my things is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. Faithfully believe Akin thought he made a great musical documentary, but I have to say it's more than that. It's about putting a nice mix of very different musicians, cultures, approaches, politics, ethics in a delicious jar. As we all know that Turkey is accurate, Istanbul has always come and goes between being eastern or western city. As one of the band member said Istanbul is a bi-cultural city. But much more an eastern city, because we always tried to be a western city. It shows that we have never been one. <br /> <br /> This movie will capture from the very first second. Music is excellent, people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's nice to see you all at a small movie theater in Wood Green.
