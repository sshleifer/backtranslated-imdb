People who know me say I have a weakness for animated movies. To be fair, these people are HALF right. My current weakness is for unusually well-liked animated movies, such as this vintage family girl from Max and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You can think of yourself, "Well, if it's so good, why haven't I heard about it?" Fair question. This film was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The inevitably bad timing caused the film to sink into relatively hazy. However, things look up because it has finally been released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". It's fun that the movie went through all this because it kind of reflects the plot itself. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I personally think that the movie's main page is endurance through adversity and hard times (after all, the country had hardly pulled out of the depression at that time). <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper hero, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered society. Problem: Every time he tries, whether he is out of evil or by simple disadvantage, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to despise the very people he tries to rescue. While doing his best to maintain a positive outlook, he occasionally breaks down, and it is only through encouragement and support from his friends that he returns to his feet and fights the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done, no one is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Okay," you say. "It has a good message (two actually). Does it really do very well?" <br /> <br /> My answer: Partly. <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this movie special. It's the characterization. This is one of those films where you can only see the personality of each cast member in their animation. You don't even need the spoken lines. A good way to sum it up is "energetic" or "lively". A lot of movies have used the sales argument, "lovable cast of characters". When I hear that line, I always get to think about this movie. <br /> <br /> Case in point, the bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smug the mosquito. Many movies have "lovable" villains, but I don't think you find anyone as entertaining or endearing as these communities. Forget the 3 Stooges Cartoon from the 60s. Swat and Smack are the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) that you will ever find. Almost all the funniest moments somehow involve this cruel twosome. Yes, they are rat no-goodniks, but you are still worried about them. It's the kind of power you only see from a truly talented writer, instructor and crew. <br /> <br /> The movie has two short jokes about racial stereotypes (Indians and Chinese). I do not think they should be malicious; but they are there, regardless. They did not disturb me, but it would be quite unfair for me not to warn anyone who would potentially be bothered by them. <br /> <br /> So if you share my weakness (and I think you do), give it a ride.
