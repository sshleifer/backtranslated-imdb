The Internet is a wonderful thing isn't it? I see a wallpaper episode of one of my all-time favorite documentaries, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War" from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I write a review about this series and have just read a new review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I just want to say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one-sided. I know America was the most important player in the West, but it takes two sides to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were great weapon providers in the north, why why Mr Nguyen does not mention them as partially blamed, showing an ignorance (I think we all know why he did not mention them, either ignorance of being raised in a communist system and its political dogma, or because he was afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested.) Also, Mr Nguyen, I guess that the northern parts are the biggest aggressor, the whole war was not shown in your country, so blaming America again for showing ignorance. Whether it is interesting to read a review from Vietnam (of course it can also be done, but I take it so right), at least the communist east is something open. As for the mini series; Why do I love it? It does not focus solely on the American commitment. This was a war that started 15 years before America became involved, and the series covers every aspect of history, so it's a real plus. The recordings used are first rate, all the Vietnam war programs you see made now use the same footage, so you don't miss out on seeing this older series. The date this series was made is another plus. It has all the big players interviewed that you cannot do now because they are dead from old age, it is an important historical reference. Third, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounding like James Earl Jones voice would and I think it is very steep praise. I don't think you can find a better war documentary ever made, it's like taking the relatively modern technology from 1980 and transplanting it to 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of World War Two, it does for the Vietnam War. OK, I see a bit of bias, its subtle, a 70's-80s style, subtle bias, like the NPR "All Things Considered" bias where it all seems so straight forward, but when you blink you end up shaking your head. In this case, the later episodes do not show much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, do you NOT think ???? <br /> <br /> From an OIF War Veteran, the same goes 30 years later.
