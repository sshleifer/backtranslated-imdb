This groundbreaking film is really a work of art. I went into the screening at the convention in Indiana with very low expectations, having already seen 2 other movies with "gamer" in the title (both were so bad that at the end of the other I had picked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits, "Dorkness" had me. The temperate northwestern setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama around the frustrated game master, the Lodge (heavily portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his misfit band of friends who devoted the real dramas they meet every day to meeting amazing dramas in the surroundings Lodge mourns for them. After the first scene (set in the fantasy world, the resident), they are being violently withdrawn in the world, so desperately trying to escape. This created so many comparisons with my own life that I was moved to tears. The giant's play is such an amazing caliber that I really believed within the first 20 minutes of the movie that he really was a twenty-something man suffering from frustration, male baldness and an annoying group of "friends" who can't think Understanding concepts as right and wrong. Lodge's friends are here in some places: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, except the lodge. Still, he seems to be socializing with Gary, the youngest of the group. This only seems a little strange first until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy does not serve to confuse, but to inform and uplift the public about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors depicting Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to play the signs of laughing at times as if they were informed that they were performing in a comedy in instead of a hard frame action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's motley crew. The excitement is always high when he is on the screen, both when he argues passionately about his belief in the Lodge or when he shows his amazing martial arts as "Silence" his fantasy character. Or even when he suddenly turns to face the audience, and you reflexively use the audience not to be tasted by his amazing chin. Lewis Lights up the screen whatever he does, and I hope to see more of him in the future. When the action begins in this movie, it just doesn't stop. The drama and action mix so seamlessly at times that you can tell about your midst of a frenetic action sequence or a moving dramatic moment. Really an exciting tour of epic proportions, I would recommend "The Players: Dorkness Rising" as required viewing for anyone who loves movies. It was almost worth losing sight. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
