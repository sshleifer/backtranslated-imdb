This second pairing of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is a great as the first. Predictably maybe, but I don't care and still laugh a lot when I see it. Wile E./Road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart. So knowing that the second slice in the golden collection would not only contain 11 of this, but they would be in chronological order (2 to 12, the first episode was on Volume 1), made me get misty eyed. I love these things. This animated card can be seen on Disc 2 in Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also features an optional comment from Micheal Barrier. My character: A +
