CACTUS FLOWER was a lovely 1969 comedy based on a Neil Simon game about a dentist (Walter Matthau) who had an affair with a young free spirited woman (Goldie Hawn), totally unaware that his devoted nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman ) is in love with Hello M. Matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep, and he does not disappoint as the philandering dentist, dr. Julian Winston, who is dating a woman, but really has no idea that he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her sparkling performance as Toni Simmons, the aging infant who slowly realizes she is trapped in a dead end and not as weak as she looks on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this movie was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, Dr. Winston's devoted assistant who is willing to bury and sacrifice his own happiness as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is shining in this movie and looks absolutely beautiful (even though the camera has always loved her) and shows an unexpected knack for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and settings are a bit dated, but the story is timeless, and the star's performance almost makes it possible to see.
