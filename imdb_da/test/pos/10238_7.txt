What is fun about Barker's Nightbreed is that it is the story of a man on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this one, the monsters (the title name) are the "good" guys. It shares his feeling of celebrating the different, the twisted and the dark with the first Addams Family movie, and much of Tim Burton's work. It also has the goriness expected of a piece of Barker. Particularly fun is Cronenberg's performance as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying Nightbreed. As it happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monster's castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with weapons and bombs. And this time, the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burning in the windmill felt the very center of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting and surely more cooling work. But it is pure fun, it looks good and stays light without fooling itself. Worth to see!
