I watched this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has the moment I think you would say. Some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic. I will not put this movie in my DVD collection but it is reasonable enough to recommend for rent. I suppose nothing puts the film on another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the action is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
