If this film is carefully examined, it is a little sad. It is detailed enough to affect very real problems children grow up in poor, dysfunctional environments. Nevertheless, it retains its comical value, with exciting performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in her mother's struggle and dysfunction (Carroll), which can't really help her children, not because she doesn't want to or tries, but because it's obvious she doesn't know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen this, or if you have, watch this movie and see humanity in the characters. Good movie.
