Considered by many to be oddly overlooked Chabrol, it seems to me the reason it has been cold shoulder is its sleaze factor. Not so blatantly sexy, violent or gruesome as many movies during this period, it still begins to be quite frightening, and even though it gets more measured, it continues to trigger a rather unpleasant odor. Mrs. Audran, not here the ice maid, but a drunk mother, Donald Pleasence makes a comedy as a childhood motherhood, David Hemmings has eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother, a sister and a niece. No, it's not that fun at all, and Chabrol treats everything as if it's very normal (as it may be in a small little French village!) Instead of Ed McBain's New York City. Had this been treated more sensationally, it would have been a more acceptable but smaller film. Here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant opportunities before the final degradation. Very visible
