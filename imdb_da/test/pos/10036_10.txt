Now it's more like that! One of the best movies I've ever seen! Despite it being very good on all aspects, this movie was put down solely for not being historically accurate. Solve yourself! There are plenty of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being historically accurate, and many of them don't even come close to how great, entertaining and captivating this movie was! Now this is where a movie is about! You get exactly what you want from this movie's genre and all the naysayers are the ones with the anti-Flynn syndrome. This conservative rat syndrome is very closely linked to anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton, anti-Kennedy syndromes, which are usually due to fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs. If the viewer of this movie is open-minded and has the ability to separate politics from art, you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best films from all the time. I rate it the second best western ever, right b behind Wayne's Cowboys ........
