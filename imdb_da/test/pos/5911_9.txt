Stewart's age did not disturb me at all in this movie, even though he portrayed a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story, and while I was thoroughly grown up at the time this biopic was made, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does this have a great achievement by Stewart, it also provides many fascinating technical data, making it understandable to those technically challenged like myself. And the appearance of the aircraft itself was fantastic. I absolutely loved this depiction of a period before my birth and the revival of childhood love I had for aircraft and for the idea of ​​air travel.
