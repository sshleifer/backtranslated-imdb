Certainly this turns out without a doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she is being promoted to: An ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly her finest moment on Acting, and she certainly deserves the credit for her work. Never in any of her other films, with the possible exception of Holy Marriage, has she been completely credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A young woman finds herself in southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into the political destruction of the landscape. She testifies to mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to watch, or you haven't seen all of Hollywood's finest. I rank it 58 in the 100 best movies all the time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bob
