The title comes from a change, a youth prison in a corrective facility makes the front cover of his schoolbook on the government titled "USA"; he adds "of (his name)." <br /> <br /> Many characterizations in this movie work well - the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and father Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and Sister Julie ( Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this movie - the angle on which everything depends - is Leland's character and motives. He is a little shy, passive, handsome high school student who boldly introduces himself to Becky who (we find) goes to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who just goes to high school and prepares to go to college; Julie's boys, Julie's age (and whose parents have recently died) also live with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous author. Leland is very understanding. The young boy in "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and acknowledges that years later they will divorce that pain will follow many people's present experience of happiness. BUT, of explanations that never become explicit, his prescient gift seems to work sometimes, for some people, some relationships, and not for others. ??? <br /> <br /> Parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt loan from "American Beauty", "The Sixth Sense", "The Graduate" and possibly some others I didn't recognize. It would not be bad if only Leland's character worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did a good job of playing Leland, but the manuscript and story imposed limitations. Would such an observant, meditative young man ever be homicidal? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the movie gives a reason for this. I am a retired therapist with extensive experience working with families and teenagers; while many of the reactions shown in the film work - this part is definitely the most crucial element. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element which, in my experience, would not coincide with true life even though it is not so critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters Becky and Julie has never been suggested, but it is okay. When two sibs begin to record different roles (one the whole good girl, the other the restless), the roles themselves can start to drive each other to more extreme positions. For the uneasy, Becky, is that kind of, "what should I do to be loved in here - give up being me and become Julie?" And the pressure to live up to being All-Good, the parent's pleasant child, is no less intense on Julie. So why should she break up with her guy's long friend and by whom the parents apparently approve? Don Cheadle was good as Leland's teacher; everyone else was good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was lacking was the decisive fall in understanding human nature. Good acting; flawed history and psychology; worth seeing; not a total loss.
