Bob Cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock movie doesn't really become famous as some of his other films, but is very visible even today. Priscilla Lane proves in this that she can keep herself with other lads working with Hitchcock later. She has just made a handful of movies after this, which makes her almost forgotten today. There are sequences in this that are reminiscent of the viewer of set ups in later films by the director. The storyline is so well done, and the story is so well done that this movie is still very entertaining today. Every person in the cast works well. There are several beautiful backgrounds in the black and white film. <br /> <br /> This was the first film at Universal for Hitchcock. Long races between the feature films he made at Universal, plus the TV series, Hitchcock would make so much box office for studios as anyone working there. This fact is lost in film history. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is well-cast as the real bad guy in this movie. The story moves really well, including Hitchcock's only filmed western order. This movie is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved.
