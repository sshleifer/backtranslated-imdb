It comes as no surprise that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who would later lead the most demanding war movie ever made, 'Come and See (1985).' 'The Ascension (1977)' ?? Shepikto's last finished movie before an early death ?? is built in very much the same mold. Seen during World War II, the film follows a couple of Soviet partisans trying to secure food for their starving army while avoiding the occupied German forces. The first forty minutes are agonizingly tense as the two men pull themselves on the hard, snow-covered landscape, the world around them completely killed by life, warmth and color (yes monotonous fighting is the landscape that it literally took me with it here long to realize that the film was shot in black and white). After the partisans prisoner of German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme coercion, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Is he wrong to do that? Ryback's betrayal is disappointing, but the film does not immediately condemn his actions as treacherous; instead, the viewer is forced to consider what their own answer might be in such a situation. Shepitko sings Ryback when the Bible sings Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to see them executed. But while Judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to Matthew's gospel), Ryback even finds this option closed to him ?? in an eerily tight climax, the belt around the neck is loosened. <br /> <br /> The Ascent draws its emotional power from Shepitko's astounding pursuit of realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors spent days eventually climbing over the snow-covered soil on their hands and knees, and in fact so convincing is their misery that I actually developed a cold while I watched the movie (seriously I did it ). Interestingly, the film records this reality on several occasions, as Ryback imagines himself making a bid for freedom and then being shot by his German captors. This unity, though unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Ryback faces a trial of his dignity and faces a new dilemma at every turn, he consistently chooses the selfish alternative, his own life the only decisive criteria. At the end of the film, he still lives, but the nightmare of war and guilt continues.
