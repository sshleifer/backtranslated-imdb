Oddly enough, the independent movie channel showed this movie a week after it showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - although the bear film was the second in the trilogy, and this movie was the first !!! What were they thinking? While all three of these films are supposedly based on this amazing Kyokushin Karate Master's life, you can't help but think they should have adorned the story a little - especially in this first movie. Sure the guy apparently beat and killed a bull and later a bear (in fact he fought and killed many bulls during his career), but in this movie set in the early 50s at the end of The movie, the hero was actually fighting about 60 guys and killing many of them brutally. I just can't imagine that this really happened. So I made some checks and found out that while many of the details are correct, part of this movie is pure bunk! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and yes he followed the widow and her son and spent a year working for them - trying to get them to forgive him. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but hogwash. By seeing one of his opponents get a staff sticking through his head and all the other gory details could not have happened, otherwise the Japanese government would have locked Oyama to protect the community! The movie is entertaining and the fighting is excellent. There are no complaints about the action or action. The only minor complaint is the camera work - which is a bit sloppy during some of the combat scenes. Despite this minor complaint, this is a finest movie. In many ways, the wandering karate master theme is hardly reminiscent of the Zatoichi films - which is also very fun to watch, but many of the exploits are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an English dubbed version of this movie titled "Champion of Death" and I saw it as well. It's not a bad dubbing, and it was letter boxed (a big plus), but I still prefer the subtitle version.
