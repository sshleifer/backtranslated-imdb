I saw this on television several years ago than I remember, but never forgot Sammy Davis, Jr.'s performance. I was just thinking of a chance to look for it on video. This reproduction of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see it again and introduce my son to it too. I just can't imagine why it's not named as one of the greatest performances by Sammy Davis, Jr., each. Anyone responsible for not bringing this to the public must be ashamed of his / her ignorance. I will continue to look for it though. Perhaps the execs responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of so many African American actors.
