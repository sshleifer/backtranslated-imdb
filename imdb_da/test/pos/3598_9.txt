Forget all the people who tell you, it's not as good as the book. So what? It's a movie. It is a pure joy to see, all the way out on the spot in Cephallonia, fantastic photography, but also with dark, disturbing moments. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. Apart from that, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
