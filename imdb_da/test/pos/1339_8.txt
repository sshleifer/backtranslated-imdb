It is a hard movie to go through as several factors need to be considered. Let's filter the more judgmental. Also, are you interested in facts about the serial killer by Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you resist an independent low-budget movie? Are you objective enough to NOT like a movie solely because of its lack of stars or professional appearance? Well, if you said yes, then you should have an open mind enough to handle this. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography. It is not a glamorized, unrealistic account, which unfortunately was the theater film "Dahmer" (2001). The movie begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, who was in the police car when they raided his apartment. His thoughts on what became him there are presented to us in a historically narrated style that precisely explains much of Dahmer's psychoses and motives that led him to commit murder nearly 20 times. We learn to know the character, both the incredible side and the side that came moderately close to living a normal life. It's not a fault, but Dahmer is that 17 people died, but as a criminal psychology student, I was happy more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this movie. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship, but of course we are witnessing the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual violence on the screen, how much of it is suggestive in shots such as blood spray or a body that is struck through a blurred curtain. You can see two deaths that I remember, one is a rather bloodless throat slash, and the other is a man who pushes alive into an acid water. While you don't see anything graphic, this cruelty and convincing play by both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. And while the actual screen's mutilation is kept low, you'll see the results. There is a prop hand and head or two, but it looks like it was disturbing the viewer and doesn't seem to be exploiting. Moreover, these false anatomical pieces are where the budget constraints are visible. Though acceptable, they probably look like fakes so as not to be too disturbing. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, because it was released a year or two earlier. It's about the only big difference from the real story, and the information left is, as I have said, very true to facts. Movie quality can be better, the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet, and several characters are a little hammy, but it's not overboard. In my opinion, this is a flawless but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most remembered serial killers. I think it's safe to say that the film is also memorable, and I respect it to overcome its limitations on providing the story in a credible way, backed by a thoroughly outstanding Carl Crew like Dahmer.
