My impression, after seeing this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before making the film. <br /> <br /> He took five years to do it, a work of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil in the editing process, what to leave, what to do. <br /> <br /> His father, the famous architect Louis Kahn, comes across as a man too selfish and self-centered to be emotionally accessible to even a wife not only three. But, like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by distances and entranced by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of his mistresses said he was "available," but it is never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A shame. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half-siblings in the space of a home Louis design is also tangible. The invisible hovering over the conversation. The only traces left by his father were in the buildings he left behind, some big, some not so big. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Saddened by the baby's mothers, who were caught forever by her poor impregnations, was never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother when she was told about her pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /> <br /> It seems, in this case, at least that the son is not the man of the man.
