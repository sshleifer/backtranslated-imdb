Frankly, I just enjoy seeing James Caan. Wonderful actress. With such simplicity, you know exactly what he is thinking. A true pro. <br /> <br /> I've seen the show from the beginning and found it different - it's something unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show - <br /> <br /> I also find the show fun and exciting - I like pacing - you never get bored - I especially like the mystery of each episode - the way it unfolds. I am a great mystery fan and have read many of the great mysteries, but I find the stories in the show well written and the result is rarely obvious. Also very interesting to me, probably because I am not a gambler, are the various disadvantages that the 'gamblers' come up with - I was fascinated by the number of arrangements people have made to rob Las Vegas. The music: I like the music at the top of the show. Perfect for the show ... Sets the tone and atmosphere. Just fantastic. And of course there is James Caan.
