Bedrooms and Hallways were one of the funniest films from the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the United Kingdom, it is about a young group of flatmates and their different proportions. Much of the humor is centered around a new-agey men's self-help group, where they pass around various tools such as "the rock of truth". They also go on a hunter-gathering weekend with hilarious results. Believe me you will laugh your teeth out.
