Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny, a woman who gives herself to help them in need. It is told from a boy's point of view, taken by Nanny when his own mother is not up to the task. I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It touches but not juicy. It is told in a very real way, without much of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling baggage. And the end is pretty good (teary but not over-the-top). Although it is clearly an African-American film set in the post-segregated black community of Lackawanna, New York, it does not carry its ethnicity on its sleeve. The story stands on the strength of the characters and dramas (and comedies) around their lives. It's not preachy, it's simply good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a fantastic soundtrack (can't beat old-school R&B and Chicago blues). In general, the play is strong, but not universally so. Some of the performances simply do not hold up to the characters that the actors must imagine. But considering it was a TV movie that can be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Incomplete but equally good movie for a rainy day.
