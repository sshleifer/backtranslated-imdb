This movie is really worth watching - Robin Tunney excels and Henry Thomas shows that he is one of the rarer, child actors who grow up to become a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth they could have been convincing - but all the actors are simply amazing. The shock of this movie must be ranked up there with "Girl, Interrupted" (both films randomly staring at the glorious Clea Duvall). The scores and music selections fit perfectly, and there are plenty of actions to prevent the movie from becoming a character study. If you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but I'd say the climax will haunt you for a long time.
