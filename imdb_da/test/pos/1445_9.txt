Otto Preminger was one of the major maverick movie directors. Like John Huston, he was a character from one of his own films, just like Huston he was a wonderful ham that hit in and out of achievement randomly, but the final product of his work was unmistakably his own. With a few exceptions, movies have now been made by companies, not individuals, and as a result there are usually highly polished "packages", a product in the same way as a golf ball, a can of dog food or a car is a product. The inclusion of people in the process is almost random. So, the appetite for the product is that there is no end to the line of well-finished, smooth, superficially entertaining, but ultimately empty films that flood the innumerable TV channels and movie outlets. There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to stand a little apart from the "product" stream and make a personal work of art. Of course, there has always been "art for the sake of art - money for the sake of Christ" ethos in film making, but now "Ars Gratia Artis" in all but name has been sent to history's cut floor. Today, Otto Preminger wanted to get a job delivering pizzas in Hollywood. Half a century ago, he has made the enormously influential, "Laura", "Where the pavement ends" and "The moon is blue", he set out to film Nelson Algrin's controversial novel "The Man with the Golden Arm" in his eccentric and individualistic way . Instead of taking his camera out onto the streets, he remained in the studio and used stylized almost expressionist sets, quirky casting (Frank Sinatra - hello from his success in "from here to eternity," the young, inexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Arnold Stang, a man whose qualities were after his own heart) and a remarkable era - defines the score of Elmer Bernstein with the cream of the west coast jazz. An Otto Preminger movie was always a versatile experience that had to be considered as a whole rather than breaking it into acting, controlling, photography. What was on the screen was Premingser's vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algrin's novel, not a movie by Algren's novel, one of the twenty competent Hollywood hacks coud has produced it. From the first hi-hat cymbal rhythm accompanying Saul Bass's iconic title sequence, we are drawn into Premingsers assuming what is today called "Life", truly a skimmed area occupied by hustlers, junkies, police, drug dealers , jazz musicians, their women and hangers-on. The lines are blurred in "The Life", and the dog eats dog down there. The inhabitants circle each other as sharks and look for a sign of weakness to be exploited. Frank Machine (Sinatra) a professional card dealer, ex-junkie and hopeful jazz drummer is a born victim. When it gets hard, he goes back to Even if he kicks the habit of going for cold turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that he will not go straight back on it anymore. Sinatra's depiction of an abuser in the withdrawal has split the critics, but the case is that even fifty years later, most of us have probably never seen such a thing in reality, so we do not know exactly what depiction is. When I first watched the movie in the late 50's, I was very impressed and watched it recently on video, it seemed to say it scary, hammy. Perhaps he is the victim of his own success, so many actors subsequently "do" Cold Turkey has, with this year's transition, taken its performance and refined it somewhat. Arnold Stang is excellent as Maskins Pal Sparrow, a performance he only exceeded in "It's a sour, crazy, crazy, crazy world". Try to see it on the big screen and see it as the cinematic vision of a true author, a giant among today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
