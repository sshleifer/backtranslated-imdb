Just watched this movie and it's not bad; There are a few exciting moments and not many long dialogue strings. Leaving as quite intelligent; Fast-paced almost like 'documentary style'. This movie will evoke some nostalgia and some cold war paranoia with cars, street scenes and 50's life. The action is pretty solid and in 85 minutes driving time it goes at a good pace. An atomic era movie buff should not miss this one.
