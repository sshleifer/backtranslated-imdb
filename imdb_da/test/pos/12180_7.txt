In the Queen's Queen, Akasha (Aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger and more demanding presence, she just got the eye and attention. now the film had errors, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past. What I also didn't like was the one the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was / was like. Akasha's (Aaliyah's) role was kind of limited in the movie and she did not appear until the other half of the movie and then on top of that, her (Akasha's) death came 2 quickly. But I liked how Akasha fought back when the old men tried to kill her, because in the book was the last fight between Akasha and The Old was a bit boring (they killed Akasha in as 2 seconds). Akasha's head was turned off for 1 sec and Lestat became the world's largest punk. <br /> <br /> Aaliyah played Akasha very well, and Stuart was perfect as Lestat they could not have chosen a better Akasha or Lestat. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
