This is a movie that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this movie makes any real world feeling or has any real world logic. It works completely in its own small world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hatred for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere on the Very Beginning I purchased into the completely unreal condition for hit woman who regains her memory as the past comes back to haunt her. There was a moment early where I remember accepting that this should be one of those films where the heroine would not know anything before it was necessary, despite all logic that it would not happen that way. "Oh, that's one of those movies," I said to myself, and was connected when the movie went on a wild two-hour hunt. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with brains and brawns that things follow, are their own internal logic, and you should actually pay attention to following some of the terms. I like this very much and pleasantly surprised when I come across people who feel the same. People either love it or hate it if they have ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, it's a movie that must surely try. You may not like it, but it is definitely worth trying out <br /> <br /> And as always, leave the reality at the door.
