My opinions do not extend to the majority in most cases. I tend to lean against artistic, imaginative and diverse. This film is reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion", where a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent being, which is not readily available to see the performance at its height, except on these masses of documentaries ala natural. Unlike these natural films, this offer utilizes the best filmmaking methods that industry needs to offer to fit a diva that creates one of the most sensual superstars (cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy portrays love relationships that evolve between a French soldier (he is also very handsome) lost on the Egyptian desert and a female leopard meets him as he chances for an abandoned Egyptian temple to be fascinating. I bought it wholeheartedly. If at least you are open to imagination and appreciate grace, beauty, power and sensuality, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my book was the end. It was a perfect set for a Romeo and Juliet finale - it would have taken me over the top. <br /> <br />
