It's the best movie I've seen this year! Excellent details and history (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It presents to you a "what if" situation where the island of Japan could be wiped out by this earth. A thought-provoking, life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth (good in this particular Japan). It also presents a great and ingenious solution to this massive tragedy. <br /> <br /> Terror, action, excitement, sci fi, documentary, love story, and all the human interest story you can get are all here! But I also warn you that it is a real tower chopper! The players, the actors and everyone are all excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... it can really happen anywhere on earth! Now let me ask you after you've seen it ... "What would you do if you were facing this life and death situation?"
