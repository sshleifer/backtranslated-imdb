Is it a murder mystery? Is it a political procedural? Is it a back-stage look at seedy French music halls? Quai des Orfevres are all these, but more than anything else, it is an entertaining comedy of adultery, jealousy and love set in post-WWII Paris. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of such nasty films as Le Corbeau or such exciting nails as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this. Clouzot, however, was a sharp film maker. "In a murder mystery," he tells us, "there is an element of playfulness. It's never quite realistic. Here I share Hitchcock's view that says: 'A killer is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself this, you might as well film a documentary. ' "Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful movie and it is no documentary. Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer at music halls and sacrament clubs. She is a flirt; Her contract name is Jenny Latour, and she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martin is a sad bag, he is her accompanist and organizer, a little bald, a bit lumpy and jealous for a mistakes, so we have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant). She is blonde, beautiful (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable. She and Martineau have been friends since they were kids together. Dora is certainly not just thinking on friendship when she looks at Jenny, then comes George's Brignon (Charles Dullin), a wizened, rich and dirty old man who often has Dora take "art" photographs of his young female prostitutes as he forms himself. offers a contract for a movie to Jen new, and suggest a dinner in his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny shouts right back to him: "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their dough. I'm all for royalty!" "You're a father was a worker," shouts Maurice back. "So what? Under Louis XV I would have been Madame de Pompadour! I had heated their tights!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon is found dead with a crushed champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull, Dora is trying to do things safely for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with tender feet. He's seen it all. He served in the "colonies" with the foreign legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine dopes on him. One of the first things Antoine discovers has not only helped Brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? Before long, Jenny, Maurice and Dora make alibis, lie and at some point confess. How will Antoine discover the killer? Will we have the opportunity to see some good music singing by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with time and detective Antoine's persistence. We are back with many kinds of love that lead to all sorts of motives, from hair-triggering jealousy to long-sighted people ... and all played with a blend of gallic entertainment. <br /> <br /> Clouzot leads us to a Paris in seedy but not threatening neighborhoods, to dimmed music publishers where tunes are played on the piano for buyers, to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We can see Jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in the living room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film actually takes place in this environment. With Jenny singing about "Her little tra la la, her sweet tra-la-la" we follow her from trying the song at the publishers to an exercise to a crazy performance with Jenny in a spring cap, a cross, tights and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant all do great jobs, but the Louis Jouvet keeps everything together. He was a wonderful actor who did not like to make movies. The scene was his world, and he only took movies if he happened to like the director and make money to fund his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and wide cheekbones. He was not conventionally beautiful, but he had what it takes to dominate a scene. For a look at how skillfully he could play comedy, see him in Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. At one point he says, "I've had a taste for you, Miss Dora Monnier." "Me?" she asks. "Yes. Because you and I are two of a kind. When it comes to women, we never get the chance." Jouvet brings all sorts of shades to the line, from rueful regret to a gentle pleasure.
