The summary is only for those who hate this movie as you find the movie OK or the average is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb has made me nostalgic, as I can't help going back in 1994. I was one of the few lucky ones to see this movie in theaters. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies and took a few years to make it my favorite. How can I say what made this movie my favorite? Was it the excellent writing (the story was OK, but manuscripts and dialogues were amazing) Was it superlative performances? Was that the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it should be a mix. It's one of the movies that has no flaws, not even its music. (The other movie comes up in my mind right now is Sholay) PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please please balance your drama and comedy movie. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeee ..........
