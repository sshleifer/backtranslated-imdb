This is the best 3-D experience Disney has on their theme parks. This is definitely better than their original 1960s acid-turn movie that was in its place, leagues are better than "Honey In Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), barely the MuppetVision 3-D movie at Disney -MGM and can even beat the original 3-D "Movie Experience" Captain EO. This movie revives some of Disney's greatest musical hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and others, and brought a smile to my face throughout the show. This is also a completely kid-friendly movie, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
