Although Dr. Seuess should have been credited with stealing the story "Horton Hatches The Egg", it was a fine movie. It affected both emotions and intellect. Because of the incredible performance of the seven-year-old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each difficulty), the thought-provoking elements think long after the tears move. Overall, superior trades from a solid cast, excellent management and a very powerful script. The right humorous features always help to keep a "heavy" issue from becoming boring or difficult to get through. Finally, this film stands the time test and in no way seems dated, decades after it was released.
