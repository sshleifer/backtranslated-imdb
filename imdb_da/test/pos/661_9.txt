Cheezy? Yep. Badly filmed? You betcha. Nulbudget? They claim it proudly on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure. <br /> <br /> This film celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teenage horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fit into a stereotypical scroll, they never escape a moment ; teens trying to survive a slaying of some mysterious force they are disturbed by doing something lamely youth; complete free nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of the victims; slow moving zombies big one-liners ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie, but more a tribute movie to the lost innocence of the 80's horror movies ... when it gets scared and widespread, it can also be fun, silly, sexy and greasy good time!
