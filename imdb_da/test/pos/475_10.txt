I find it hard to put into words how wonderful it was. Sometimes you see a movie that just sticks with you. "You are alone" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I play the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions again, as if I see it for the first time. There's nothing I didn't like about the movie. Fantastic soundtrack !!! The finish was perfect. Very emotional stirring !!! It was convincing and quirky. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever seen. I admired Brittany's strength (which strong woman). <br /> <br /> The tagline is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says I would never do that when we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of something and this film is shared directly into that subject. Honesty in the movie can be my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art !!!!
