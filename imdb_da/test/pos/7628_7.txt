Stupidly beautiful. This movie designates 'so bad it's good' genre of movie. <br /> <br /> The only two talents in it are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's a little boring that the man who rose to fame like Paladin should open up in this ugly pile of celluloid. As he gets a great performance, I couldn't help feeling that he then exceeded all his fellow players in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there. <br /> <br /> The effects of this movie are ridiculous but fun. The idea of ​​a dinosaur buried in a hollow wall and suddenly comes to life is B-movie gold. When "triceratops" are killed, see how it falls. Clearly, the stunt performer in the FRONT of the costume knows the timing best. He falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows. <br /> <br /> Talking about 'suits' there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur, in this flick. It seems to have some form of stealth technology, as Bunta (known for being the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until it is within its bitter range. I don't know how all prints are, but in the version I own, Tyranno's roar contains Godzilla's bellow brand. <br /> <br /> Watching if you like bad movies is lots of fun. I love them, and especially bad monster movies, so I consider this gem in my collection. If bad movies are your thing, you should definitely get it here.
