This film is a wonderful example of the quality dramas produced by Channel 4 and the BBC over the years. Ted Danson delivers a mighty performance of a man afflicted with memories that no one will accept and a society that thinks he is insane. It is a remarkable achievement by a man best known for his role in Cheers, a television comedy sitcom. The support supports are all very well chosen, not least Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who appears as part of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all, it is the seamless and very delicate shifts between our world and Gulliver's world that make this movie. The difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all acted by real actors, is beautifully captured. A rare treatment of film and direction.
