"The Missing Star", which competed for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2006, is a film that, when you think of it, is the first adjective to come to your mind, to be: intense. Intense looks, intense sequences, this movie intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes of the steelworks, in Italy (I couldn't recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is quite slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male leader, and with him, the entire audience, sees a completely different China than a normal western imagines: horrible high-rise with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desert, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which will soon become a great lake because of the controversial ditch that will wipe out many cities. China is a country under construction, but under all these colossal public works there is still poverty, backward and unfair laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more to this story because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal leaders: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a totally unknown girl who gives a such an intense interpretation as Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't perfect, there are some bugs here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre movie. Try to see it.
