After finally getting the DVD from this 1997 HBO movie, it's down to see it. When I finished it, the old saying said, "Those who cannot learn from the past, are doomed to revive it," echo the mind. First shown four years after the first bombing of twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11), the road to paradise shows the series of close meetings, blunders and official decisions that led to the first bombing of twin towers and the lessons We should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise has a great atmosphere of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the role of FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who not only face the threats to terrorism, but the lack of official interest from their superiors with their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli (Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsula, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and perform the attack, all of which play their roles not as potential cliches, but as real living people and make the movie all the better for it. Of special mention, Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem is the man who, if he had not been for skeptical FBI officials, could have had possible information about the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well-produced. Despite being made for cable, this movie does not feel like a low-budget movie at all with its production values, especially in its sets and New York City locations. The film's fascinating film film gives the film an almost documentary style at times. When all of these elements are combined with the script, it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events more and more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about his movie is its script. The events in the movie are true (minus some dramatic licenses that are always needed) and are becoming even more shocking, then they must have been when the movie was first shown twelve years ago. The movie just reveals how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They did so thanks to the lack of Arab translators, government agencies failed to pass on information to each other, the FBI ignores leads from a source and police departments are unable to retrieve guides. The worse is that the investigator's inability to connect dots is the fact that many of the same things did not only allow the 9.11 attacks to occur, but in some cases (like missing translators) are problems that continue even today. Even more chilling is the end that really happened and looks too prophetic today. Path To Paradise is a movie that should be crucial to see today. The film is not only well-acted and produced, but teaches us a lesson we should have learned before. Lesson of the movie? That those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to revive it. If you can find this movie then watch it and learn from it.
