I had the privilege of seeing Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of every actor and actress and Amenabar's incredible ability to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was known in Spain to ask for a legal euthanasia, lost trial and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass of poison that freezes all our hearts with its willingness not to live forever immobilized due to an accident. <br /> <br /> Before I watched the movie, I was already fascinated by the strong symbology in the title I wanted to translate as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to sea" and taken from An original poem written by the man this story is about. Then I saw the movie. Oh my friends. This is a movie theater with a capital C. The story flows to take you to the heart of every single character: Sampedro, reincarnated in a Bardem that you forget from the beginning, is in the center as a man full of humor and full of hope and his hope is to die, for to him the life he lives is not worth living. The rest of the characters, but one dances about him and respects his decision, because they see him as a human independent being (forgetting he depends on the others for everything), even though they love him so much. And it's about the movie: love. You can feel that you can breathe in the skin of any nature. You are witnessing the growing feeling within three women who meet him in the movie: Gené, a member of the association who defends his right to die with dignity, his friend, her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones who can live a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the midst of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic fate with Ramón, and eventually works in a way that we cannot but only understand. <br /> <br /> But before Ramón saw, she knew what was love because you can't meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his abused family: four characters unique in their humility and courage , each with their own thoughts about his decision, each thought respectable in its own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that no one is blaming for what happened. Unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this well-known quartet, I especially liked Mabel Rivera's work as Ramon's son-in-law, Manuela: a fantastic achievement. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes, which to me are the best climax points I've seen for a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie read this, pass over this section and read again from the next one that starts "Mar adentro", let the film show its secrets to you. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I've seen in a movie, when I really felt love invading the screen, is when Ramón dreams the wave that he flies to meet Julia on the beach and they kiss each other. 2. Gené speaks to Ramón by phone the day before he has to do it, and he tells her it is better that they say goodbye at the same moment, not to put her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows that this is the last time they have to speak and she has fought for her right to die ... but she won't lose him because she loves him as a true friend and even though she respects his decision at all costs. 1. The best. A young Ramón in the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumps to the water from the rocks to a sea that retreats. We see the crash, we hear his voice reminiscent of what happened and claim that he should have been dead at that moment. Bardems face, face down, shown us from the bottom. And a friend's hand pulling him from his forehead and bringing him back to a life that will be a hell for him for the next 30 years. There are many others as the impressive end, despite the fact that in Spain we know well what Ramon did. <br /> <br /> Mar adentro does not deceive me, Amenabar never does, but this time he has to thank the actors who participated in the project and who perhaps took it personally, because it is not just a movie it is an elegance for a man who died alone when he asked to die "lawfully", which meant him as Bardem pointed out to die with the people he loved and who loved him around.
