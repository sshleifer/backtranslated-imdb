I first saw this movie at HBO around 1983, and I loved it! I scour all the auction sites to buy the vhs copy. This is a very good tension movie with a few phrases that make it more interesting. I don't want to say too much else, because if you ever get a chance to see it, you'll be glad I didn't say too much!
