I read the comments about this movie before I saw it and didn't expect much, but as a B movie, it's a curiosity. I think you should be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but I seriously thought it was great. People should see it just for the experience because it is absolutely unique. Don't expect much from it. The action is bad, transitions were obviously done on a PC, etc. Absolutely a B movie, but still really worth checking out. Very funny. Mild gore, and some dubious themes, so probably nothing to show your spruce, but for the more adventurous viewer, I would say it's a must see.
