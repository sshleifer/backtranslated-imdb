I went into this thinking another brutal movie with gross humor. Telling from my first sentence, I do not like the humor and this movie had that moment, but I loved it. Justin Long has never really made comedies like this, where he is sarcastic and clever, and I loved it. Lewis Black .... probably said. The end I really loved because it had to take seriously, I mean how else would you finish it? Yes it is another underdog story, but not in your typical format, and the movie was not their ups and downs. It was people who came together for a common goal, to go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes, I laughed aloud as I didn't think I would and the laughter lasted longer than I thought. The parents and sisters played their roles well, but their characters are put in when needed. The film was not focused around them, but at the same time they turned out when you expected and didn't expect them. They played very well in history, and I loved the well-known faces of Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively certainly added her something to the movie, which made it even more fun, as well as B's Friends. I recommend this movie to the one who hated the brutal comedies of the past 4 years and really wants something with humor and an actual story line! ~!
