History of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonizing Venice. I don't know if it's a masterpiece, a poem, or a movie director's world play. It is definitely a "memento mori". and an illusion exploration. An old mirror of borders, signs and death delicacy. A trip in an old room, nostalgic, cruel and amazing. "Death" is an Orfeu's travel profile in immediate reality. And the essence is the music. A soft, sweet music, like honey or winter fire. Like any regret and grief. As a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is randomly gay. He is the researcher of the final form of God's presence. The beauty, the beauty that gives meaning to life, which is sin and virtue at the same time, the gift of expectations and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way. A sacrifice? No way! Only Tadzio can give freedom as an insignificant victim. Who saw the sun hope to live in the same state?
