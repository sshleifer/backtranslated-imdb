I just got home from my third show of the curse of the war rabbit and I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed that many Britons loved it, while in America they just didn't get it. It really does not come as a shock as America does not get what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle English, in fact, with a hint of excentricity throw in for good measure. The movie is much like our two heroes; simple and modest. It has a good and gentle plot, so the children are not lost, but there is enough beef to keep the adults amused too. There is some light induendo (which seems to have offended the gospel - oh no, drama!) But there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. When people are offended by a plastin anus, you know the world messed up ... A quick note to them (all Americans so far, I've seen) who think Chicken Run is a better movie: Chicken Run was made for That pans for your sense of humor and I think it suffered because of it. The rabbit's fake is witty, English and intelligent. The Thomas Tank engine's movie was destroyed because it was made to satisfy the Americans, and I'm glad Nick Park didn't allow it to another British institution. <br /> <br /> In summary: You can keep your chicken running, your Shreks, your Madagasga's - the kind of raw, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare with the white and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in the curse of Were- Rabbit. English to the core, and long time, Wallace and Gromit can stay that way.
