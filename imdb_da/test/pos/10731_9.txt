Kramer Vs. Kramer is a hard-hitting drama about shocking, drastic increases in the two issues of a failed couple. Meryl Streep plays in her trademark-sensitive sensitivity an unhappy living modality that feels limited to such a role, and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive man in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, finding another role for himself . Hoffman is a dumbstruck, has absolutely no idea what to do with himself, taking so much for granted that he was not getting his son to school in the morning. <br /> <br /> Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this man as such a juicy strain of setbacks. He is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side of the three adjectives must contain the opposite, he is incessantly fixed on what he is changing his head. He has been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is back to travel his son Billy all alone, chaos goes in straight away. He is the one who throws mood and turns half through an activity. After a while as he turns to his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. Meanwhile, his endless energy redirects to raise Billy and he loses his job. The custody of the title is an excellent gray matter. Although the end is a bit unmotivated, exposed to the audience, the last line and the last shot still have the female screenwriting that seemed to fall after the magical 1970s.
