I first saw this movie in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since, although I have never seen it since the first time. How easy can the lives of good people be destroyed by the pure evil then existed and still is a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and tremendously sad at the same time, and the role of Anthony Quinn is amazing. <br /> <br /> This film must be in all university studies on human inhumanity to man.
