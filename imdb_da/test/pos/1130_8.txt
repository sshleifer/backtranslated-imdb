I saw the pilot example of this with high expectations, as I just graduated and moved on to "reality". I wasn't in a fraternity, but many of my best friends were, and I had to attend a lot of the parties they did in their house so I know what happens to some extent. <br /> <br /> Of course, this show is a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life or college life for that matter, though it holds a lot of truth, though exaggerated for the most part. If you see the show for the value it contains as a TV show and no more, it is very entertaining, like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you see it, expect to chronicle all your experiences in Your own collegial life, you will probably either be left, want more or be angry at dramatizing many events.
