If you speak French or can put up with subtitles, you will really enjoy this movie. On the other hand, if you just want to see God's most beautiful creatures, then it is a must. Not an ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King eats your heart. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I ever imagined. Her part is even in English. Even the fact that she was naked with John Malkovich did not detract from her beauty. Sophie is a ten if ever there was one. Chiara Caselli and In√©s Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yes it's a pretty good story. Several small vignettes are woven together in a kind of six degrees of separation style.
