I thought this movie was pretty good! OK, so maybe it had some scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I've seen much more pathetic movies that have much higher ratings than this! Many movies today are remade to a more modern version, and there is nothing wrong with it, it keeps the story alive. I don't think this movie was pathetic at all, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a big Chad Michael Murray fan, but because I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we talked about it all the way home! I will tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie that has ever hit the cashier's office, but it's much better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, see it and then decide.
