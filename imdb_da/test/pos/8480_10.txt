I'm so happy when I look into the movie of (21st century) (Ray) to Sidney Pottier (Jamie Foxx), who played this role as a testament to his brilliant ability as an actor to stand out great actors in Hollywood by his golden support for the powerful abilities of African American actors of all time and times by his eternal work as a testament to the eternity of Ray Charles as a great proof of their playfulness in each and every time of their success in winning The Oscar award as (best actor for leading role) a (best mix sound) between facts and film scenes on Ray and Jamie as a mix between two copies of Ray (the past ray) and (ray of 2004 acted in Jamie Foxx person). It was nice of the director to choose the songs to be adapted with dramatic scenes in the movie's accidents to get into the atmosphere of success in playful corn with legendary movies in Hollywood since 1893 until now and his wisdom of choosing Sharon Warrne it his role as Ray's mother, she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the essence of her character, that Ray's mother was the turning point for him as she grew up to be independent of herself to take her place in this world and to be icon in his talent like (Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington) and at the end of this movie by receiving his honorable report from Gerogia and their decision to take his song (Georgia in my mind) the national anthem of that state he made promise that his mother lived until now through his playful songs and brilliant life.
