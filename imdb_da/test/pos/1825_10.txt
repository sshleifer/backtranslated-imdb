Valley Girl will always keep a special place in my heart: I would say this is definitely the best of 80s teen sex comedies, but it's a back-handed compliment. This is a good movie season. It's very specific in time and place - almost twenty years later this is a fantastic snapshot - but its history remains timeless. (It's just Romeo and Juliet, minus death!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful and shows all the early promise that he has hit out on blasted action crapola. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this movie, and I can't believe she didn't continue to get a bigger career; someone rediscovers her QUICK. This is sweeter and gentler than most movies in the genre - the necessary nudity seems to be the subject of contractual commitment - and although it is not groundbreaking, it is certainly nice to see this kind of film that respects its characters and does not cross its shallow young girls To Have Fun - Even Foreman's best friends, misunderstood by peer press, are never presented as villains. (In fact, her friend Stacy, forced to double w / Cage's friend Fred, is fine in spite of his protests and out with Fred in the back seat.) This will take you back to the early 80s if you was there, but it keeps pretty good today. Warning to those who are not familiar with the movie: DO NOT look at one of VH1's seemingly continuous beliefs about it - hire it in its unformed glory. Otherwise, you lack some of the film's most potent, time-specific dialogue. And you can't write about Valley Girl and don't mention the fabu soundtrack with 80-tune melodies - most of them with one-hit wonders, which are not only part of the time and place of this movie but thematically accepted. See it - great little girl! Go shur !!
