I watched this movie on a small screen. Though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a little gem of a movie. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters in their "mid-20s" and pursuing a kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) as they learn about Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and join Cobain Vigil. This is where the movie really captures and serves a variety of fun and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to Jimi Hendirx's tomb, Kurt Cobain's original childhood home and a camp fire singing together. An honest original piece of work.
