Contains Spoiler The movie is a good act / comedy, but I do not know if the instructor has cut too many parts, but it seems that the bad guy dies too fast. The end of the movie comes, the bad guy dies, and that's it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good, and I don't regret paying to watch it at the theater.
