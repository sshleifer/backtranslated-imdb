Only the British could make a movie like this and make it so tastefully charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more out of her life, but she doesn't know when she discovers she's in love with her childhood wife, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the local funeral home. Meanwhile, an American mortar (Christopher Walken), who "wants to put the" fun "back into funerals, moves into this little Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris a run for his money with flashy theme Funeral. (Star Trek funeral, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to donate Brenda's death and funeral with hilarious results - a very entertaining movie - if you are a fan of British comedies like "Waking Down Devine", you will love this.
