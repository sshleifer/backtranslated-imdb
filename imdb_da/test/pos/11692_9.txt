Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a good title. All the descriptions of this movie fail to capture what it really is ?? an adult adventure. A poor girl is wooed by a prince. The "girl" Marcela, played by the amazing Anna Geislerová, has an Isabelle Huppert beauty with a red hair, face and figure that is seductive, sexual and infinitely fascinating. She has a man's lice, but they have good sex. The children listen to lovemaking through walls. It is rough and passionate, as the working class sex seems to be often portrayed in movies. But it is also for us to recognize that this is what ties them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The man, a professional car thief, eventually gets caught and thrown into prison. How she got into this marriage, we do not know, but she is not even a high class herself. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we assume) and loves his beautiful and elastic children. She deserves more. And she can get the life she deserves - at last. (no spoiler!) She is forced to move back with mother after her husband is sent to prison. Mother has a scary second man (read ugly stepfather) He is a real horror show. He borders on being a child abuse for the children. He is obsessive about cleanliness, but ungraciously farts at the table, constantly demanding manners and decorum from the kids. He is really low class socially disabled wretch. Mom sets up with him as Marcella's husband, at least he is lusty - hefty but horny. The ambivalent, confusing, layered characterizations are what makes the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have errors, some seemed driven by the class, some of the innate character. These shortcomings and details of character are charming one minute and despicable the next. The audience must really negotiate conflicting sense of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and role as a woman as a mother and wife through the rapidly changing terrain of history. In the bottom line, the children, as with many films like the wonderful Icelandic film "Thicker Than Water (Bloodbands), can be victims. What is right in the end can be the best for the kids? Who is our salvation and our future. is a theme played out these days in films from Pan's Labyrinth to Children of Men, Foreign Cinema cinema recognizes in intricate moral stories that life is confusing, brutal, unfair and as adults we must get our action together to pass something that is worth for the next generation, if we give in to our basics, we can lose ourselves and the world in the process.The extraordinary and complex and colorful characters of Kráska v nesnázích speak to the qualities of what makes a man what drives a woman who perceives hope, what is the class - is the economic status of the substance in one's character? The film is really human as designed by the last 2 shots that moved me incredibly and unexpectedly. lg is so subtle and intelligent to compare this with an american movie seems unfair. Americans sometimes seem to lack a desire to consider that paradoxes in human nature do not offer decision making. But here are the dangerous moral issues that are dangerously spoiled in an unlikely adventure for adults. Don't be fooled by the simple story; This is a great movie.
