Crackerjack is a simple but emotional movie where the good are very good, and the evil ones are very bad, and the central character is tempted by both sides. The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central setting are the local lawns that were an exceptionally wide crowd, ranging from large numbers of teens to a large number of seniors - and all laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As expected from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, there were a lot of swords, but it was not overdone, and the audience I sat with was really good! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy blocker who joined the bowls club (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for leasing to others at a prize) but whoever has everything fall on him when he has to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a fine job as her local journalist / love interest, and there is fabulous pe John Wickson's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest, but he gives a solid performance. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle swipes on pokies give a bit of a serious note to this otherwise bright comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who enjoy The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie.
