Not many TV shows appeal to as many different kinds of fans as Farscape does ... I know young and 30/40+ years old; fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of, just love this tv miniseries. It has elements that can be found in almost all other shows on T.V, character-driven drama that could be from an Australian soap opera; But in the same episode, it has science facts and fiction that would give even the toughest "Trekkie" a race for its money in brain-bending stakes! Wormhole theory, Time Travel in Gender Equality ... Magnificent. It includes cultures from the whole card as the possibilities are endless to have more stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a wide range; It would be expected that nothing could stop the illusion for a long time, but here is where "Farscape" really comes into its own element ... It succeeds where everyone else has failed, especially as Star Trek (a universe with almost zero chaos element!) they ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them! Over the course of four seasons, they are able to keep the audience's attention through good continuity and constant multi-thread character development for each episode of unique personal details to the camera specific to specific character groups within it. This structure allows for an extremely large subject area, as loyalty is forged and broken in many ways on many many problems. I was watching the pilot (Premiere) in passing and just had to keep tuning for it to see if Crichton would ever "get the girl" after seeing them all on television I was happy to see them available on DVD and I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me healthy while I had to do a 12-hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that got me through the extremely long nights. .. <br /> do yourself a favor; See the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
