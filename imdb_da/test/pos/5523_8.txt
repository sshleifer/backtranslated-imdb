Haha, what a good little movie! Wayne Crawford strikes again, or rather it was his first big strike, an entertaining entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy that masked as a psycho-killer movie. It is actually a ** brilliant ** satire on post-hippie American culture in flyover, although the film was actually filmed independently in Miami. It can tolerate any kind of study-oriented convention or plot unit that I can think of: THE NUMBER OF MARTHA DOES DREADFUL THINGS can't be a very tech-savvy movie, but it's a wonderfully small piece of Americana made from the cheap of people who was honest, ambitious, imaginative and had balls made of steel. It took courageous, nerve and passion to make this movie, which surprisingly seems to have been the time test. This movie is fresh, vital, vibrant, unforgettable and fun strange enough to recommend to almost anyone with a sense of humor. I dug up last year for a time when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (here pictured under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a maestro of what can only be called regional film making, usually of the B grade variety. He is a writer, producer, director and actor all in one, probably best known for the 80's teenagers' apocalyptic favorite night's. Here he plays Stanley, the pants carry half a couple of really amazing characters, apparently gay spree killers on his pocket, after beating some old lady in Baltimore for her jewelry. Unsung screen legend Abe Zwick is absolutely convincing as Paul, who constitutes as Stanley's Aunt Martha, the cross-linking brain of outfits who has proclaimed Stanley to believe he has committed murder to secure his loyalty. Martha looks just as feminine as the seamen from SOUTH PACIFIC's support choirs in their coconut bikini tops, but somehow no one seems to notice - or care? - that she is a male, has no visible means of income, seems to spend the whole day scary about where Stanley is, and straddles the neighborhood in his bathrobe wearing a butcher's knife. Only in America ... When the film opens, two of them have just arrived in Florida and resided in what looks like Ward Cleaver's old house, a garishly lit and designed television home that is so cliché to be surreal. During a memorable scene, Martha and an unwelcome house guest are sitting on the couch, talking trouble and drinking cans of Budweiser in what is one of the most fascinating, subversive common sequences I've ever seen outside of a John Waters movie. Then there is Stanley who always comes in trouble when he is a mop topped hippie with a STP patch on his vest, driving a psychedelically painted van which is as subtle as Batmobile, drinking his milk right from the carton, snort medicine with blond bombshell bimbos, and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. Opposites attract, I think. But Stanley also has nothing to do with it when the young ladies he stents try to remove his pants, and it always seems to be up to Aunt Martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results. The bodies jump up, a nosy junkie challenges them to use their house as a flop, Stanley's birthday cake gets squashed and everyone meets at the local pizza shop before going to the backyard shed for a hookah hash party where girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a little too chummy with Martha, who obviously prefers to keep people in arm's length when they calmly invite themselves to a good conversation. And it is a woman who not only carries a butcher knife, but a loaded 0.38 in her slip. Eventually, the weird duo finds itself trapped with a body, a baby, and no place to go, and end up taking refuge in an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical staff borrowed the equipment used to make the movie. I just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves. Of course, a word should be said about Stanley and Martha / Paul's relationship when they dance that the two are at least suggested being a homosexual couple would miss the primary area of ​​the plot. We never see that the two become intimate, and although Stanley mockingly refers to being "balled" in a scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. It is certainly not a "gay" movie with abundant female nudity and an air of the 70's misogyny, which cannot be denied either. Stanley & Paul never consummated their implied sexuality on the screen, although the movie would certainly have had the courage to do so, if it was important. It's not the story is not about their gender, it's about the relationship they share and how weird it is. Not their homosexuals, but they are the different people they are, which are two of the weirdest movie creations ever to be in my TV. <br /> <br /> The movie is unique. It was made for just a few thousand dollars on what looks like borrowed studio sets, occasional placement work, and a few public places they managed to sneak a camera hood into because no one looked. The dialogue is completely bizarre, everyday and nice esoteric. It's a movie that surprises you, not everyone will like it, but for those with a taste for the low budget American horror / thrillers like THE NIGHT GOOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I am convinced that BLOOD & LACE and CHILDREN WILL NOT BE PLAYED WITH DEAD SINGER, You have got yourself a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: Normally I would say something like "Deserves a DVD Restoration" but somehow I think it would ruin the movie's sticky atmosphere. And Wayne Crawford, gentleman, gentleman.
