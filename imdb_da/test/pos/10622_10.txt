These movies made me like and I LOVED IT! LOVED IT! It haunted me for days. I think that Erika is the kind of character you at the same time leave and complain about. The most scary sex scene ever caught on film. This is the best in Haneke's work so far. He is the only living director to redefine the pace since Kubrick. The violence in this movie is beautiful. In one word, the film is about self-hatred. In a sentence, the film is about finding love to stop hating yourself and finding out that it is a hopeless hope.
