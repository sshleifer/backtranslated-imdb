It is a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80s generation who grew up to love the loose John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland and while I prefer other more bizarre, out-there flick, Better Off Dead, It's Hard For I Don't Like A Crazy Summer, A Movie I Grown Up And Beloved Wholeheartedly As A Child In My Teens. OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead, returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that movie. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, after graduation pal Joel Murray (George) to Nantucket for the summer for every fun on the beach. Hoops find themselves entangled in a feud with a blond buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing home in a neighborhood to build a huge condominium. One of the houses that needs the mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailboat race that is perhaps their only hope to save Cassandra's grandfather home (... he was recently passed), but it has been won by Teddy for the past many years, and Hoops is terrified of both water and water. . But with the help and motivation of new-found Nantucket friends (... like Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanical twin brothers!), George, and the emerging love interest of Cassandra, Hoops may be expressed with his fears and win the race to save neighborhood. Armstrong has a supportive part as the son of a boiling, manic weapon dealer, General Raymond (.. SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspired piece of casting), Ack who uses the training from his father to help Hoops and Company in their goal of winning the race . <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes include Bobcat, stuck in a Godzilla suit (!), which runs violently over an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's rather unhinged pops) condo, Hoops Being chased by outraged cub scouts who want to perform first aid, George a victim of toxic flatulence, Bruce Wagner's nutty Oncle Frank's growing insane every time he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show and the wonderful Billie Bird who George's grandmother actually bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven who (you guessed it) a brutal jerk who associates with Teddy and causes trouble for Hoops and his pose, the yummy Kimberly Foster as Cookie (.. Teddy's girl trying to make out with Hoops while he is attending a lunch with his father) and the only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted who will not reward his son and grandson a legacy if they lose the sailboat fight. Demi Moore is cute, but it's Cusack's vehicle, though Bobcat and Villard steal most of their scenes. Again, some lovely animations from the Netherlands are splashed through the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriate). If you like his movie, I highly recommend the underrated how I entered college.
