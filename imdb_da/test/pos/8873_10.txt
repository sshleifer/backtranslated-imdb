In a really nice spin on Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry's ex-wife has become rich by publishing a book he wrote, and Owen has the most indulgent mother . When Larry tells Owen to calm down by "Strangers on a Train", the Owen gets the idea that they should make crossed murders as in the movie. And, like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How they came up with the idea of ​​"Throw Momma from the Train" I never know, but it's a fun movie. There is not a dull moment in it. And it ended up being a hoot. Krystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as much of a favor here as she was in "The Goonies". A modern classic.
