What makes watching and browsing movies a pleasure when every once in a while when you least expect it a movie that The Cell brings together and knocks your socks out! This movie is a great scare that has everything you could want when you want to be scared of your jokes. Without going into history, all I want to say is that it has a good beginning, middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being transfixed with the amazing special effects. The action is good without being excellent, but it doesn't matter because the subject and the way it's put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies I've seen for a long time. It's one of the movies you imagine starting out as a novel, but say the credits, it doesn't look like an adaptation, so much credit should go to Mark Protosovich's author. 9 out of 10
