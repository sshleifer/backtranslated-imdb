I can't get over the quality of the score, book and performances. This is the first production I've ever seen from Sweeney Todd, so I have no one else to compare with. But the effect is so strong, I just can't imagine any better. <br /> <br /> First there is the music - take "Johanna" (Act II), where Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing a interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It's like a Bach coral in that sense - just a masterpiece of composition. And the underlying chord construction and voicings are so perfect - a little melancholy, a bit of satisfaction, a little longing, all expressing the views of these three singers. <br /> <br /> So - - the lyrics. The Rhymes are so clever. Space schemes sometimes occur randomly, but they always add at the end. (The DVD that I watched has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating dialogue and texts.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone. <br /> <br /> Finally the performances. I can't imagine any better than George Hearn. Why haven't I heard about him before? His song alone is masterful, but the range of his plays is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song of "you and me down by the sea" - who could do better? Her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score stands; And overlaying this achievement in music is her utterly lovely comic delivery. <br /> <br /> It's a dark story, but I found it to be cute at times; and the song of "Johanna" continues to play in my head.
