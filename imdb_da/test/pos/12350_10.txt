One Dark Night features a typical teenage horror movie set-up with a unique twist. The ultra-brooding musical score and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere adds a lot to this little movie that delivers. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a sense of vanity and loneliness. The other teenagers are just as effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the movie's ultimate heroine. The special effects are excellent, yet dated. This movie is much overlooked, but it can be good so it was never destroyed by endless followers. There is a great, dark magic flowing through this movie; When you are tapped, you really get it and you're in for fun. The double-disc DVD is available even though the original negative could not be found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be located. I believe in some ways that the coal tips in parts help the film by giving it an old school of respectability and making it more unexpected at the end when there are a lot of effects. The other disk has a rough / alternative version with a tempo state version of the movie that gives a more explanation of the assault of two of the girls, much Poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado" is going to think in a new way!) Also good Termination voltage goes into the dark crypto aperture. Not sure it had a blow to the main stream audience, but certainly the work for me and extremely creepy. There is also a documentary film that is interesting because it provides information on what was happening at the time of the actors, crew, director and author; honest material, so current logos, discussions about shots and scenes, exercises. Very unique that these things exist for a small movie since then.
