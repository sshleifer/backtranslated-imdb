This is the first Pepe Le Pew cartoon and in some ways it looks very much like it later, but in a few other odd ways it is not. While the subject of Pepes love is a cat, it looks like it's a BOY cat! This whole problem arises because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dressing up as a skunk and trying to smell like a skunk so it can stand alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is quite typical until the very fun and unexpected ending - and this makes it one of the best of all cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this a goalie.
