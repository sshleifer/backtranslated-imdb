I found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful Henry Mancici music didn't hit me. Julie Andrews was excellent and I certainly don't understand why this movie had problems at the cashier's office when it came out because it just makes me happy at last to get everyone to sing. and i like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie along with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
