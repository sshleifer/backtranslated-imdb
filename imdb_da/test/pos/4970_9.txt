Deep Blood ... Its one of them you are filming here and you don't say another Italian jaw ripoff! Well, Deep Blood is far from it. It is cheap as film production can get, and on the other hand it is also creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen or crew about, everyone uses fake sharks, good at Joe D'Amato's movie, he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scene. This is one of the many reasons I like Deep Blood so much because it didn't use storage shots. In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, in Joe D'Amato's Shark Classic Deep Blood. It seems that an Indian elder once warned a group of young people about this great evil in the sea, and years later, friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of coastal attacks. Now it is up to the remaining few to ensure that this monster is killed, even if it means going out to sea to do so. Joe D'Amato ruled and produced this film under his company Filmirage. Published in 1989 and later used in Bruno Mattei's Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5, along with many other shark films. Joe D'Amato's shark entry is a great movie and any Joe D'Amato shark movie consultant fan should give it a try.
