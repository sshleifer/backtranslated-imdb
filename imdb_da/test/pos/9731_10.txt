It is great to see a new series of puppets that create chaos in this series. I found this chapter very fun. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. This movie has very little violence and is only classified PG-13. This is particularly different from the other R-rated puppet master films that were filled with gore and violent chaos. However, the lack of violence does not reduce fun. This movie also has especially better special effects than the last movie in this series. Well.
