A respectable royal rumble event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... Kant's heel performance was sublime as it was during the rumble incident. Overall id say EDGES NIGHT .... <br /> 2. Undertaker Vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> <br /> Many people hated this rivalry, even though I liked it, I thought heidenreich really played its character well. The fight was not great in excitement that was until the ridge and the slitcky became involved. It gets better as it happens. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle Vs Big Show vs JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good camp, as there was only one really exciting i calling in it .. .. very good title match .. good pace .. even if a predictable end. But, not all royal rumble title matches are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) Vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 not really that good for the men involved, went on too many dry spots , orton sold his concussion unbelievably, but ended up being somewhat of an anti climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... btw during the other matches there were a few segments ... two that were really cool ... cena rapping on Christian and Guerrero stealing the flair's number 30 entrance ticket. the event was good 7/10 would have gotten a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy wins the batista (WHY UNDERSTANDS WHY) ..sevin comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena jumps up in laughter.
