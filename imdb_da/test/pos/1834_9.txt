There are so many positive reviews on Return to Me that my opinion is not needed to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt has proven that she is not only an extraordinary actress, but also an amazing director and screenwriter. This movie has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Don't miss it, wait no longer. And as for the bad reviews, don't be aware. Some viewers forget that this type of movie should be monitored with your heart, not just with your eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or You have Mail, it's their fault. For me, Return to Me is a real gem, an unforgettable movie.
