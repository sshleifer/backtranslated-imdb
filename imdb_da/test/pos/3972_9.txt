From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The movie took a while to get from the start, at least for me to see when I expected this to be a run-along America Pie flick. But it was a little different - a fun loving slacker who finishes high school and does his own college, runs it accordingly. As you can expect, there are many parties and hot girls in bikinis, but this movie tried harder than your average teenage girl. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of speech and ultimately "push it to the system." The humor was varied, which I loved. All the fantastic performances - Rent this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack!
