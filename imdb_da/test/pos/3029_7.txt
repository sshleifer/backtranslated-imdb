This movie is definitely a case of style over matter, but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make "The Cell" a memorable and above average movie. "The Cell" is beautiful looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's real eye-catcher to see everything. The film has some "dreamy" sequences that are surely strange but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect blend of an art-house-type movie and a typical Hollywood thriller available to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite far-fetched and does not always make sense. Because of that, the film is not always comfortable and looks like, but as I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep an eye on the end and gives the best moments in the movie. Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underutilized as an actor and this movie shows his talent again. I'm not very happy about the release of Jennifer Lopez. I know she can act in some of her movies, but she really wasn't fit to play the protagonist of this movie. Her character was not strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. I still felt that Vince Vaughn was also mistaken for this movie. He didn't fit well enough for the role and no, I don't say, because I'm only used to seeing him only in comedies now days. The rest of the support is good and still gives the film some degree of credibility. <br /> <br /> The musical score of Howard Shore was also surprisingly good and was kind of "Se7en" as at times. It suited the film well and gave some of the scene a little extra atmosphere and atmosphere. It is far from perfect movie, and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still "The Cell" is a perfect ductile movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see because of its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
