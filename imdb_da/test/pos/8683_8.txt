All I can say is what I expected a wick movie and "The Blur" surprised me positively. Very nice teen movie. All of these situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that all of this reminded me of my school hours, and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movie because we entertain and get back to the golden years. when we were young. Let us also think better of the way we understand our children because we were formerly like they will be in the present time. Try this movie and you will be very happy. At the same time, you will have the guarantee that your time is not wasted.
