After reading a biography of the last Russian Emperor (Nicholas II) and his inability to secure the army's support, I decided to give this movie a try. <br /> <br /> I saw it with a completely open mind, not knowing about it (except its reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) the images of battleships and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped thinking "if this was done at this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer generated". <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in it. From the mutton-infested meats to the shots of the sailor with his light and the text "Killed for a bowl of soup", this film gives no concessions to the PC cause (which, fortunately, had not been invented yet). <br /> <br /> 3) The slow descent of madness in the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when the relentless man emerges, you get the idea that something can be wrong; As the combined images are composed, you stop feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputant appears and people begin to fall into dramatic situations. However, the shoots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear to be the scene and the incredible shots appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this movie is 100% unadultered propaganda. So again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he also had something to do with "propaganda"; only another kind. <br /> <br /> All in all: a movie marbled by a bit of a slow story. Nevertheless, Metropolis, the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their profits today. They make really modern movies look dull and repetitive.
