I wish there were more films about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be another judicial standard for women who have extra matrimonial matters than men. Amy Watson's damaging and humiliating behavior towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reversing the roles and one could expect a condemnation of condemnation to the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental, she might have told him, left and waited for a major financial settlement at divorce. The country and the London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich, while the harvestable weather adds the melancholy backdrop to excellent. The finish is perfect so it is in line with real adult life.
