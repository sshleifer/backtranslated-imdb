The show starts with the boat. Desmond I was. Then they went to try to save Walt. And locking things that the button presses is a great joke, while Desmond found out he was the one who crashed the plane. Eko is trying to open the door, which Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan it, Sasyid is finding the others first and seeing who and what the other is. And find out if there are armed and have any weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo in a trap. And they get caught. <br /> <br /> After the show there were several questions, so answered, but what makes the show good. And can't wait for season 3
