This is undoubtedly the biggest spin to Jackass ever made, hell, it even knocks Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> The picture here: You have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up, throw in lots of money and some seriously cool stunts, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show, it is such a family-based, and it's not just the "gang" running around being complete jerks (like in Jackass), for example: Bo's parents, April and Phil, are in every episode, with the play of BAM's obesity uncle, Don Vito starting! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: Someone in our family can relate April: The woman who wants to live the life of the book and follow the tradition Phil: The guy trying to be a good father, and finally, Bam: The son who never grew out of high school, the pranks and jokes in each episode will give you a guaranteed laugh and buying DVDs is definitely recommended Another thing that is surprising to see is how relaxed Margera is all over, he said in interviews that for most episodes he does not work and works just outside of instinct. All in all, however, the amount of influence Margera has over MTV, he wanted Slayer to play in him s backyard, MTV did it. He wanted to hang out with Dani Filth for a day and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his backyard, it happened. <br /> <br /> Add to this his passion for love metal (and debated as emo) band HIM and his brother's garage band CKY, and there's a lot of head bending going on. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jackass, you will fall in love with this. I borrowed season 1 from a friend last year and I would give up my legs to meet Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed and I can promise you will be in the stitch at the end of it all!
