Beginning in 1965, American films began to return to the shocking and iconoclastic, which was great at times - the sort of seeds that would pave the way for gritters, bold dramas. But because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so controlled by its own beliefs, most of the films released during this period are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Its very title suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy with occasional falloffs in risqué. This is not to say that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, movies about risqué topic must begin somewhere, and America is a culture rooted in specific traditions, even twisted in deep hypocrisy, choking itself for its sake when one sees an indirect reflection of the mothers of the times. Meanwhile, European films take on the same situations, go away and look like a million bucks and have longer durability, because what we consider scandalous they pull away, says "Next" and continues. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in his breakout role), a young, very sixty bright young thing, continues with a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) who has engagement problems. He can't marry her: he's already married. Toni decides instead to turn away, she actually wants to meet her wife and "put things right". In the picture comes his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a shining Ingrid Bergman, returning to American cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman closer to his age, which seems like she and he had the perfect marriage and household. There is a reason for this: she has had calm feelings for Julian, feelings he is not aware of even when he asks her to play his wife to avert Toni from wanting to move on with their relationship. And then, as Toni is happy innocent acts, he steps up the action unexpectedly and introduces Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's "lover". By the way, Harvey is also an older gentleman who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce), whom he is also in a very fun scene. It's fun how the person we are looking for is the one who has always been there. What could have been a grateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor neighbor, turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty of other exiled Stephanie, but the one who saves Toni from the start, killing himself self. (Not comedy, suicide. Then again it is not your average comedy.) And of course, it is Ingrid Bergman's subtle, sharp depiction of a woman who has somehow missed her chances of love, who has become stingy, who Because of a lie said to another, she becomes the real person she was always supposed to be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role. Movies like these can be enjoyed face to face and seen as escapist fun - a product of its times - or seen for the deep symbolism that, as its title, carries it deep inside. It's a tricky movie, just as Hawn's and Bergman's performances are just as difficult because they seem so simple, devoid of flourishing and pose, nor come out and proclaim what they're about. Their action becomes "not really acting", but plays true people, warts and everything. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to take itself too seriously, but shows itself to be deep and very human.
