I generally love SRK as a villain (how can you not?), And I think that SRK and Juhi are a perfect match on the screen as they are both actually more cozy than beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for even though it has some big flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) the good guy (Sunny) - not only he is so much less attractive than Shahrukh (it is, in my opinion, so important in Bollyfilms), but his role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier. <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran's and Sunil's responses to Rahul's actions are incredibly stupid and naive even for a bollywood production <br /> But all this is not so important to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, good songs (really really big) and (let's say it again) Shahrukh as a villain, I just love him when he is so pagal <br /> <br /> A must-see (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
