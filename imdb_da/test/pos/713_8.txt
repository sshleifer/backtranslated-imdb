An interesting and involved movie about a "lifer" who just tries to live his days peacefully. The protagonist's elements appear from Michael Mann's later film, Thief (1981), Heat (1995) and so on. You can view this at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory - one of the only places in the country that has copies available to the public. It's a fantastic one!
