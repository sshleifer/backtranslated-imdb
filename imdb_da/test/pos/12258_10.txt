Broadcast News James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it lacks the emotional impact of Brook's debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative movie, with exceptional performances from each of the three leaders and a script that feels like genuine and well-researched as a hard hit news report. Let it be known, this is a character film primarily and a satire second. In my opinion, both levels succeed on their own terms. The film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension, while the satire remains blunt and never bitter. Comparisons with networks are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. While also a large movie is networking cynical and tired work; in other words, it is sour as hell and tired of the TV state. The network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters that fill the newsroom for Broadcast News and live for their jobs (sometimes detrimental to their love life) love the news and stress of contentment, as well as the audience enjoying seeing this sweet and romantic realistic masterpiece.
