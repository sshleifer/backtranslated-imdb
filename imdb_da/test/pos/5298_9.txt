I have a strong feeling that what you think of this movie will be heavily dependent on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it'll probably confuse your heel out of you. If you've seen a Miyazaki movie before, it probably will confuse the heel of you .... but you won't really care! That's because I found out that, for the first time, when I saw one of his animated films, I was trying too hard to figure out what happened and why - and that affects my enjoyment of the movie. Now that I've seen almost every Miyazaki movie, I see the bizarre movie and take it all in - enjoy it all in beauty. In many ways, these films (at least to the western audience) are like fabrics - lots of strange and beautiful pictures that don't always make sense, but it's probably good to see !! Of all the Miyazaki films, this can have the most unusual and incomprehensible storyline - even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But like these and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you just lean and look at you, you are rewarded with a fantastic story. But because it's so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there. <br /> <br /> Regarding the artwork, it is very typical of one of these Japanese films, although there was a noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for backgrounds. This was not a bad thing at all - the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a little bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, unique character animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great "wow factor", this is an excellent movie for all ages. Although it is clearly designed more for younger audiences (especially TOTORO fans), it is a little scary here and there (during the storm segments), but there are plenty of good things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically like that), I loved the sweet things and welcomed the film's second world quality. A great movie - among Miyazaki's best. I don't give it a 10 because I hesitate ever - plus I liked a couple of the other movies a bit more (especially TOTORO). But that doesn't mean you shouldn't hurry now and see it - do it and do yourself a favor.
