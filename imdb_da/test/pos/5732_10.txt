My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe." After three hours of seeing it, besides having my brain hurt, I learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternative universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was about "String Theory" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics that makes many of the ideas of science fiction not only possible but PROBABLE. With "String Theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternative realities, and alternative timelines are possible, and it can just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have given New Information to anyone who is familiar with the subject, I found the show very interesting and informative. It was very understandable for anyone who has just been introduced to this topic.
