PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You shouldn't hurry when Paris is killed in the head with a tube! It's totally rude! What did Paris do for you? What if it was you? You didn't want people to cheer for your death! It was gory anyway, which I liked, and it was cool when Elisa's finger was cut off. It was strange with the twist that they did not have 2 sons they had wood and all that made room for a House of Wax 2: Resource or something. Paris was a great play in the chase scene. Elisa and Chad chemistry are fantastic, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I blew up when the guy said it's hot when Paris and the cousin Skeeter guy make out. Lol.K goodbye.
