Jim Henson such as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz like Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt like Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz like Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> cameos by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet movie in the billions of others to come out and is also the best, by far! This is about Kermit, the frog on a trip to Hollywood and meets the other characters along the way. This movie, along with being already good, has excellent songs performed by Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, can you see it? Moves straight together and others. This film, unlike the other Muppet flicks, carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a good movie. Also noted there are many cameos featuring Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> My rating-a plus. 109 minutes. rated G.
