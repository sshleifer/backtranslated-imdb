Definitely worth the rent! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year olds (and I) loved it. Hold them on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit with their younger children to see this as it can be quite exciting for them. It's not too often you can find movies you can see in your children, and then this is a rare find. Some of the play / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe it's a bit corny, but kids don't seem to notice or care, they love it. Parts are predictable, but other parts are not like trying to figure out who the good are and who the evil ones are. The movie doesn't have any really scary stuff, and I doubt it will give children nightmares. It inspires children to dream, which is something we should encourage and promote more in our children. Rent and blessed!
