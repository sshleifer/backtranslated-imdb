It was clear until the last credits that this film was made in 1989, when all the elements of its production were made to look like in the 1960s - the play, the characterization, the sets and the props all had an aesthetics from an earlier time. /> <br /> The movie opens to the moments before the A bomb has fallen on Hiroshima and how this tragic event hits a family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards, but emotional and effective, the depictions of the immediate success of the bomb are quite awful. Family members become unrecognizable to each other, others resemble zombies as they walk in the streets that are failing and in shock. The title refers to precipitation that fell shortly after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash and in which Yasuko is caught Smoker about Yasuko's being in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing affects her marriage prospects, and it is later learned that black rain actually causes diseases. The film is not only concerned about the physical effects of the bomb in Japanese, but also on the social and psychological damage that was done. <br /> <br /> I found the movie compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film is primarily concerned about the pain of a family, the film's gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all wars, it has terrible consequences and should not be concluded unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats itself, and the present leaders of "the will of the will" have not learned anything. While the nuclear war period has not been restored since 1945, other deadly repercussions have occurred. This movie is convincing.
