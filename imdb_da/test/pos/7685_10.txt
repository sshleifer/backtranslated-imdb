I was in my early 20's, just college graduation when this movie appeared. Since it was a great influence, not only because of the film's high quality (as evidenced by its many awards), but because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to social progress since then, it is almost impossible to acknowledged that my college first began to admit (carefully screened) black students in 1953. An ordinary, high-budget extravagance with almost completely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The movie was given a deluxe roadshow ( reserved seat) presentation at only the best theaters, complete with a souvenir program describing the lavish care taken with lighting and color, multi-track stereo sound, etc. Almost every black entertainer whom we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie. Gershwin's music, superbly executed, and the pure universal humanity of history was tremendously moved. <br /> <br /> I was recently able to get a faded copy of a two-hour cut of the movie and repeated views have confirmed my opinion. Time has done what seemed that steaming sex scenes in 1959 seem rather tame, but the musical quality has not fallen. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their depictions. What a crime that young black artists today cannot see these artists at the top of their career!
