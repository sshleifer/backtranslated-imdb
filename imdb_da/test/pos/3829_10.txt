Without a doubt one of the best episodes ever, Terrorbalance 45 minutes of successful excitement is with intelligent real parallels (the title refers to a situation much like what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second-largest hostile alien race after Klingons: Romulans. <br /> <br /> After receiving an emergency call from a federal post, the company is dangerously close to the neutral zone, which if crossed would lead to open conflict with the romulans, even though no one has ever seen them in the flesh. Soon, a Romulan vessel carrying a new weapon and a cutting device will make it almost impossible to defeat. Unlike the threat of impending extinction, Kirk must engage in a fight with wits with Romulan Commander (Mark Lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. Unfortunately, the task is more difficult when one of the men accuses Spock of being in league with the enemy because of the physical similarity between Romulan and Vulcans, two races that are actually remotely related (a fact that is quite ironic with retrospect, en Lenard continued to play Spock's father Sarek, starting with season 2). <br /> <br /> Always very critical when it comes to warfare, Star Trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and thrilling take up topic. Although the Romulans are not actually based on the Soviets (the name is actually taken from Romulus, the founder of Rome), the scenario is clearly inspired by the very vivid fears that American and Russian citizens had at the time when neither nation could be could destroy the other with nuclear weapons (the fear gave birth to the titular concept of "the balance of terror"). But even without the subtitle, this is an important episode, which is due mostly to the intellectual battle between the two opponents, turning into an exciting duel between Shatner and Lenard. No need to say who wins ...
