The above line summarizes it quite well. The best comics are the visual gags and word jokes (the latter is almost impossible to translate, so the comics are best in their original language). Both are pretty hard to catch in movies, and therefore they will never be as good as the comics. Movies are simply a medium other than comics. With that in mind, this movie makes surprisingly good at taking the fun of the comic. <br /> <br /> The word gags is tolerable and sometimes even funny (Debouze makes an Amelie reference!). I must mention that I saw the French version. If you do not see the French version or your lack of understanding of the French language, limit yourself to the subtitles, the word jokes will probably suck. <br /> <br /> Slapstick is okay too; It's a very simple kind of humor, and not really fun when you're older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comic. The other visual jokes are the film's saving grace for the older audience, as they are often very funny. The action is completely over the top, but again it is not annoying at all, as it captures the spirit of the comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not really overstate, which may be why some people think they do not enjoy their roles (I have not noticed). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich become overactive for an art form. It is actually fun to see. Again, I fear it would be almost as fun when the votes are dubbed. <br /> <br /> Generally, not a bad movie much better than the previous one. It's not a classic, and it doesn't ruin The Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. The French version, that is. 10.7
