This movie is undoubtedly the best I've seen in my entire life. The Stellar Star is only an added bonus over the amazing special effects and deep history and sublime choreography. The film is about an old love affair that folds down into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven incur a great anointing anger and are cursed. Then the woman is born again on earth. While in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film basically focuses on hunting down the people associated with rape by her lover who possesses superhuman strength and mastery of multiple languages. Sonu Nigam delivers a very mature and profound performance in this movie, and all the other actors do almost as well. Tea action scenes with Akshay Kumar are mindset and must not be missed. Just watch this movie !!!
