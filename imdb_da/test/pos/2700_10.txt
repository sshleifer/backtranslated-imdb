I've seen the King of Queens from the beginning and have felt overlooked on the prizes. This show has the best humor you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about it at work a lot because I work on a company much like IPS, (DHL) and we just love Teamster slots !! Carrie is my hero, she's the best she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur, what can you say? He just cracks you and really jumps on things. Doug, he's just so lovable, and fun, the three characters, plus all the friends just make the show complete. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'd say up there with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that .... Excellent !! as Doug would say.
