How can any DARE say something BAD about this movie? Excuse Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets more fun every time you see it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this, I was crying out to laugh so hard. Everything about it is fun. <br /> <br /> While "Robin Hood: But in Tights" is not my favorite comedy (the place is taken by "Real Genius"), it goes a long way in my book. So go see it! If you do not constantly laugh, then you will at least spend all the time throwing yourself over Cary Elwes.
