One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wished it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the carpenters, and this film did what it could, based on the limitations imposed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I've done about the disease (especially the wonderful book by Cherry Boone O'Neill, Hungry for Attention), anorexia seems to be a disease of control. Karen saw her weight as a thing in her life that she could control. She felt she was ruled in all other aspects of her life. Don't make me wrong, I thought she really loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. She really loved her family, but they didn't express it well, and she didn't know how to get her family to understand her. The movie could have touched so much more on it. I treasure the music I have of the carpenters and want her to still live to contribute more to music today.
