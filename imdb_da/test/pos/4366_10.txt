Yes, this movie was just fun and the play was top notch from the whole cast. Except for Shelley Winter's German accent, it wasn't that great, but it doesn't matter when she's hardly in the movie. So if you are a fan of her beware! The two biggest stars of this movie are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now before this movie, I would only see Miss Harris in the East of Eden with James Dean and I own a tape by The Glass Menagerie, which she did on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and dear, she impressed me how hammy was she? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my fancy! I am now a full time Laurence Harvey fan! That hair !!! * tiles * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get any better than that. He is young and so innocent in this movie. SEE IT NOW! It is certainly in my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy that's all mine! Unfortunately, this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :( <br /> <br /> Btw, take care of the hospital hotel room !!!!! It's one of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey has convinced himself, he's sick and he's trying to get his knee to kick, you know how doctors do with the little rubber hammer ;-) Well he does himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table * squeals * Check the look of his face, so innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but to all the people who say he couldn't act very well and other cockamamie comments, watch this movie and you'll see what a great actor he really was. You are thrown over! If you're not, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you, you're hopeless. ;-)
