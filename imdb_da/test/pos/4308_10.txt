"Müllers Büro" is a movie that many will see and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. It is a parody of detective film with all directions; The action takes place only at night in dark corners of a city resembling Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, police car, chasing criminals, etc.). It's also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters like Müller's secretary and Vitasek's (actor playing Müller's assistant) lover who does their best to sing, though not very successfully. <br /> <br /> The rooms occupied by the characters have their own presence in the movie as the decadent blue box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna), where one can see a sailor hitting a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint smeared on walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's bureau with the sweet image of his assistant etc. The humorous moments in the film are many and include "flat in the face" the kind of humor that Müller captures in the face of his employees, the prostitutes charge Müller extra to orgasm, the ridiculous clothes from the Montana gays, etc. <br /> < br>> A legendary 80s film, especially for those interested in Austrian or German speaking cinema.
