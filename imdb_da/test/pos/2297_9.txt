I really liked this one. (SPOILERS ??) It had a really good plot, the biggest woman in this movie is really kewl. Despite the fact that she is the only one who lived alive and her lover dead, it seemed to be much like Ninja Scroll. Another kick ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Look at Japanese with subtitles. I don't know where the idiots who learned to speak English are, but for some reason, all dubs get an F in translation techniques. The subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10
