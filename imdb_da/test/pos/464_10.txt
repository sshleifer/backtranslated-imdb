Even though it was dark, depressing, and sometimes difficult to see, you alone were aware of me and were refreshingly honest in their dialogue. It really caught the fear of teen romantic relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was fantastic. The lyrics and song's tone complemented the sadness of the movie so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I've ever seen. Her convincing and credible performance made the film. It made me wonder if she really is a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway, the movie was very worth seeing. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yeah, that's right.
