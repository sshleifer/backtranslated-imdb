After I read that "At the time of its release in 2002, its $ 47 million budget, or FRF 327 million, was said to make it the most expensive French movie ever. However, Astérix et Obélix contre Cesar (1999) had a budget of 48 million. $ FRF 274 620 000, which allegedly made it the most expensive French film ever. "I discovered the reason I found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all I've ever seen. I loved the scenarios, the clothes (especially those from Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! cheerful! I found the jokes chic and fun, and I have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies all the time! Cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful as Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, Christian Olavix, Christian Clavier , Jamel Debbouze (who I saw for the first time in '' Amélie Poulain '') among others! :) I recommend this movie even to people who don't do I do not know Asterix and Obelix cartoons. You must have a lot of fun! :) aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleopatra" - Brazil
