My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or profanity. No zillion dollar special effects were added to try to mislead viewers from a badly written story. A simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we only got to hear some of the songs ... Mostly during the final credits ... Would love to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. With all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to see, this Hillman has no risk assessment. We love his movie.
