One of his lesser known films, many horror fans have not yet caught this Dario Argento offer, which is unfortunate. It is underappreciated mainly because of the fact that not really enough people have seen it. The movie boasts class-A Argento Gore, with its usual close-ups set to savage rock scores. Although it is true that this script is not very complex, it is almost as bad as other entries in its genre or his own personal CV for that matter. <br /> <br /> This movie symbolizes more of the "fear" that he likes to portray in his films by his own recording. Worth looking good on any evening.
