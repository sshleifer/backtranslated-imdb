This sad romance is untellable, because the instructor decides to break his narrative and offer the views on each character. So there are many flashbacks about resuming the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment with the cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it because it's for me only one of the best French movies ever made! <br /> <br /> It has it all: <br/> <br /> Cast: first step by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard hearing! It is symbolic that they have fallen in love with this movie! Management: his camera is bright, vibrant, plays with the sets or can be mysterious with a long close-up "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love! <br /> <br /> A never seen before Paris: It's more accurate in Paris outside of time, a combination of many districts! Huge search here! It looks like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect harmony with the framework. And the song for Charles Aznavour made me discover this amazing singer! <br /> <br /> Oh, ?? the story! As I said, it is a love story, but rather tragic: To say that love can be for nothing, it does not make all people happy or not guaranteed a sweet ending is great because this message is not often told! Love is passion derived from the Latin "pain". You like a lot when you are in love! Because of why ..?, The infinite waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /> <br /> And when you can ease yourself, fate, god (?), devil (?) can stab you back just because you arrive too fast or too late, and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and so many stories can be written! So what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived a few moments like this: in a car with the dear. Her mobile phone rings and you know it's her "special friend" she kisses goodbye (and not even if we're always together). So you want to leave this car to leave them together not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can't because a terrific rain just started! <br /> <br /> I found out that this movie portrays these moments of tragedy like no other!
