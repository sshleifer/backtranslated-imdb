I encountered this movie while channel surfing one day; and decided to give it a try. To my surprise, I enjoyed this darkhorse movie. I felt a real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a noisy and hot movie that when it was over, I felt optimistic. Sure, this movie was predictable from the beginning, but I give it high marks for the way it made me feel when it was over. I have to admit that I have never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel she can surely act. When you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure. She intends at least to become a known star.
