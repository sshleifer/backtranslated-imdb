Well worth the price for Rock-off alone !! Any D-fan will love this movie (although it is a little short) and cameos from John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just about recognizable) show that D-rock is tough enough for anyone. Even Dio ... Sasquatch / mushroom scene will be an instant classic (I will not say more and be accused of putting spoilers in here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a few nods to D's early screens in characters like Lee and the open mic host. I only wish they had played a few songs from the first album, and the omission of the 'government sugar completely' from the POD album is also a shame. Except that this movie clips. Observe D!
