A tightly crushed musical family, cranky-benevolent father and four lively young daughters are bred primarily by the appearance of Felix, a bursting young composer, and secondly and in-depth, Mickey, his incredibly attractive orchestra friends. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for Michael Curtiz to get this piece of Americana floating. The first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal product, not without a certain picturesque, bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield enters the scene as the convicted Mickey who makes his first appearance in motion pictures with mussed-up black curls, sleepy, hanging eyes, rude and disheveled, the absolute opposite of Jeffrey Lynn's smoothly convincing, evil charming Felix. Garfield is in perfect, and DIREKT needs, to resist the rest of the household ("Nothing I would do would surprise me", he muses), and suddenly the movie becomes interesting even though I agree with critics who find the plot turns insufficient motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters are pretty gently played and seriously signed, but Claude Rains as pater familias has his moments. See it for Garfield, though he is the only real lasting thing about it.
