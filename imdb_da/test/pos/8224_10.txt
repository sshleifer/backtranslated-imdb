Flying, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic play piece that translates well into the small screen. Full of quick and sparkling dialogue and some of the best physical comedies in the decade, it's head and shoulders over 99% of "Comedy" as it is presented today. I'm sure one day will take its rightful place with such great shows as "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot." Why it's not available on DVD yet is a mystery and a tragedy.
