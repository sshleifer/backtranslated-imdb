This is the Australian television series. It's a classic. The stories and the actors are excellent. Who can forget about Picker and his gramophone or Chet being behind? This is cool tv. The Australian actors in the series were their best and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and the song are just amazing. The final credits that start with the tight wheel, so Keir sleeping n gets jostled around, and then the long shot just doesn't get much better than that. All 13 episodes are just as solid in the Australian myth's depiction, and I think that's what this series has. It doesn't matter that the two main characters were from abroad, I think that is the key to the series and why it's so good.
