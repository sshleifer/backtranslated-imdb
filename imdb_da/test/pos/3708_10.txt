Much about this movie was beautiful. The play, nature and no doubt showed Aaron's film history on the beautiful shots. Definitely worth looking at as your attention gets imprisoned all the time and it ends up with just the right tone. The actress of newcomer Jonathan Furr was great as one might think he was a tempting since he was born. He has gone on to perform in other feature films, but this main role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The movie has the accolade at times when it's slow and scenic and quiet, so it's not a movie that adds kids can sit through. But the rustic ambience of East Bend and Yadkinville played well as a 1940's film.
