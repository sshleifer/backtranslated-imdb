We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and turned off - not your usual Hollywood drive. My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed a number of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was going out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy - and with some errors in the DVD, we finally had to turn to the wide-screen version and then back to the full-screen version to stop it. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect at the role. And she can also sing! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood would learn from independent filmmakers! Maybe we would go back to the real movies. But for the moment we are sticking with off beat and really entertaining movies like this! Other examples we've had include: A box full of moonlight, pieces of April, delivering milo, Celestine prophecy. Most of Christopher Guest as: Best in Show, for your consideration, a mighty wind and waiting for Guffman
