This much less than a percentage (minimal fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the vast majority of people who fall into more than 99% of the population who are not studying or already have a solid knowledge of physics theories, including relativity, quantity, string and M theory. <br /> <br /> Which brilliant architectural documentary. Beginning with a slightly useful historical background, you will be guided step by step with elegant steps in a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I have always had a great understanding of mathematics. This movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language math is without making you feel like you're about to fail the character. <br /> <br /> The display is repeated as the original format was a mini-series spread over three shows.

We are all (and all around us) are vibrational energy with a natural tendency to harmony. This movie can blow up - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far greater than what we see around us (even with the Hubble telescope) and far less than the protons and neutrons in the atoms we learned about in Gymnasium.
