I got this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love To Schweiger. However, it is one of those movies that when you see it another time, you never say to yourself: "Hmm. I forgot this boring part. I want to make popcorn." It doesn't have that part. It is a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And yes, To Schweiger is worth it, if not otherwise. But it is a great movie for even guys.
