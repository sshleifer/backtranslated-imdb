Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) will be one of the cool girls in their high school. Uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them by using their cheating practice in an exam. Two of the cool boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) are asking them for their answers and they are all busted. After a bawling out of the principal (Bud Tingwell) they meet cool girls outside in the playground and confronted them with whether they "doubled" on them all. When Debbie and Sue didn't have the cool girls invited them to "dunnies" for a smoke. They then begin to hang out with them on the weekend at the beach and watch all the boys surf. Sue ends up with Danny and Debbie with Garry. A lot of common teenage actions take place, including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a possible overdose of heroin, which makes Debbie oppose inequalities in life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just seeing the boys. They are not happy, but see her and call names, and eventually Debbie mastered the board. A cool early 80's Aussie movie.
