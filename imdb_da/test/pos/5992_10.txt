Romuald et Juliette is one of the French romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules, rather than the Trop Belle Pour Toi. The beautiful Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to collide around his ears. The movie is not a preachy moral story, but a wonderful story that keeps you connected to the last. Firmine Richard (like Juliette) is a heroine that women will cheer on - her laughter is my memory of this hot and female movie. The earthly way she has to involve all her children of their different fathers - especially the birthday - gives the film an edge that lifts it over your average romantic comedy. But it is always the French who seem to show us how easy it is!
