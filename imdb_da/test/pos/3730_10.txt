Great film. Post-apocalyptic film kicks ass. This is no exception. Maintained the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (primarily through a good character development). The battle between Reno and the hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild humanity had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a little spacey, that is, I had difficulty understanding the distance between the hotel and the opening sequence. Overall, ass's character progression, design, history without pillow of dialogue, and most importantly, the ever-appreciated desolate scenery of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
