Too many Christian films are centered around the fear of judgment, and as a result, it is as discouraging and unknowingly cheesy. "Second glance" gets it right. This is an almost perfect evangelical tool; It's about the real reason why so many young people have nothing to do with Christianity. It ensures viewers that one must abandon their sin - not their fun - to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. "Second Glance" even works as a piece of film making. The filmmakers of course worked on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script that was dynamic enough to distract the viewers' attention from this obvious fact. This movie brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere showing it, it has surely affected more people than just me.
