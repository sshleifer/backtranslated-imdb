This movie is about three teenagers who have been best friends for the longest time, and are going on the most shocked journey in their lives. When Heroine becomes the drug of choice in their city, these three teenagers find themselves wrapped in everything. This movie depicts heroin dependence very well, and it is something you can't stop seeing. MTV has never been the best to make for television movies, but this one has very good content to not see it. I enjoyed this movie, in the beginning I thought it would be the worst movie I've seen, but then it got better and I couldn't turn away.
