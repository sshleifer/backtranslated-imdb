First and foremost, there is a detective story: "laggite défense" by the Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose "l'assassin habite au 21" Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair. for both movies. The 1942 movie was excellent, but since "Detective History" was held, why is it complaining? As for the "Quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. Having directed "le corbeau" and being blacklisted, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. Setageman essentially complained about the bad detective ending, which I will not reveal of course, but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes of his character's psychology, and he did not destroy the puzzle à la Agatha Christie. By doing so, he becomes the true predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admires greatly. Suzy Delair has a big screen presence and you will love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala". Bernard Blier always gives a sparse gesture and vocabulary, and he really draws .Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: she takes pictures of female models, and Clouzot, by subtle touches, shows us that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never pronounced (how could it be in 1947?) The chief of police (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells her, "You and me, we are not lucky with women." Portrait of this policeman is very detailed: we learn many things about him, not necessary associated with the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widow, with a son he loves, and who runs into school difficulties, especially in geometry. Then we learn all the characters in depth. One of the most important manifestations of French cinema after the war.
