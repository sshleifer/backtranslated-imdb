There was nothing else on TV yesterday afternoon, so I thought "okay, let's see this." I didn't know the plot, and I had no expectations whatsoever, I was thinking in a few minutes, or I'll channel the surf again. But then the story began to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two boys. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but in general it was a really good movie. Worth to see.
