I think the title of the film describes it well. If you are looking for a documentary about Louis Kahn and his work, you will have to look elsewhere. although some of them are covered by this film. Of course, I eat pretty much everything I am fed to, and I do not know much about the family history that is about this matter. so i thought what i was told about nathaniel and his dad etc <br /> <br /> for what this movie was, i thought it was pretty good. A little slow and grabbed for attention on time, I wish Nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (although much of the story was interesting, Louis was a bit of a player). <br /> <br /> This is truly a journey through the lives of others, and I was happy to feel the experience together. an educational experience for me, and it also seems to the film maker. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the footage of some of Kahn's work is * amazing *
