This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to CIA agent Henry Field's (Sutherland) description, seems to maimize women and children for the most part. At least that's what he says to blame US Naval Officer Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again) to take on the task of publishing as Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos, but mentally he is his antithesis. He is carried in order and Carlos is borne by chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all the shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. In his first half, Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos, and that's actually where the movie gets its distinction from other action flicks. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) participates in Fields in training Ramirez, and together they seem to take over the role of parents in the birth of Ramirez's new character. Ramirez is taught to dislike the things Carlos dislikes to act on the divisive spirit that Carlos wanted and even to love as Carlos (gratitude for Carlos's ex-boyfriend). Of course, everything he learns will be used in the last half of the movie. It's a little distinct, but Quinn gives a fast-paced performance like a Carlos-Wannabe. Another thing I liked about this movie was that it did not exploit the very exaggerated plot of evil twin films - you know it, the evil twin insinuating himself in the good twin family. Ramirez's family comes into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character destroys chaos on his family life. Good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, which often comes the acerbic duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. One exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?). Also overdone was the constant harp of the duo about how powerful and clever and intelligent Carlos is. In my opinion, the payout was not able to match the structure during the last showdown. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was fun. I'm not a big action flick fan, but this movie was more intelligent and spectacular than the average action movie, and it kept my attention all the way through. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
