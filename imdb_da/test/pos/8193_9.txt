The Emperor and Assassin (with English subtitles) of 161 minutes is long, but the time is full of a story that hardly fits into it. Golden Cave Palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscape background a true story of China's unifying king, about 300 BCE. An intricate plot with a myriad of twists is played with excellent shows of the cast. King Qin's simple desire for a united empire for his ordinary people is fulfilled, but not without treason, plots and contradictions and oh yes, organs. Lots of bodies. This epic story of China's beginnings is a great way for Westerners to look at little-known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacy includes the thousands of lifestyle terracotta figures still excavated today. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin was to be seen alongside George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name some of the world's greatest conquerors / statesmen. I highly recommend seeing the Emperor and Assassin, especially on the big screen.
