Anand is one of the low budget but well taken films. It's a "cup of coffee" entertainment, without violence, blood or "jumping out of your space" excitement that most telugu movies have. However, it has some masses of its own. Roopa is a huge and down to earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any kind of situation, even her fierce son-in-law for her. She even supports out of the wedding because her fiance does not stand up for her. But her air of trust and independence is enough to make Anand, a rich young gentleman living in the city, strive to be her new husband. The father kills her parents in a car accident anyway, so why not pay her back? But Roopa is not the kind that will fall into charming smile and polite behavior, she puts him through a lot of situations and continues to be rude and a pain. It is only before he stands up for her and saves his life that she understands that she also loves him. But complications follow?
