Fata Morgana is by far the most odd and most confusing film I've ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, although there are elements to document the images, the pictures are so unusual, so the hallucinogenic, so unclear that I wonder if it was really worth telling this story just because those pictures may exist. The film is basically the story of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from an outsider perspective, be it alien or something indescribable, all of which takes place in the Sahara desert. The title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images, both genuine and hallucinated, that people in the desert often witness. These are also known as mirages. The movie opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. With each plane landing shot, the actual architecture of both the location it lands on and the aircraft itself begin to slowly dissolve into each other and grow smaller and less real and increasingly reflective images. The picture in this movie grows only more intense and more unusual as the image continues. The story of the film tells about the creation of the universe, as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera. The shoots go further and further into the desert and Herzog movies, no matter what he sees and finds. The world's strangest reflections appear remotely, while Herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders you will ever see. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack kicks in, you can be sure that you are in the world of a sour man who is in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can't say too much more about this movie without destroying anything, but I'd say it's an enjoyable experience and there's really nothing like it. I love watching movies that are just in classes of their own. This film is definitely a good example of how Herzog loves to mix storytelling and documentary filmmaking into an interchangeable form. Fata Morgana is unfortunately not over, but it is just a little welcome, but with the time it is approaching, the end is likely to be burned in your mind forever. Absolutely a must-see for those who are obsessed with the nature and origin of the universe.
