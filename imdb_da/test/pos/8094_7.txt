Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda study, scary Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, Judge Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's speech series recognizes the frightening equality of the caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie came to a slow start with a typical Chaplin swing bar focusing on the Jewish barber's first adventurous adventure. I have never seen it before I have to admit that after the first 20 minutes or so, I wondered what all the fuss was about. But the film captures steam quickly. There are some very fun moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish character of "Hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the movie is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As much as Chaplin is in this movie, I thought it all was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni." Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant grinding pat. The scenes where Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate on the fate of Ã–sterlich had me in stitches. <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie and it was worth seeing.
