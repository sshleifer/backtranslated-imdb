A fun and critical criticism of the Russian society and culture during the transition from communism shows OKNO V PARIZH also the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (including Peter the Great's "window to the west") finds a magical portal that immediately transports them to Paris. Min's film is really fun, and just "odd" enough to keep even the combed movie viewer on his toes. The songs, the dream sequences and the deliciously obnoxious societies of both cultures interfere with creating a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone trying to understand the shift in Russian cultural feelings since the fall of the Soviet Union should begin here.
