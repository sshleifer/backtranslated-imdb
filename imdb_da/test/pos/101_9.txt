This is a very, very strange movie ... one that is so strange, it's best that you just see it yourself. The movie begins with a crowded professor who has messed up his class because the students have the unpleasantness to be not as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic - to find the value in almost nothing but to adhere to his own inner sense of self-meaning. In addition, he seems tired and sad about the monotony of life. Later in the film he goes into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. It is strange that this is only halfway through the film, and what followed was a very bizarre tale of his last life's seconds. It is here when the film becomes exciting, because the style of the story is like one of the literature professor's novels - one that is intelligently written and says things that we want, we all could say them. <br /> <br /> See this weird movie - it's incredibly compelling and not something I've ever seen before.
