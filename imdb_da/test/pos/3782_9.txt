Great Chaplin movie with many memorable moments when Charlie joins the army to fight in World War I. <br /> <br /> First, he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to queue. It's a really fun scene as the tramp isn't used to keeping your feet straight! <br /> <br /> Next, you know he's in France in a ditch. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie who eats the cheese from a mousetrap and reads a letter from home over someone else's shoulder. When Charlie goes to bed, he finds his piles all flooded and his roommate snoring. It's such a fun part! I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up'. It had me rolling on the floor when it turns out that his other leg still feels numb ... while Charlie actually rubs his room foot! <br /> <br /> The movie is so grim when Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his ditch (though it is done in a very fun way) and he personifies as a tree to get close to the enemy and rescue a friend His from a death group. a french girl in trouble hiding in her house. He must then save her, and at the same time he also takes the German kaiser. To do so, he imitates a German colonel or something. I love it when Charlie is asked something in German and he is like no one. The soldier looks at him in a fun way so that Charlie changes: yes yes yes! Kaiser gets caught, and Charlie is the hero ... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! Charlie did one of these 'dream sequences' before (The Bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so fun it had me laughing all the way. Chaplin also has something to say with this movie (since his later work became more of a social commentary on several mishaps in the world) and is best explained in the film's last sentence: 'Peace on earth, good will for all mankind. '<br /> In short: a Charlie classic, very fun, timeless. 10.9.
