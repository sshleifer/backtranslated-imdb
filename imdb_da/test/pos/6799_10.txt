It's a beautiful movie. The scenes are well depicted. Anne Reve's dialogues are very well written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives, and the things it teaches make it amazing and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is great in the movie and his role goes through many emotional turmoil as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks really nice, her scenes in the movie are inherently poetic, how the camera follows her and the way the music makes you feel, makes every scene of her ethereal beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie has great spirit and a beloved loved classic. Angela Lansbury is very funny in her role although it is not recognizable if you have seen her in the role of 'm' in the Manchurian candidate. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp has made his father's role full justice, and the manuscript gives him lots of things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice movie and a must for family and kids an evergreen Christmas favorite.
