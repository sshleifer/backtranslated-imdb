What can ever happen in a boring Texan city in the summer? Well, a bunch of teenagers find out that a few things can and should happen. It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing short of el chupacabra, and the film, unlike the name would suggest, is not a remake or lookalike of the American Werewolf movies, but something completely different. All in all, for a low budget film of course, it's not bad! Some wise camera work, pretty decent looking traditional creations and making effects, and not even all knowledgeable about people who can and are making mistakes, like shooting a colleague who thinks it's the big evil animal and is baffled of things they could not know. <br /> <br /> Sit down at this expectation of a million dollar production and you will turn it off in disgust after a short period of time. Sit down by this and wait a little bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and that's pretty good! All in all, I get an 8/10 from me to be creative, have to act and draw some good work for the budget this movie had.
