While reading all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I still had an interest in the preview. I don't know if it was because I expected a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I was not particularly afraid of until the second half of the movie, but even then it was not that bad at all. I think most scenes and false alarms were realistic if it was a bit too random, but it was necessary to move the story together. I believe that the house and the surrounding area are the perfect setting for this type of movie, it is beautiful and large, but then the same qualities that are attractive, are frightening. I also think that the lighting event worked extremely well because they didn't just settle for entry, but there was no way to keep them, so the house was dark outside the little section that Jill was in. <br /> <br /> Talking of Jill, I thought her part was acting pretty well, initially it wasn't that credible, but after a few phone calls it was fine. In fact, the scenes where she is scared are acting perfectly. And finally, some fireballs got right. I can't tell you how many times when I hear a noise in my house, I take the fireball and it was a good touch for her to do the same, though she idiotically forgets when she needs it most. /> <br /> Regarding the plot holes, the film is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how he entered. exactly how long did he look at her? How did he get out to kill his friend? and when exactly the gardener dies? Overall, I enjoyed it and I was surprised at how quickly it went. It kept my attention and I wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very short and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, except for the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes to her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more, to give us a taste of her personality and to give us a shadow of how she will handle the situation ( For example, the stage where she is debating going back to the kids, it seems that a scene is lacking at first, talking about her only caring for herself or something).
