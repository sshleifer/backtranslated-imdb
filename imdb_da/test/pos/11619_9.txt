First, this movie won't be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their very nature will extinguish many potential potential viewers. Of course, from the reviews on this forum - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those who have seen it. I am among those who liked it a lot for several different reasons. I feel that this was a very ambitious (and quite competent of ...) for a bunch of 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience. I think every aspect of the movie - the direction, the actor (though the character's performance more closely resembles the stage or free-form performance because of the film's character ...) production, FX, the score / sound design - all are far better than many movies, I've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten times. I have honestly not been so impressed with an "art house" style war film since Nacho Cerdas GENESIS ... First of all - I will not pretend to understand and / or understand all of the graphic content of this movie - but knowing this was not a just narrative type of movie when I went into it, I was not disappointed with how it played out. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY are 4 relatively short vignettes, all of which are about the right brain / left brain desire / anger / psychosis theory / restraint / compassion / "normalcy". Too brief to give an overview of each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically just has a naked girl who has an eye hair taken from her abdomen. I'm sure it's symbolic for something - I don't think I paid so much attention at that time, and this is blowing pretty fast. <br /> <br /> The next episode - MEN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrible, truly eerie story of a guy who is both in love with and repelled by his pregnant sister, giving her growing psychosis leading up to the shocking conclusion of that chapter. HUMAN LARVAE is the best of the pile in my book and will probably come under your skin. The dialog with dead-pan tells the growing excitement that you know something terrible will happen - but you're not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you are interested in watching this movie - do not do too much research on it. Get into it with an open mind and a ferocious stomach, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, especially with this episode. REBIRTH has a bunch of people in a field that screws the ground and blows trees and things. Apparently an "artificial" interpretation of rape on the ground or something of it. Not bad, but this is pretty short and I've missed the point on it ... <br /> <br /> And RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also with HUMAN LARVAE, some have the "hardest" pictures / messages of the entire feature ... OVARIAN EYEBALL is nothing to write home about, mainly because of the very short run, but makes a decent sigue in the disgrace that comes ... and REBIRTH is also a little short and not quite so thoughtful, but PEOPLE LARGE (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so out of the wall and well done that they more than make up for other parts. I think the main reason I liked this one so much is that, as "shocking", "disgusting", "violent" and "exaggerated" as it is, is also done very beautifully and you can say, that this was a real labor force of the people involved. Nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, and although the content is not completely decipherable, it is unthinkable original - and that alone is some point in my book. Not that any "strange art house" movie that has an incomprehensible plot must be praised for it's "originality", but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is the type of movie I think I will see a few times in the near future for to see what other interpretations I can get from it. Again, this movie is definitely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious images, etc ... destined to shock the viewer to take a harder look at this movie. I have to say that it worked for me and I am eagerly awaiting the Hussain / Cerda collaboration, which is rumored to be coming next time. Check this out if you have the stomach for it - 9.5 / 10
