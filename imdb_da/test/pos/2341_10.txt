A really accurate and honorable look at modern life. It could be set in any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a residential building in Glasgow and can relate very well to this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, situations and characters are far too realistic, but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are scarily credible, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate dip in the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a must see.
