This film was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war - probably in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreational battles and the peoples of the era who look pretty impressive and realistic. It also gives a different and more balanced view than just its contemporaries, BIRTH OF A NATION - a patented absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short movie would be great for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man running away to experience as a drummer. The boy does well and is a hero, even though the film ends quite melodramatically - a particular convention of the day. Not a good movie, but a decent plot, decent acting and a bit of the over-the-top play you so often in other movies of the day. <br /> <br /> An annoying aspect of this movie was the frequent use of title cards to describe or set the scene for things that were truly obvious. It became annoying from time to time.
