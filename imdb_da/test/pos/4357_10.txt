With documentary film, the issue of realism always grows up. How much of the movie is real and how much is being manipulated by the film maker? IN LITTLE DIETER YOU MUST FLY, Herzog is too absorbed in telling the story that a man tells his own story to take the issue of realism versus formalism himself. From the beginning, Herzog's role as a narrator is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master historian. LITTLE DIETER is the finest and most engaging documentary I've ever seen. Dieter's story is enchanting, and Herzog's efforts on re-recording that put Dieter through the steps to relive his story while being filmed are very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is always present, scary absurdist comment from realism. This film is a must-see for all documentaries and / or Werner Herzog students.
