Easily one of the best Indian movies ever. Granted, that doesn't say much (I made this conclusion after a huge 15 minute view). But I can really say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant movies I've seen. Beautiful because of his imagery. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads (Radha and Sita) and the characters with the same name in Hindu mythology. For example, Sita is the honorable Lord Ram's wife. As the legend goes, Ram undermines his wife by letting her go through a fire to prove her `purity '. Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reunited with her mother (Earth). This story has all kinds of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word `fire 'suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and even a few others I did not get. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of its social overtones. Many who were offended by the premise of this movie should actually be the first to see Fire (eg my mother who actually loved it). Why? Because even though fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, it's its strength, NOT its weakness. Traditional conservative social mores (whether Indian or Canadian or American or anything) are useless if they slave you. Gender roles and self-denial can both do this. <br /> <br /> These are the things I took with me after seeing fire. Hats off to Deepa Mehta ??
