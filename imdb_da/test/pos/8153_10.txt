If you have a box of tissue, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a Friday night, it's definitely your movie! It's romantic, it's hot and its challenging. For most of us gay people, religion is just one of the things we did when we were kids and probably just star on the alter boy and how sweet he was! But in the last few days, you see the struggles of being gay when your whole world is about faith, which completely contradicts being gay. The two main cast members were completely warm but managed to catch your heart and even make me almost "crying" (I never cried in a movie!), Which I thought was pretty impressive for a B grade movie. I highly recommend this flick, you will laugh, you will cry (unless your me) and you will definitely throw! I love it so much I bought the DVD myself for my collection. It's really the most beautiful movie ever
