Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I did not move slowly abroad, followed with constant industrial turmoil, the general worship of mediocrity - unless you are a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I missed The Dismissal along with many other Australian TV dramas from the 80s and 90s, such as the amazing Janus and Phoenix series, which I have since seen with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the dismissed story of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I know, exactly. But with regard to public "disgrace", it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were torn off the controversy. I know that my two brothers would not talk to me for months. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, however, the comment is very one-sided everywhere. The inevitable fact is that the Australian voters chose - and decided decisively - in favor of Fraser, as they did two years later, despite fierce rage from a significant part of society. <br /> <br /> This apart, a historically accurate and highly effective docudrama.
