a nice romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what was a grease for comedy he had. a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster himself. comedic writing on this movie is excellent. eleanor parks do a good job as the flight's former wife, who errol tries to win back. eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the sets radiate the glamor and style of the 1940s, where appropriate. <br /> <br /> The flight's comedic timing and whites are shown to full effect here, see his dual traits, his ability to verbally combat beats with a sneaky comeback or act the equal man, and his overall credibility and sincerity where it required, this guy could act! It's a shame that errol didn't get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was many talented to the utmost. if you enjoyed "it happened one night" with gable and jacket or some of william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Well paced and lots of laughs. a lost diamond of a movie.
