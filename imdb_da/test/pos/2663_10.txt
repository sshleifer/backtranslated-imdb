I am writing this review just after hearing about Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss, and I'm writing about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it's the complete Kubrick movie, the one he's most remembered for. It is a picture like no other that not only revolutionizes science fiction, but changes the way the films are conceptualized. It was probably American first art film and has inspired George Lucas and countless other writers and directors as well. <br /> <br /> Apart from its visual grandeur, the reason why the film plays so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-author, had a vision, but we have never really figured out what was through their minds. Of course, it is lean on its 'message', how the technology of the future will take over humanity and determine the course of our lives unless we are cautious. The end of 2001 is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star's airplane back to earth. It is meaningless for many, but discerning filmmakers understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 does not have the evil, dark humor in the DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contains strong, eccentric characters that filled his former works as PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would have been remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade at a time when Hollywood was still out boring musicals and just woke up to the new wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made amazing movies on his own terms, his own time and for everyone else to marvel. He will be missed.
