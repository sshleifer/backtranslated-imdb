I remember watching this movie back when it was released, and I still remember the "buzz" I felt when I left the cinema. Everything about this movie is magnificent! The music is top notch, and I still play the audio track after all these years. I've seen this movie so many times and yet I still yearn to see it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and when I see Cameron Dye in something today, I always attach him to this movie. It's too bad, the rest of the cast didn't go on to bigger things, but maybe it's part of this movie's charm. <br /> <br /> I don't want to make a film school criticism as I'm sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they want to, but what I want to say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later. The movie feels great and encourages emotions when you see it (well ... it did for me) and I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You either 'get' the movie or you don't! Those of you who 'get it' will be rewarded with a unique movie experience.
