Director John Schlesinger's tense and hectic film tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold US secret secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competently. He is a young man who is very disillusioned by the CIA's underhanded activities in Allied Australia. Sean Penn, the doped drug that runs Andrew Daulton Lee, is excellent. The competent and professional direction of Schlesinger along with some very good plays makes "Falcon and Snowman" a spying thriller not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
