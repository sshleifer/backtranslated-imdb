With all the shoot em up, blood horror movies that have come our way in the last few moments "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills Have Eyes" Yes, they have their place, don't make me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Why? Because it is a remake of the 1979 classic, which at that time was excellent and afraid you know what out of all! I didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie made of mood, atmosphere, excitement! Because remembering people you can't see what you think you see, what you can't hear, or what you think you hear is far more scary, so what you do! If you love movies with mood, creepiness, excitement and atmosphere !! You will love it! It brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember people, it's well done! not perfect! It's scary, not bloody, it's scary, not horrible! It was great to watch a movie for so long. Our minds have been conditioned and combed by the glitz and shock of modern horror movies, we forget what is really scary.
