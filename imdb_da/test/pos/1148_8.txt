<br /> <br /> Average adventure movie that took a serious story and "Holywoodised" it. Watering down the effect made especially against the average script moved away this movie place as one would be a solid classic. Why water down such a great story? Probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial issues, and producers do not want to create political warmth, just thank quick profits. The management, films and soundtracks and plays were good. The play was average. Connery's charm made up for his wrong Arabic accent, and all scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / sets here were very good. To bad we didn't get any more of a serious historical drama, as this is what history requires. Only for big fans of leading actors or fans of exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies .....
