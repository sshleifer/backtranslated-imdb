I remember watching this movie in the theater and liked it. I happened to stumble over it for fear net last month and saw it again and found it better with age. First and foremost, for those of you who describe this as 80's cheese, if you objectively compare it to the horror tabs of the last 2 decades, it compares quite well if it is stacked up against film in its unique horror subgenre as I would describe action / horror as opposed to psychological fears such as "The Shining" or "the exorcist". <br /> <br /> In addition to its budget, this movie really delivers the goods (or in this case bad). The film actually has some character development and gives enough of a story about the infamous hull to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. The movie also has several hilarious one liners and gives the right mood that an eerie horror flick should have. If you compare NOD with modern big budget horror movies like "I'm Legend" (The Vincent Price version was much better) this movie really plays. Modern horror flicks have been almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character development at all and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these films from start to finish, and the characters are 24k plastic. If this is 80's horror cheese, I take it over 95% of the current genre entries. <br /> <br /> On a final note NOD sees again that I remember the beautiful Jill Terashita and wonder why I haven't seen her in several movie horror or otherwise. Jill on the odd chance that you read this - I think you are beautiful and should have been in several movies. Finally, you'll probably like this one a lot if you like action horror flicks.
