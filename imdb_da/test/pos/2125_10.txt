I have a 4 year old daughter, and before this movie she turned to the Disney Princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie to all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that every mother would love to encourage that little girl. With the big songs and dance movements it gets my daughter up and tries to imitate the movements. The extras are also good, you even work with how good your memory is. I would certainly have said it is a must see for both children and adults.
