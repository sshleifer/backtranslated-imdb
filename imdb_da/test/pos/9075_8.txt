My mom always told me to sit down and actually watch this movie because it is one of her favorites, I never did for years until I caught a night on television. This movie was great, I don't even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast outstanding (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is amazing. It's freaky, but not too scary, and it makes you think. I was left speechless after this movie and amazed at how well actors and actress all five of these people really are. Where did William Baldwin go, he's great. This movie is a must see for everyone, if you haven't seen it, rent it, you won't be sorry. Amazing!
