I can't describe the feeling when I got this crappy VHS rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. Somehow I got my father to rent it for me, and I saw it twice with my little brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This movie was originally classified as PG in the United States, in many other countries, including Finland, it was limited to 18 or 16. The movie was aimed at teenagers, but this must be the most magnificent PG-rated movie ever. There is no bad language or nudity in what ever. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for a few years before its release. <br /> <br /> This is an A-Class B movie, a real, well-crafted 80's horror flick. A bunch of college girls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum, without knowing that a supernatural evil awaits ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotting meat and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's campy, totally stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore. There is certainly some sense of this 80's scare genre. This is still effectively scary and entertaining after all these years. The effects are just oozing quality by Ellis Burman Jr. and Thomas R. Burman. The makeup effects play a major role in this flick, otherwise it would have been just a boring teenager. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD and it is a Special Edition DVD, including some extras. Comments are interesting. <br /> <br /> (In fact, this version is not that special. Under average transfer on DVD, some glitches and scratches here and there) Initially it was released by the blue underground, but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show launched it without restoring the print. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great date movies! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
