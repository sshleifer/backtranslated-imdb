Thank you for the Internet Movie Database !!! When I first got this movie, I saw it every night just before bed and got something different from it every time. But no matter how I splashed it, it came up to disturb. The black and white and all the shakes really freaked me out. You are staring at the screen uncertain of what you are looking at, and just when you think you have it, it becomes clear and it is something completely different. The picture quality is very disturbing, features and straight razors are not good with me in any movie. Still every time I looked at it, I interpreted it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue you know), so I decided to check IMdB for the plot collection. Boy throwing me for a loop, I didn't know it should be God. Now I have to see it with that in mind and see what happens ....
