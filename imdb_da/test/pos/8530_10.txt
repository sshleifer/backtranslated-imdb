Well, first of all - I'm a big fanatic of horror movies, but still - I'm pretty sick of all the horrible American horror movies. They are about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, it's not wrong with the blood and all that - don't even disturb me - but it doesn't make a movie crazy! That's why I find this movie entertaining - it's fun to see a satire that makes fun with the concept "main horror USA". American splatter / gore movies, they do not suppose to be scary, just funny. It is OK. But when they suppose to be "creepy", it becomes most pathetic. There are, however, a few major American horror films (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it is the same. Therefore, this film came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! I can't wait until master leader Anders Jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie! Until I have to see Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I don't care - it's such an excellent movie!
