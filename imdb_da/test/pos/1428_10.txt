I saw this mini-movie when the first aired and loved it! It is fun to see how far people will go for money. It is also fun to see how much a girlfriend can be "whipped". "Whipped" enough to kill. I think the casting was great, especially the character Kristin. Without it being easy to talk and misleading, the film would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I never use to see the United States, but now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
