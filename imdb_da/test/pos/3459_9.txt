This is by far one of the best movies I've seen for a very long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than I have since the Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you're looking for a touching movie without the twisted edge ... this is it. It is genuine and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was first reluctant and I only looked at it because I had to do a school project on speech disorder. But this movie is so much more than that. It is about life, free and independent of the way the world would have kept you. Its about the disabilities we all have, keep us from seeing ourselves and what we miss, but let everything else get in the way.
