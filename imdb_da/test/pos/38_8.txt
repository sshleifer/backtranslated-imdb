S. Epatha Merkerson shines like Nanny in this moving and lively look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) as she grows up during the guard of Nanny. The film provides a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic manner as opposed to so many memoirs made for film. Supportive shocks add a lot of spark and many recognizable faces occur in minor roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig. Lose some steam and vibrancy towards the end, and the end of the sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But overall, a great movie with a truly outstanding achievement by Merkerson.
