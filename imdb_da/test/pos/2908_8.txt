This Fox play was a big hit when it was released in 1954. It is sumptuously created, with great music and set, exciting cast, it goes slow but interesting. Edmund Purdom is strikingly beautiful as an Egyptian who becomes a famous doctor and juggles three amazing women: a henchman Jean Simmons who passively allows him, the tempter Bella Darvi, who expels him, and a pharoah's sister Gene Tieney, who wants him as HERE pharoah. The movie's popularity has not fallen since it was shown again on AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is particularly great, his character seems to hit the women and never end up married and a "thinker". Darvi is amazing and tantalizing in his femme fatal role. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, Peter Ustinov co-star. Check it out.
