I watched this television version of a Christie mystery story when it was shown back on Channel 5 in New York City in 1980. At that time, I was surprised it was not shown on Channel 13, the public television station that showed most of masterpiece theater programs, however (except for some Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" stores and MOONSTONE), BBC productions rarely dealt with British detective stories. Another series, SHERLOCK HOLMES RIVER had dealt with stories set in the Victorian and Edwardian period, so a charm was involved in getting those stories on Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The Reason Why Did They Don't Ask EVANS? dealing with a young couple stumbling on a dying man who is the only last word is the question of history's title (the novel was originally called WHY NOT, AS THE FRENCH?), but was later resumed THE BOOMERANG CLUE. The young couple begin to investigate the murder and trace the crime to a set of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite warnings from the hero (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation - though it becomes milder and more dangerous. Another death of suicide by suicide increases the apparent dangers when the killer begins to look at the two amateur detectives. It's not a bad movie, although I agree that it was a little too long for a single night of entertainment (if it had happened that later Miss Marple episodes with Joan Hickson or the episodes Hercule Poirot in two, it would have been better). But it has strengths. One is the right use of Porter as the main suspicion and a smart scene later in the movie, where he seems to be spied on the young couple who is investigating the mystery. If you stick to the movie, you'll come to a reasonable surprise later. <br /> <br /> But it has an error. When dealing with a Christie novel, the figures in the story must be in a rigid motion plan so that the reader may find out what the plot's secret is. I will only add it if you hear the dialogue at a time and how a little boy was almost killed (but not) then you will find all the parts of the story that come together and what the villain's motivations were. <apart from that and the long time the phone takes to tell its story, it's a good movie and worthy as one of the best programs based on a Christie story during the time when they were sudden renaissance in film based on her novels.
