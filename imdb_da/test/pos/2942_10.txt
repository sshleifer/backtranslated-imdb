I watched this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It's so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerk! I was still thinking about the story days after I watched the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families are going through, that's something someone can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your girlfriend, will all really enjoy it! : D It's a real story about a real family who would pull on someone's heartbeat. Not to mention, beautiful landscape shots and great plays. Look, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did!
