The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite in the series. A vibrant visual appearance, an excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice casting all create an unforgettable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> Graphically, the game is definitely not a disappointment. Although some corners have been cut, it reminds everywhere in the game of Disney Feature Length Animations. The game is simple and even a beginner will get it fast enough. The game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its Mega Monkey Mode. <br /> <br /> Stemcast is one of my favorites. Dominic Armato's sympathetic voice makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes for a wonderfully scary, yet top-top villain, LeChuck. The game's charm is also added by memorable characters such as Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, Scrooge McDuck's voice). My hat also goes to the late, big Kay Kuter and his memorable secondary role as the Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once again enjoys the Monkey Island adventure, which features some of the best tunes in the company. The game is not perfect and some sites are not as detailed as others, but I had no grip on the simple ending of the game, which I found very satisfying.
