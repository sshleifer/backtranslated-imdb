Looking at this PPV, I had high expectations for it, as Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last before Wrestlemania. FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A 6 MAN TAKE TEAM MATCH Good way to start the fight. It started a little slow at first, but later the pace became faster and the battle became more exciting and entertaining. Benoit rolls through and makes Joey Mercury win a win for Hardy Boys & himself. 6/10 <br /> OTHER MATCH- GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATIONAL MATCH FOR WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a huge fan of Cruiserweights, and I'm never disappointed to see them, especially in this battle here. Chavo Guerrero nails Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy fight, despite not being a clear wrestling contest, it was still entertained me with the fun antics. Finlay nails the little Boogeyman with Shillaegh to win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV and does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH-KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out to be a really competitive wrestling competition. Hats off for both men, pulling a very entertaining game. Kane wins after a Chokeslam at King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTE MATCH-PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not so much of a good fight, Deuce & Domino need more training to fight, and London & Kendrick are the only ones to keep this fight fast. London & Kendrick keep their titles after Kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the boys to victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH-BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. SIR. KENNEDY FOR ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy is attacking Lashley from behind, before the match starts. It was an okay fight, but not really good. Lashley & Kennedy have some chemistry but not enough to draw a good fight. Kennedy wins the DQ after Lashley nails him with a chair and attacks him with the chair all the way to the entrance. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> SEVENTH MATCH-JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & SUBJECTS This is probably the biggest tag team match I've ever seen. Hats off to all these men {yes even Batista} to pull as close as a 5 star main event classic. All 4 of these men played their parts in the match very well, as this was a very large and entertaining team of fighters. Batista turns his back on the Undertaker spine and breaks him, then leaves the ring asking Michaels to stitch Sweet Chin Music, so Cena must nail an F-U to the hard-won victory. 7/10 <br /> I don't know why everyone says this PPV isn't good enough or it's boring, I just don't understand. It's a great PPV that Smackdown always delivers. A great PPV really. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give it 8/10 and a B +
