Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Although it fails to provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (depicting Karen) was not a good choice. She is a good actress, but plays a very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. A person with a stronger personality. Louise Fletcher's role as Agnes Carpenter is fantastic, she does a good job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> It has good songs that could be included in an audio album. Unfortunately, they were not, even though this film was on top of ratings in the US and other countries
