From a clean description of TOLL GATE's large plate elements, one might think it is a revisionist western from the 60s or 70s. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a robber, killer and arsonist; <br /> <br /> * The love interest is a single mother whose change-over husband left her and their child; <br /> <br /> * Twice our criminals are completely "unofficially" released by the authorities as opposed to some good deeds, and this is presented as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * The only actions presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one's family and the betrayal of a criminal union; <br /> <br /> * The hero tries to go straight, but returns to a crime scene after he can't get a job; <br /> <br /> * The hero is fleeing from both a sheriff's pose and a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * The hero's final redemption is achieved by stifling a man with his bare hands and throwing his body over a rock; <br /> <br /> * and the "good bad man" ends the movie by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding alone in the Mexican desert, never (presumably) paying for his crime life. <br /> <br /> Just go to show you there's nothing new under the sun. Of course, TOLL GATE does not entirely show the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors: The hero's redemption is created when he surrenders to the possen after reading a passage from the Bible. Can't quite imagine that Clint Eastwood did it. <br /> <br /> The TOLL GATE was an outstanding movie of any standard, and Hart was a very fine actor who was not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotions in the days before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
