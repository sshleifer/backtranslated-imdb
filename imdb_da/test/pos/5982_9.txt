An amazingly appalling statement for two soldiers in World War II. Faced with a frosty background of not only the fight against the Nazis and the traitors in Belarus, but the hard natural elements, this film tells a tale of two soldiers of polarized morality, one who survives, but finds it impossible to handle his own circumstances, and one Who dies, has done all that can be done in the light of intimidation and everything possible to break a spirit, in fact the title "author". A movie that should be seen by everyone, especially for the protagonists' phenomenal performances and appalling sets of pieces (especially imprisonment and hanging scenes. An absolute must see.
