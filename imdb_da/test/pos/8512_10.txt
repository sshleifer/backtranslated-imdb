People criticize NSNA because it is a low point in Bondgud Sean Connery's career and because it is unofficial. *** CAN INCLUDE SPOILERS * First of all, this movie is better than any other movie with other actors than Connery, all underpants wannabes in my book. Sean Connery is the only true Bond, no one comes close to his toughness, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career, but it's still the best-defined band movie from the 80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at an older age. He didn't become a baggy mess like Moore, but kept his good looks and toughness, but got some gray hair. So what? hes still the only real 007, and he's as tough and tough as ever. Sean Connery is the only and only 007. And this movie is definitely worth watching, no matter what anyone says. No gun barrel opening, but you can't have everything, can you? amazing theme song, however.
