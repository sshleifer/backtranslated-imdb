If I assume you know what this movie is about, I am also forced to assume that you have come to this review, knowing that you will probably see it no matter what I say. If all these rings are right - read on - you'll probably find something consistent with at least part of this review. If you are unsure or not at all sure what happened in the late 70s and early 80s in urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the reviews that claim to be objective instead. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I ever lived in. At the height of hardcore, I was immersed in from around 1979-1981 everyone had a band and Only common denominations between bands and actually members of their audience were: <br /> <br /> * Rejection of consistency <br /> <br /> * Tolerance and enjoyment of difference <br /> <br /> * a desire having fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, aversion to authority figures and violent mud dancing were not integrated into what I experienced, although there were probably clients or factions that used to be intolerant of those who did not dress, talk or act "punk" enough. And there was often a certain amount of uninterrupted credit extended from some of these clients to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascist paradigm of anarchist, self-defeating, evil young cophaters. <br /> <br /> Although the interview with the audience points in Penelope Spheeris' excellent Cal-Punk documentary film "Decline of Western Civilization" presents a very narrow picture of the subculture some of us have had, interviews with the bands, club owners , promoters and even security workers are much more representative of at least my own perspective and reminiscent of the 'scene'. Nevertheless, it is possible for those approaching this, with prejudices about what punk is to experience this movie without having their preceptions challenged. Unfortunate as this is due to the blame only those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not the filmmakers. Don't blame messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone - even most. It's not the most raw materials out there, but it's high, uncomfortable, fast and less worried about engineering than with raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me it was time to see the black black flag with Ron Reye's song, X, Fear and Circle Jerks worth far more than the price of this hard-to-get movie. As much as I think about The Germs when I saw Darby Crash for the show - and the good guy - that he was leaving me a little cold. Nevertheless, Darby's scenes played with his pet's tarantula, while "Shut Down" was lingering back and forth in the background were valuable. The X interview is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Spheeris' fair documentary style is complemented by wild boars and zooming under the musical segments. During interviews, the frame profile is used very nicely to create context for what is being said. Considering her experience and budget, Spheeris could have virtually anybody with this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this movie really is about and for those who have forgotten the few years of fun, honest, directional rebellion before Amaerican punk was bought for another flow in the mainstream musical, and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.
