I am a college student, and I bought this film at a used bookstore because it sounded really fun from the back description. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the funniest movie ever made! <br /> <br /> It is especially good to see if you are an atheist like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christian people are. They seem to believe that non-believers would like to live in really obnoxious, messy houses and nothing but drink beer and be mediocre to the neighbors. It's a LOW RIOT! My friends and I see it every couple of weeks so we can be entertained beyond our wildest imagination! Watch movies now! <br /> <br /> Let's hope Rich Christiano makes some of these movies entertain us pagans!
