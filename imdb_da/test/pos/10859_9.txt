It is surprising that a production like this is made these days, especially for television. Given the strong sexual themes and explicitly loved scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has provided a fantastic treatment and direction. The sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are sympathetic. There is a lot of humor, but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. Also this production avoids the mistake most movies / shows do when dealing with homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems like giving people the chance to be comfortable watching gays and lesbians on television and movies, most shows fill it with clich√©s and make the characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with this. In Tipping the Velvet, the main character is hardly aware of what is lesbian means! The BBC has made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of expertise on all fronts.
