I loved this. It starts out as a fairly normal, somewhat overwhelming French art film and then suddenly halfway through it is turned on its head. This part is brilliant when you realize that you have seen 2 suddenly not one. Unfortunately, the end does not make much sense, which is a great shame. Oh yes, and it's great filmed.
