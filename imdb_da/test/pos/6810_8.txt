I watched this movie in 1997 because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo saw his best in this movie, mainly because of his hairstyle and preppy wardrobe that was flattering to him. <br /> <br /> As the plot progressed, I realized that the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to watch a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and law enforcement tried to investigate the ring and bring the members to court. There was enough excitement and I think the violence was needed to relate the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I was shocked to learn the movie is the true account of horrible murders that occurred in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his leading lady exhibited real FBI agents who solved many young women's disappearances and contributed to the ring's perception. I think the movie is worth it as it informs the public about the dangers and opportunities of the criminal element.
