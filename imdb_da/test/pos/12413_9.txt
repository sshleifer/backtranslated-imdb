I know that Chill Wills usually played lovable old varieties in western. But his role in this segment is something I have remembered for a long time. Wills could be a first-class villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's fall was correct! It looks in Hepplewhite's eyes! It expressed grin greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence at once. Quite a performance, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Can the little black bag not cure alcoholism? I think it did sort of with Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to use cure if he had it as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite. <br /> <br /> There is a moment that was annoying but also needed. And it seems to come back in these Night Gallery segments. It is Serling's constant need to preach. Because that's what we got once again with Dr. Fall. I don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not stopping. Fall from preaching the bag's benefit to mankind, while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud and just asking for Hepplewhite to knock him out. But as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not have been able to see Will's performance discussed above. Everything is done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
