I had never seen the original death wish in the book, either Death Wish I (movie). But Death Wish 3 was the very interested movie. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend Charlie, but he only visited him a few minutes before he died because Charlie did not pay the protection for the huge and infamous underground gang led by Manny Franker. After some repression in his prison period, Kersey learned that Franker, whom he fought with in prison, had his own agenda to turn New York City into hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to put crime every time, everywhere. and everyday life. Because of the chance Insp. Richard Shriker who knows his profile well and likes him a lot. Kersey decided to put the war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action movies I had seen from the past. This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. No overwhelming storytelling and less unnecessary scenes that were the one merit of the movie. In the next issue, violence was used pervasively in the film. I thought many of the viewers liked Death Wish III's action scene because it showed the raw, extreme and exciting action for every minute of the movie, especially the movie's climax scene and the death of Manny Franker, which I thought was the maximum action scene . <br /> <br /> For the role, I think everyone was good and review their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe that he is still great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the "big old cat", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His biggest scrub in the movie made him look uncomfortable and resembled the big bad guy. However, Kathryn Davis's role in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought she was only two or three scenes before she was killed by Franker and his supporter to make the heat on Paul Kersey. She could have more role to see. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action movie fans. Quickly back and forth, this movie was very interested in seeing. Nevertheless, this movie had some stupid scenes and some plot holes. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker confronted Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny, because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it looks like you punch some guy before trying to lend him some money. Haha! It's like a joke! Although I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was later shown that he helped Kersey because Shriker initially looked like the villain much because of his action for Kersey, but when the film went to climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the film's final scene put me back. It stumbled upon everyone's feeling because it ended too easily. Frank's gang members looked incredible after finding out that Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other supporters decided to flee. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out of his city before the police caught him. I thought this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Films movies, but I don't like it. <br /> <br /> For the summary, I'm ok with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation, I wrote first. Thrown, and the action was very good and so extreme, though it had a scene I didn't like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence may be the best short description of this movie.
