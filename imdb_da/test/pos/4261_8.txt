Putney Swope is the story of a token black man on the board of a large advertising agency who has accidentally voted for the chairman when the owner of the company topples over while trying to get an idea that he was apparently very excited about . Putney obviously takes his new role to heart and burns most everyone in the agency, hires a new crew (all black except a token white guy) and continues to twist the most offensive and non-PC advertising you could ever ask for. Now it's a pretty modley crew he has, and despite being somehow successful in raking in cash. I like the scene where potential advertisers are relieved of banknotes and then asked to "come out". And their advertisements will follow later as them or not. The story is good, but of course the highlight here is the ugly advertising itself, especially the one for "Face Off" acne cream. This is quite dated but still a fun movie and full of fun moments. Robert Downey Sr. worked for an advertising agency that did experimental ads at that time, and I suppose this was his middle finger for Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and pretty damn fun. 8 out of 10
