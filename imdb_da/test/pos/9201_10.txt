This show is amazing! I love all the actors! It has great story lines and characters. It's the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. They both can be really fun. I miss the Vanessa Marcil at General Hospital, but she's amazing here. James Lesure is amazing! He can be fun. Molly Sims plays a dimwit very well. Scripture is amazing! They keep an excellent pace. The show can really let you down, which is one of my favorite features of a show. I can't wait for the new season to begin. This show makes it the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show stays for a really long time. If people know what is good, it will. I will never end the show. Ever.
