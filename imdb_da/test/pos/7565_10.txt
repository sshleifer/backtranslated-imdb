Behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy coming out of the train. He comes from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he hasn't seen in a decade. At the railway station we meet the man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> So, we begin our journey to "Four Friends", Arthur's powerful and amazing movie. You can ask why I started my review that way. Well, that's the way the video box describes the movie. You may have figured out that the movie will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this numb man, and ultimately he will peel on the deck and postpone kindness. Well, if you bought it, I have a bridge, I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would make that movie. Penn has always been an outsider and never resort to typically cliched storytelling. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and the undervalued "Mickey One") and "Fire Friends" are no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie will focus on the boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script only focuses on it for approx. 4 minutes and then surrender him. We meet the adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (who you may recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The film takes us throughout the 60's. Now in a smaller movie, the events will get the attention. But in "Four Friends" these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more concerned with character studies than plot, and I think the movie is better that way. We know the events; we don't have to stay on them again. <br /> <br /> I know I haven't described much of the plot, but I don't know if you can describe "Four Friends". It is not one of the "high concept" films that can be described in a single sentence. It is a film with many moods and textures. It is also a true emotional experience. The last 20 minutes of this movie moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a movie have such power that it can reduce me to tears. The action is the first time, especially by Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the most under-utilized actors working today. This is such a difficult, emotional performance, and Wasson pulls it out. He should have received an Oscar for this. Another great achievement is by Jodi Thelen, who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it extremely well and gives Georgia some dignity, which most Hollywood actresses would not (they would be too scared to even try, they would be more concerned with the image than giving a good performance, it's not about to trade). She also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four friends" did not receive much of a print in 1981. Perhaps people just do not have the emotional capacity to handle it. And clueless leaders couldn't push it like another "American graffiti" (it lacks the wallop of "four friends"). So they let it die. Too bad, because this is one of the very best films in the 1980s, a decade where more and more smoothly the trash was created, and great art like this was without home. I ask you to give this movie a chance. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
