A good x evil movie with the taste of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet" and maybe even "Star Wars". The evil counter Von Bruno receives an English gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. Elga, the beautiful simple and well-meaning lady who was forced to marry the counter, gives the love triangle. The count lacks an eye pointing to a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the counter thinks and is a terrible treat for him. There is also the terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even the appearance of some torture instruments. Boris Karlloff, here in a support role, makes a strong but slightly stiff presence. The other actors (and directions) are the symbol of an era of strong black and white film representations. Since the beginning there is no doubt who is the evil guy, who is the good. Even traitors and founders can be identified easily.
