"Piano teacher" is about Huppert's character; a medieval classic piano instructor with a stoic facade behind who lurks a highly compelling deviant personality. Unsatisfactory as a story, but exciting as a character study follows the film Huppert's character through her afflicted relationship with a student who delivers outstanding performances in the process. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" will play best with those in foreign films and character-driven dramas dealing with dark problems. (ONE-)
