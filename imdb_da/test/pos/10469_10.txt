The food always makes a good item in movies, as "Chocolat" showed. "Babette's Feast" is the same type of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who flies his home country after the repression of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish village. People in this village simply do not need joy. That is until Babette boils them one of her exquisite meals. It's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood films in general), it turns out that a movie can keep your interest without the use of explosions, car gates, etc. This is a movie you can't afford to miss. <Br /> <br /> One more thing. Do you think the Danish word for "party" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
