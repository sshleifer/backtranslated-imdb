I taped this on Sundance and had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another Kung Fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the dance player <br /> <br /> <br /> that sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew it had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the initial credits and had to wait until the end of the closing credits to see Miike's credits. <br /> <br /> So far he hasn't disappointed me yet. Audition, The City of Lost Souls, Ichi Killer and the Happiness of Catacombs were all good flicks, and now I have found that this was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> Other than Miike and Todd Solendz, no one is making interesting movies today.
