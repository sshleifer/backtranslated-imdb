I never read Sarah Waters book. Although I haven't read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. It begins with an interesting story with a twisted end. I must say that these 2 actresses are amazing. Sally Hawkins is amazingly successfully exhibited in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. Their romance is flourishing slowly as they spend more and more time together. The love-making scene is very tender and emotional, well-acted. The end is quite exciting, and these 2 ended up after all they've been through, which is a blessing. All in all, it's a great movie to watch, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.
