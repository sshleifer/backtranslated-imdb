Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her struggle is unusual. Gerda becomes a strong loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poison of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight as Gerda for the only one, for the love of my life for Mr Right. Patience is one of the key words in this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I want it to end soon ... Snowqueen tells about my life, I identify deeply with the story and the characters. Many thanks for Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
