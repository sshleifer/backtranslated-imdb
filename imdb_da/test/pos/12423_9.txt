Great horror comedy from Michael Davis. I laugh so hard, I almost down! Great acting from Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day and excellent performance of Jack Black-esquire as a performance by Justin Urich. He was just divine in this movie. This guy deserves to be a big star. Also, Aimee Brooks was good at the movie as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a murderer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. Gore to was given in abundance & I loved it. I just hope they release a non-rated version. Great Low Budget Horror Comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely fun! ***** out of *****
