This is a truly wonderful love story. I liked the songs, but even if you don't, you must love the story. Peter O'Toole is the best and Petula Clark does fine too. I saw the first one when I was about 13 and loved it then. Now in my eighties I still enjoy it, probably even more. Let me still cry and laugh and feel good. It's a movie to watch only at a new age guy or by yourself, as it's a chick flick. But what's wrong with that. Need some romance and maybe a little crying, try this movie. <br /> <br />
