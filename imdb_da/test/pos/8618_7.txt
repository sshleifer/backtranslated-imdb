Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke his audience. She takes us together to see how a movie is made on the spot. The movie in production seems to be based on itself, as the person in the center of history is Jeanne, a woman's director, like Mrs Breillat. Jeanne seems like the actual director's alter ego. <br /> <br /> Jeanne reached a death at the start of the movie. Not only has she chosen the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold, as it involves beach resorts that are of course too cold for the actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially the male leader who has difficulty accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the film; The leading actress is also no angel. <br /> <br /> Film production, Mrs Breillat tells us, is a process like no other in a creative work of art. Firstly, there is the written period, where in this case Jeanne, has written a play that when in production reveals problems that the author / director did not think of. There is the problem of how to photograph a love scene where the young woman in history has her first sex contact. What seemed wise on the written side does not necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has many problems accepting that a makeup should touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> The bright Anne Parillaud is amazing as Jeanne, the director. She makes observations about the production, the actors and the crew that fit well into the story being told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play leading players, with all the uncertainty that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne has to massage their ego to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. "Sex is Comedy" allows Ms Breillet to give us his own film recordings in general. This is a good look at the way movies are made in a typical Breillat style.
