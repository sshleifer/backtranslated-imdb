To my eternal shame I have never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire films, "Nosferatu". But if they show half of the creativity and pure joy of this effort by Buster Keaton, then I will probably try to see some more. This is really fun as well as being a great introduction to the world of silent comedies. The principle, as it is, focuses on an unfortunate case of erroneous identity, as Keaton fails the famous bad Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a series of hunting and flushes as the authorities get closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You'll be amazed and entertained in equal opportunities. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also a successful stuntman judging by the way he jumps and jumps around like Jackie Chan at speed. And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my better half had to interrupt a phone call to the parents because she was laughing too much! If you've never experienced a silent movie like this, it's nothing less than a revelation to see - it probably blew some ideas I might have had about silent movies. Of course, it's not as polished as today's movie - the play is pretty terrible, the truth is told, but it doesn't matter because you enjoy the movie regardless. Anyone with a passing interest in movies generally should make an effort to see this because they are not disappointed. Brilliant!
