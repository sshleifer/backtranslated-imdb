It is a mistake to refer to any movie in this era as a horror movie. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror movie as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of the early German romanticists such as E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921) dead personified takes a young man away from his treasure, but in Lang's film the fate of the character cannot be mitigated by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but they are determined by circumstances that only need to be reunited in death. However, in Victor Seastrom's "cork", repentance is always an option. Fate can be changed - and death is postponed - through the character's choice. Although scenes from Phantom Carriage, which collect souls, are truly eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great planner are compromised by Death's worship to the true monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, due to a perverted hatred to mankind spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes into contact with. <br /> <br /> A New Year's Eve Holm is knocked down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on midnight beats, Holm must become the leader of Phantom Carriage and gather souls during the new year. Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on his way to destroy, come for his soul and take him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment with the film's end is a criticism of the Selma Lagerl√∂f novel, where the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his destiny and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and himself and seeing that Holm suffers from the consequences of His sins are being made to collect their souls. It would have been an appropriate punishment and horror more enormous than experiencing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unchanging nature of fate is not the message; redemption is. The driver of the wagon allows Holm's spirit to return to his body, and he saves his family in time. His repentance tastes of Scrooge's repentance in "A Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> If the trite and sentimental end do not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are amazing when measured by today's standards and still stop, which is more miraculous when one finds that these double exposures were created inside a handcuffed camera. Also the restored movie on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.
