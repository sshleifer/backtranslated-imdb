Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Herman Melvilles' Pierre; or, the ambiguities ". The comments here surprise me, it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelming negative reaction. <br /> <br /> The shock value is the least appealing thing about this movie - a minor detail That has been blown out of proportion. The story is about Pierre's demise - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - apparently demonstrated in his traits, behaviors and idiots. The dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from anyone else I've seen and transforms a fundamentally traditional story with controversial twists into an unforgettable emotional epic, I can't stress the importance of disregarding everything you've heard about this movie and so, as I did, with an open mind. will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way as I was.I felt on the edge and nervous from about half an hour marking, but the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. l leave you with 1,000 thoughts, each of them immediately cumbersome and exciting. I know I shudder here, but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this movie. It's the best I've seen all year.
