Excellent silent version of Francois Villon's story. Although restored in the thirties as IF I WERE KING, with Frank Lloyd directing, Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the comic book and the wine-pressed Villon with a colonel that Colman couldn't match. The photograph is striking in its beauty and innovation and it supports, especially Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and the supporting comics Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal every scene they are in. <br /> <br / > It's a shame that Barrymore did so few first-class comedies. Among his sound films, only his lead in the TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared to this, and they only stand up because of his amazing voice. In this silent movie, Barrymore will tell his story without the benefit of words, and he does it, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the deaf king and loving like villon in love. He even jumps around in Fairbanks swashbuckling style, most convincing. He also lets his support cast their share of glory, cutting into this ensemble work as a potentially talented cartoon. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief word on Alan Crosland, a director known only today to manage the first talking function, The JAZZ SINGER in the same year, this was released. Crosland was a careful, innovative, lovely original instructor, and it is a pity that many of his works are not known. Perhaps this film, much more interesting as a movie than his most famous work, is your introduction to his other talents. If so, you can do much worse.
