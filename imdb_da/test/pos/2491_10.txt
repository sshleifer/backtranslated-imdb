To think that this film was made the year I was born. Believing that people still have their constitutional rights removed, now called "home security". To think that this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political sharing in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more broadly, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause a dissolver. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides. It causes you to face the question: Are you for people's right to disagreement in wartime or for the constitutional compromise in the name of "national security"? The protagonists are forced by the government to drive to the American flag in a game that undermines the ideals that flags stand for. The action is quite convincing. So much, I can't see any acting going on here at all. If this is a scripted documentary, it is more compelling than any reality show on TV today. PUNISHMENT PARK may be the most important movie ever made. It makes you think.
