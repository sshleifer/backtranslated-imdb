Don't be fooled: this is not yet a tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the French naval team coming to the ground to collect as much seed as possible genre, although the synopsis might suggest otherwise. This movie is a gem, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment I laid eyes on it. Hilarious, exciting, action-packed and amazingly erotic, "Ach jodel mir noch einen" is a Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, a grossly undervalued Bavarian classic. Stop everything you do and run out to rent, or even better, buy this movie right away.
