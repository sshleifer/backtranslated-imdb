When I was told about this movie, I wasn't so happy to see it, but at the end credits turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> the movie itself is pretty graphic (male to male scenes, you can't see it all) would not be a gay theme movie if there wasn't ... the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains a lot of fun parts. I highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters through you really feel like the main characters, and this I think brings the whole girl together. <br /> <br /> again, very nicely composed .. plus sweet Mormon.
