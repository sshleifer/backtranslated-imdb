Kevin Tenney's "Night of the Demons" is an enjoyable horror movie reminding me of "The Evil Dead". At Hallowen night, a group of teenagers throw a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town. Head of Angela, they perform a seance-like ceremony and unexpectedly awaken the evil spirits who are in the place. One of them possesses the uninvited evil force of teens, making them bloodthirsty demons. "The Night of Judgment" is a perfect horror movie. It is scary, crooked and beautifully atmospheric. The characters are well developed and Gore by Steve Johnson is pretty good. There is a cruel impaling, a tongue being bitten, the fingers pushed into the eyelashes, etc. The scene where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) pushes a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot.Give this a look. Followed by two successors.
