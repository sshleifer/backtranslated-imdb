I loved this show. I used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and driving down the road to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch of Gandhi in the kiosks as a masterpiece. The set design and light was out of this world and created an atmosphere that you felt you actually lived in. V unusual for a comedy. Unfortunately, I have only found another person (other than the other reviewer here) who ever knew this program existed. In fact, I have to thank IMDb for the existence and prove to me that I had not imagined the entire series in a drunk haze that I seriously began to believe in!
