the league of gentleman has been the most disturbing British sitcom to be on television, and how can a fun movie be so poorly rated, they just have no taste this movie will make you look over and over again and still seem funny. /> <br /> It is surprising that it did badly, but it is British that the cinema does it for the longest time, but this time it is (in my words) a comedy with giraffe punks over Lady's, is a top British comedy and better than dodge ball, so know this and it won't show you wrong since I don't really laugh at movies, but this movie was fantastic through comedy with the best characters, but I was a little disappointed with where Much Edward and Tabb were in there to get back to writing this movie, and it won't disappoint you.
