This Metro movie is episodic, but almost a constant series of chases, primarily trying to escape the police, whether genuine or imagined, when Buster fails for a escaped criminal. It is consistently inventive and entertaining. Its greatest value is to document what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties, as 95% of it was shot outside the streets and the building exterior of time. A gem moment and a gem sequence are present here. The big moment is when a train quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with Buster sitting on cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within seconds. The big order is with the phone box next to the elevator - one is constantly wrong with the other with running from floor to floor - one of the big Keaton gags. <br /> <br /> Kino's prints are crisp and clear - almost untouched. There is a violin / piano score accompaniment. This is one to seek and enjoy.
