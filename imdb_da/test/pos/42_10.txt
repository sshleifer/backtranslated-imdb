This is one of the movies you just won't end up with. The characters are rich as a good woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people who lived in a guest house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken by a dynamic big-hearted woman who runs the house, and it's stories based on his experiences. I couldn't believe it was made for television. It was so well done. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as a nanny and she brings so much life to this role. You will be right there among her boarders. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie so much I bought the DVD.
