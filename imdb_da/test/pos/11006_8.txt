A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet goes out to a dry lake to get salt sounds not very appealing. But this is not a popcorn movie, but a visual culture festival in which you participate in a rapidly disappearing piece of humanity. The beliefs, the epic songs and the poetry, the belief in a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life, is something that the West had in Homer's time, but unfortunately it is entirely foreign to most of us in the "developed" world . We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well-established patterns of life, often with serious psychological consequences in our increasingly rare communities. The filmmakers have intimately woven us into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and scary salt people. And made us see that there was more to life than the mall and pop culture. Then disconnect your ground lines, turn off your cells, turn off the driveway and lean back and lean yourself in a timeless adventure.
