"Alexander Nevsky" marked director Sergei Eisenstein's return to film production after an exile period and what he produced is a bald facial propaganda film that proclaims Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> There is very little plot: Russians unite to fight Germans Russia wins. The film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed in with some moments of German brutality (as a rather shocking scene showing German soldiers throwing Russian children on a violent fire). This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with some sound added. There are some dialogue scenes, but they are pretty lifeless on the screen, and the pacing is completely off as if the actors were not at the bottom at the same time when they filmed them. Eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rowing Prokofiev score during the case, which is actually one of the movie's greatest assets. <br /> <br /> Say what you want about Eisenstone's ability (or lack) to lead actors or tell his movies in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together to achieve maximum impact , and "Alexander Nevsky" everywhere shines through his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
