This movie is really sick and fun. I've made my friends cringe describe it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago, and I still have the song "Should we gather by the river" echoing through my head. <br /> <br /> So basically it's a Tromatized Romeo and Juliet, but it goes on what you'd expect. Let's just say, incest, references to child abuse, do (of course), but unfortunately have some kind of happy end ... kind of ... it's more weird than happy. The Cappy Capulet was brilliant! He has this kind of intellectual snob, he is abusive but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone else in the movie ... all with his sadistic role as husband and father. The meatball was also pretty cool. He was Julie's fiance, deeply vain with her, and soon he was disturbed by Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He is a beautiful, really sweet guy, desperate to find true love. "She makes torches to burn strongly!" Unfortunately, Troma just had to resort to the awful false green vomit and their other antics. They are really carried away with the things sometimes. But hey, this movie made a good impression on me. How often do I refer to it in real-life situations ... wow it is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy!
