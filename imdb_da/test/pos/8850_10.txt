John Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Unfortunately, as with most Carpenter movies, it is also one of the most underrated movies that are being scanned by critics shortly after it is released for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at that time people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​the "good" stranger. An idea arose after the success of "I.T.". And the very idea that a film dealing with foreigners could deviate from that idea was considered heresy. Human ignorance is really a scary thing people have to judge for what they are not for what they want them. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as members of an American Antarctic base discovers the presence of a foreign being (referenced only in the movie as a "thing") who can imitate any kind of life. Without knowing who may or may not be the creature, we see how any sign responds to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, just a slow and gradual descent into chaos, as more and more people are getting up ... not quite human. Carpenter succeeds in raising this movie to something far more than your average sci-fi / horror. There is no "what's behind you?" skip moments here. Instead of expressing an intense mystical atmosphere and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some well-balanced moments of visual terror without any thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creativity, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films. <br /> <br /> Rather than just throwing facts and plate elements into our face, Carpenter gives us a much more gradual and delicate approach. By expressing a mysterious feeling, he gives the viewer the freedom to interpret what has been exhibited in certain scenes while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpreting in film. Ennio Morricones score works all the way. It is minimalist and depressing sound perfectly suited to the movie's overall tone. Although I have always wondered how it would have sounded if Carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his films' cheese except this one) did it? The characters, while not so deeply developed, are still memorable thanks to the actors' good performances, especially Kurt Russel, who plays the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. Macready. It is worth noting how his character transforms through the film. From its frown "do not give a ...." attitude at first to a unit and head of the group of men trying to fight the "case". But even with that said there are no fake heroines here, there is no "grin in the face of death" moments and there is certainly no kind of comic relief, the film keeps the atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Talking about, here again Carpenter holds its tradition of creating a strong end. <br /> <br /> The quarter of a century after the release "The Thing" does not feel dated. And with the disturbing growing use of computer-generated effects, it feels even stronger than before, because it shows the work of life and the dedication of people, not computers. Combined with its openness to analysis, it gives the viewer many more reasons to see it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
