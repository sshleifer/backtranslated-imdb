To be honest, this is probably the best version in my book as an audio movie version of Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its structure as the first talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well. He makes the Jewish stuff feel. Peggy Lee is great and any movie that has her is always entertaining. Allan Joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. One question: since when does Cantors live in such luxurious homes ???
