I like the whole house and step by step the same. I don't have a favorite episode, I look like some scenes. but some scenes I don't like, but I had to say the reason I started watching this show is because it had Suzanne Summers in it. and my most preferred character was Dana. and Karen could be a snob sometimes, but she was also good character. I just like to see family exhibitions instead of garbage cans that have many drugs and violence. This show is much like other family shows where one of the parents is always strict about curfew and dates. Apart from step by step, my other favorite shows are full house, Sabrina teenage witch, Gomer Pyle Usmc, Andy Griffith Show and Dukes.
