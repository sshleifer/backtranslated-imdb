Despite its ultra-low budget, "Black Nula" is the most successful Portuguese movie from 2004. And I have to say a well-deserved success. What I love about "Black Nula" most is the intricate detail that Fernando Fragata went to keep you interested in what's going on and what will happen next time. It's very detailed and excellently advanced to a seemingly simple love story-gone-bad thriller. What is even more pleasant and ironic about this is that the characters are in the same situation, not one of them knows the whole story and is left to their own assumptions that make "Black Nula" a cut above the rest. This is definitely not a movie you want to go to for the bathroom, as you will undoubtedly miss something important. I feel that one of the film's main attributes must be the environment it establishes. It's scary but fun at the same time. I read somewhere to quote this movie by saying, "It was like seeing Hitchcock ..." and I couldn't agree more !! I love movies like that, where you need to be aware of everything to fully understand what's going on. 9.10
