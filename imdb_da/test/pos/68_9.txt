Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. The opening song by Mrs Andrews, "Whistling Away the Dark", will always be on my back roads. The baseline during World War I is great and exciting. If you are romantic, you will love this movie. This is a movie that I always enjoy watching over and over again.
