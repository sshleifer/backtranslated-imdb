Odd one should be able to stumble into "Classe Tous Risques" only by chance; It should be on any "best movie noir" list, including IMDb's. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever; Knowing his gloomy, delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressive face and short dialogues. Belmondo's detained performance in the Saute's steady direction shows only what a wonderful actor he could - and should have been. "Classe Tous Risques" is completely mininal, dry and cold without Melville's artistic nature, beautiful faces and fancy cars. It is almost film-noir that meets new realism. Davos' few hard words to his children describing their secret life from there get hold of the throat to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the movie - a voice-over tale of Davo's end in no more than ten dry, gloomy words - leaves you a hard blow in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A real jewel in the big crown of French film noir.
