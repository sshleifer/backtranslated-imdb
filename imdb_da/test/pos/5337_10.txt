A great animation movie that really comes up to the level of oldies like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends who also saw the series on TV. I was lucky because I didn't know people in Belgium were aware of "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and the good old theme started, it brought back memories of me seeing it when I was 5. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very fun. Some great sitcom style scenes, some word games or just plain jokes. The animation is not that impressive if you are familiar with the series, but it is still fun to see, you are aware of how it is being done. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: I can't just keep myself happy and entertained, and some of the humor can easily appeal to older people so I say: Go and see the "Curse of the Bunny" as soon as You can .
