I bought this movie from my local blockbuster for 99p and it has been in my video bookshelf for at least a year now. So tonight I decided to watch it, the film was quite different from what I had expected, and I found no humor in the only thing I saw was that it was a bleak look at people who deal with love affairs and sexual orientation, and I didn't I can really see the psycho-killer's plot really having a point except adding tensions to the end of the movie. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a good job. I followed her feelings and what happened to her. Some people would probably have seen some of the things she does so much fun, but I could really put myself in love with someone, but they reject you at every turn, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving movie and treated all the different sexualities well. I had expected something like Bound & Gagged: A love story, but it is a very different film. Not for bigots.
