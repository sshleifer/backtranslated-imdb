I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34th in NY. A friend told me about this movie. Audience response was very positive! Lots of good fixed laughs as well as some quiet moments of accomplishment. Top notch in all areas. A movie that makes you think and then realizes how lucky we all would be if we could return time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine it will come close, if not win, to the audience's favorite prize! The most surprising was the fact that the film appears to start as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group it began to satirize. There is no medieval humor at the expense of a group, just a slow realization that we would all be better if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started with.
