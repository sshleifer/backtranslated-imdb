I've seen this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy film festival in Berlin, and when I left the cinema, I felt like "killed"! I've seen many movies, but there are just a couple who call perfect as koyaanisqatsi or fighting club-subconscious cruelty is definitely one of them !!! half of the people left the screening in Berlin and I can understand them completely! This is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! a person who lives in his dreams day after day and does not want to see all the horrors of our lives and on our planet will be very shocked by this movie! if anyone reads this now that has seen s.c. and also think it is good: just contact me - so far i have not met anyone who shares my opinion - it was cool !!! this movie earns 10 points out of 10 !!! Finally, I'm really sorry my bad English- I'm not a studied person !!! (and so is gut so * g *)
