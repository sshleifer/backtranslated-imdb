Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda. Russia's people are threatened by two great enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. As commissioned to unite the warring, rival princes of the Russian world, Nevsky takes responsibility and fights the smallest of two evil (Theutonics). This influential movie was copied many times over and it still stays up to this day. The soundtrack of composer Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction is a sight and sound to see. Many years later, John Milius used many of the scene scenes, put pieces and costumes from this movie and incorporated them into Conan. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite lines from Conan was taken from this movie. "It's not the strength of the iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person using it is what matters." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor that James Earl Jones and Leader of the Teutonic Knights wear is almost identical. A true tribute paid from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays as the final law of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
