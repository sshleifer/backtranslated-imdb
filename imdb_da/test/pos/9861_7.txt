OK, if you wanted to judge the movie for now, it would not fit well. If you saw FI now on stage and everything was pretty cheese (I agree) But wasn't all the movies in the 80s like that (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, aso). But also the people born in the early to mid-70s or earlier have a cult status. It was time the plane on the way Tattoo would run into the tower ring bell and with his accent would shout "Da Plane BOSS Da Plane" and you would wonder what everyone's wish would be. People born in the middle of 80 or later would not 'I don't understand the hip because if you saw it now. It doesn't have a Harry Potter, Jurassic Park Computer animation FX. It was just a stage where you probably could even see the wire attached to a guy whose desire was also able to fly. But to us at that time it was a FANTASY ISLAND.
