When I rented this movie, I half expected it to be a low budget, plot less Indy movies, but thought I'd try. I started to see part 1 and couldn't pull me off until it ended 3 hours later. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies all the time. From writing to the director of the performances, I laughed and cried and sang all the way through Nan Astley's rite of passage from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I had never heard of her before, but now I will always remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are amazing as they lead you through the emotional disturbances that most people feel as they deal with an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film is set in the 1890s not only educates the audience about homosexuality during that period, but provides a statement about our society today. You must watch this movie, and probably like myself, take a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
