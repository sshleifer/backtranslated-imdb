Opera (the US title is terror on the opera) is one of a letdown after some of Dario's other films such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can't find Inferno anywhere.) It's one of those movies that has a good first half, but halfway through it is as if someone slowly began to let the air out of the manuscript and logic. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is stalked by a horrified obsessed fan. This killer starts killing people close to her in a most unique way. He ties and gags her and binds small sharp pins under her eyelids, so if she tries to close her eyes, she will shed her eyes. This forces her to see while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory Argento fashion. Unfortunately, halfway through the movie becomes sluggish and illogical. (This is especially aimed at the killer's motivations. I still haven't quite figured out why he's such a nut.) The end comes especially from the left field in the worst possible sense. <br /> <br /> But for the first hour or so, this is one of Dario's best filmmaking, and the camera's work is breathtaking. Too bad it couldn't hold it through to the end. <br /> <br /> rating: 7
