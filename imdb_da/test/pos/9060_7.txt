Not since "Harold and Maude" suicide has been so successfully used as the theme of a love story. The actor, by a top notch cast, is amazing. With a well-structured script, things develop at a comfortable pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and engaging. The film actually makes you doubt, what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicide Love". Find it out on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - NOTE
