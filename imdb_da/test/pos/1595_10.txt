If all the movies were to be destroyed and only one could be saved, Death in Venice should be. It is a monument in film history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious stating the point (an old man discovers the beauty of a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally and then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it depicts a period even further back in the early twentieth century. Life was slow compared to now. People should behave in a certain way and save their true feelings themselves. Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, manage to show how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, it must have been a shock to powerful to come by. We see his inner struggle, mostly on Bogarde, against Venice's beautiful background and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed of Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, there is no denial. No special effects, car tickets or battles to keep the audience attached to their seats. No perverted sex scenes either; The interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from distant and occasional smiles. So in reality, not much does this movie happen? Not if you want your senses beaten like a bass drum. If you want them to play like a violin's strings in a romantic concert, it's the movie that does it.
