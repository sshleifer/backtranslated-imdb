I absolutely loved this movie. Big, realistic giant footage for one thing and a touching, real story too. The quiet, underrated way of the protagonist, Franta, makes him very sympathetic. Human relations in history seemed so typical and possible of what one might expect in wartime. The connection between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty quarters that comrades can have for each other, and it is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not interfere at all with the story and actually serve to emphasize the problems the Czech pilots had in the RAF. The post-war history is a great reminder that too many WW2 disorders did not end in 1945, especially in Russian-occupied countries. The cinematography was also very good. Wish I could have seen it on the big screen.
