This much anticipated DVD memento of Rush's visit to South America in 2002 may be the finest rock video ever recorded. The image and sound production values ​​are amazing, even more so as they constantly fought for the elements to get rid of this production. All the tracks you expect from the RUSH catalog are here from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, which is brilliantly reproduced for the sincere, orgasmic Brazilian crowd. They actually singalong to YYZ, which is an instrumental and gives you an indication of their desire! The disc is the concert, and the other disc contains 3 multi-angle pieces -la Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the amazing drum solo as well as a 30-minute documentary on the band's visit to Brazil. All in all, this is a triumph, and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.
