I've just seen it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Director Neal Slavin's impressive star play includes William Macy (seen in The Contender's Last TIFF), Meat Loaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring Novocaine, also at this year's Festival). Due to Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, Focus Christian, but "Jewish Appearance" follows Lawrence Newman (Macy) as he fights among hate and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Abandoned between the Jewish shop owner down the street (Paymer) and his card-bearing antisemit neighbor neighbor (Meat Loaf) Newman faces difficulties in dealing with internal conflict and conflict around him. Guilty of knowing what is right, but not bothering to interfere and keep peace with the neighbors. Things become more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude (Dern), who all believe is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by cover. Will Newman stop the Jewish man in the end or will he flee? Go see it to find out. <br /> <br /> The action was fabulous. The script was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically amazing, the film was disturbing. Chilling. Emotionally intense. I found myself bringing my knees up in fetal position a couple of times. I have great admiration for everyone who has worked on it. I haven't seen a movie in good time for a long time. It touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
