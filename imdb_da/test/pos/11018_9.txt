I voted in this movie because there was nothing else to see. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. Her depiction of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% credible. Really, this kind of thing is not easy to do. She looks great. <br /> <br /> We know early on that this movie is going to end tragically, but you can't ignore it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot requires it, these people do stupid things because they are not right in the head - and the things they do are fully in line with their characters. /> <br /> This is just a good example of film making IMHO. Fantastic writing, great actor, good director. A movie for people who think about movies can be more than thoughtless entertainment.
