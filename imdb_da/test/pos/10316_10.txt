There are one or two other Shemp era shorts that I like more (ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think one can say - without much argument - that in this episode, Shemp gives his biggest comedic performance as a stooge after having reunited team in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene to scene, this episode almost doesn't stop: from Professor Shemp Howard's voice education with the glass-frightening Dee Green to his unsuccessful attempt to win a woman's hand in marriage your little ones snookums ... will you marry me * click *) to the creepy finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches. I would be referring not to mention the immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). Btw, she is also not underclothes and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her "Cousin 'Basil? Who knows, maybe the actual Basil was a" very "distant cousin, making it legal in some states (as far as I by).>: -]
