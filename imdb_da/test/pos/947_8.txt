First of all, you should see this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles, pornography, kinky sex and complete, horrible and really shocking depravity. I mentioned kinky sex, but calling sex in the second half of the movie "kinky" would be a great understatement. It's more like a blow to the face if you're not prepared for this kind of disease. That said, I can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo-snus genre brought to us by our Japanese. The plot seems to be pretty basic, almost non-existent: a girl is employed to perform in amateur porn movies. Don't expect much in the first 30 - 40 minutes. There is a dialogue - if you do not speak Japanese, it does not mean much to you - it seems to be occasionally chatting between the girl and the crew and the performer, then there is some porn (just sex) and after the stage the performers and the crew take a break. And then it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is talking about performing one more scene - this time bound with the rope. The abuse begins: whipping, slapping, hot wax ... Finally, the girl breaks down and cries. They loosen her. <br /> <br /> Then we see artists and the crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except the girl. She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave. She goes to the door, sits on the floor to put on her shoes ... and that's when hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit in the head with baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be briefly described (I will not spoil everything for you) as rape during dismemberment. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood", mix it with porn and you get the idea. It goes for about 20 minutes or so. SFX is very good, also makeup. Everything is shown, with no mercy for the viewer. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitors Q" was a very ill movie. After seeing "Niku daruma" it looked like an adventure to me. This movie is so sick, so depressed, so angry, so obnoxious that the hardest words pale to the final. Too bad it is only released on VHS so there is no subtitle available. But the film still works without them. So, if you are in ultra illness, extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre, check this out. I hope you will not have nightmares .8 / 10.
