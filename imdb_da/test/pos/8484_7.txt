Ray is interesting in parts, and technically it is very well made, but Ray is often sluggish and forgets some important details about Ray's life. All the film shows that we are parts where he is in his best, and most successful, which is good, it's just I would see some bits of his older life too. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles to a t, sometimes it is absolutely scary. I must say Jamie is the reason why I came through this movie. The first half is much better than 2. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's not as close as sluggish as 2 .. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to begin with being honest, so I really had no expectations for the movie, what ever. Ray's biggest problem had to be over the length. This could have been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other than those they used. I found the early part of Ray's life when he just started to succeed, the most interesting. He was humble then and some gentleman. And while the movie may have exaggerated its actions, he got a little too full of myself so I could break. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance like Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, seems like Ray. He even sings like Ray!. This is much more than an impression I really thought he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the movie, and without his presence, this movie would have been a complete and complete drill. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Ray is sometimes interesting, terribly boring with others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed with how routinely it seemed at times. Just because it is a bibliographic film, does not mean that it is automatically Oscar worthy. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the movie is above average at best. Worth to see, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations at a pretty comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
