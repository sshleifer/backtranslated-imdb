Very entertaining 50's western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans. <br/> <br /> Mostly Victor Mature's movie and pretty well done in my estimate. <br /> <br /> He is a staircase that joins a border post like a scout. The Red Cloud captured three of them on their land and took their belongings. They all became scouts for their loss. Victor has watched the Colonel's wife and lives on the post without much greeting to the rules. Action made quite convincing but no great depth or much sense of other character. <br /> <br /> 50s Westerns are my favorites, and it easily slips into satisfaction. A western of this kind is in the sides of the past and perhaps never to be done much again. One to enjoy. Gave it a 7 rating. Probably 6.8 worthy, but movies like these become more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For film-noir fans ... "The Big Steal" "They Live at Night" "Side Street" is the most amazing movie to be enjoyed. Bought and watched. Noir seems to be western in a way. Some long ago and never forever.
