The closer she gets ... is an artificial documentary that deals with the death of a person I actually knew. It gives an insight into the family's private moments that are involved in the most tried and tested time in their lives. Parents tend to support their children's work, in this case the documentary's subject went out and out. She was willing to share her death experience as a love act for her son. It is a most touching work of art that weaves the serious, quiet and lighter sides of the life of this family. The story is one that can make you laugh, but also cry as it solves problems we all have to face. I highly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in a most human way. This movie will touch you.
