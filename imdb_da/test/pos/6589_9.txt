I was very lucky to see this movie as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 just a few days ago. I have to admit that I am very much into films that focus on human relationships and especially those who concentrate on the tragic side of life. I also love most Scandinavian film offers, which are often a particularly deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. Character building in this movie is extraordinary in its detail and its depth. This is despite the fact that we encounter quite a few signs all with very particular personal situations and locations in their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very quiet and thoughtful. I still play some of these scenes in my heart, and I am still amazed at their power and meaning.
