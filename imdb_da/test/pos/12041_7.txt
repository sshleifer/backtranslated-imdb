Darr was a Super Hit movie that was loved by many people. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khan's innocent obsession with Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. In fact, it was an entertaining movie, but if you look carefully, it's not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan stops calling Juhi and tells her he loves her too small pieces. He gives a message in college that he loves her and gives her some great surprises as beautiful pictures of her. Instead of being flattered that a guy loves her for small pieces, unfortunately she gets very scared. I personally know 100s of people who get pranked by someone and these people enjoy it because they play a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie, entertaining, wide because of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Sunny Deol supposes to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and delivers a great performance. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would have been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so deeply. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but he beats all these guys on himself and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is sweet as always in a pretty good performance. Some good songs including Tu more samne are the best.
