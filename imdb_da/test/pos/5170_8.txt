Just looked at it on the Hallmark Channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but one can expect (one made for TV Christmas movies - come on!) The action is as good as any other '80s made for television movies. The story is, as I said before, predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a Christmas day, it will definitely scratch your itch. <br /> <br /> I was also happy when I learned that it was happening in Georgetown, Colorado. It's a real mountain town west of Denver. Very cool, as this is my home country. <br /> <br /> I was never a big John Denver fan (I've always found him to be pretty fancy), but he was a decent actor. He is very good as the good old boy he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, then do it. I'm sure it will be back in 2007.
