Looks like English-Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias. But I assure you that this is very much an Irish movie - and not English as the last comment seems to have suggested. This film is written by Neil Earth and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson - both Irish. Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember having fun in an interview about this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane was apparently brought in to raise agency fees abroad. <br /> <br /> Loved the movie, I just wanted to rectify a completely uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now with the review - I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been a fan of his, and Michael Cane formed a surprisingly good double action. It was great to see Moran's range as an actor as he plays several different ready-made characters during the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in comedy - as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive tour of Irish feature films. I laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?
