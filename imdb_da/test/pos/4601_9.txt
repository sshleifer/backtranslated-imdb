This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I had expected it for a long time and was afraid to walk in that it couldn't survive my expectations. It exceeded them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the final credit!), it is quite remarkable how a movie about stupid and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty and engaging. <br /> <br /> With its obvious math paintings, the film reminds the future of the film about the Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies from that era. In fact, this movie is in fact the Planet of the Monkey, but with people who are the mental equivalent. It moves at a slow pace, and Luke Wilson carries the movie pretty well with a character reminiscent of what he played in "Bottle Rocket." (There's even a not-so-subtle nod to "Bottle Rocket" in an early stage). <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was also frozen. <Br /> <br /> Despite all its strengths, "Idiocracy" has the distinctive feeling of a movie taken away from the director / editor before it could be fine-tuned. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why a movie, this fun would just be dumped into a few theaters without advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing at all. <br /> <br /> It's as if the studio decided they wouldn't spend more on it and just walked away. Or maybe they thought the movie had a cult classic, and the only way to become a sand cult classic was to set it up to fail? <br /> Whatever it is, it's a shame because Mike Judge and especially this movie deserve better. <br /> <br /> I predict this movie will have real bones on DVD and a word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Fox leaders traveled in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
