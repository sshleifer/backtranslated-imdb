I had never read any of Sarah Waters novels or so Tipping the Velvet. I only heard of Fingersmith as I ran through the "The L word" sites. The story of Fingersmith interested me, but I passed it away and thought, "Lesbian in Victorian times that never ends well, I have enough of the lesbo series and movies that do not go where" <br /> <br /> But under Christmas my local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought the DVD, and my life has never been more colorful. This mini-series deserves to be appreciated and praised. The action is so great that I rarely call it. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and many more, whom I cannot mention, brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by a little gesture, a little glance, a little touch, they made their characters right and as a viewer I couldn't help it, but take them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Fingers, set in Victorian territory, is a story of Sue's thief who loves and lives with his "family" of pickpockets. Little did she know that her fate is associated with Maud Lily â€” a slightly shy, jerky girl growing up in a manor miles and miles away. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself cannot touch it unless she married. Worst of all, Maud's uncle makes sure she never wants to keep her in prison in the house. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming, beautiful thief with a heart as bad as any. He wants Maud's happiness for himself, and to do that he sets up Sue as Maud Lily's girl and asks Sue to persuade Maud to elope with him. As time goes on, it would be easy if Sue did not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And it would be easy if the story was what I just told. I don't want to spoil so I want to stop there. But I can wake you up that everything is twisted and turned before you can be aware of what has happened. When that happens, you then ask what will happen next time. On top of that, the story is filled with passion as opposed to others. There are no self-seeking sexuality issues, "Oh my god I like girls" moments because the girls in Fingersmith are buried so deeply in their own darkness that they can hardly care. The story of such a twisted plot moves as smoothly as water, runs passionately, but strangely quiet. <br /> <br /> Weeks have passed since I looked at "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes still haunt me, and Sue's words still warm my heart, "You gem, you gem, you gem," she said. And such a gem is it.
