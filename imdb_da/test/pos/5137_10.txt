HOOT is about these three teenage children trying to save a bunch of diggers. Now for me, I think it right, they stand up for what's right and what's wrong. In this movie, a child's name Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. And when he gets on the bus, a bullying name, Dana Matherson, begins to bully him the next day, Roy throws bully and runs off the bus and chases the mysterious run boy. After all, that Roy finally meets Running Boy, called Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), it's actually his nickname, his sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave it to him because he can catch Mullets with his bare hands. Anyway Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and they join forces with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism that happened there, and later he gets a bit of one of the dogs lying there to protect the construction site. So they stood up to the muck that drove the bulldozer and everyone had to watch the weeks, it turned out to be a good movie because it showed where the kids can make a difference in life by standing up to what is right and right. What's wrong. thats what is good with this movie. It teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is.
