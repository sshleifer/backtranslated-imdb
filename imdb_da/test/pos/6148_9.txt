An example of genius film formation. The epic story of three great phases of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. Rarely does a movie come together that makes me say aloud most of the show, "this is a really good movie ...." over and over again. That's exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really don't understand how anyone liked it. I found myself crying and grinning at the same moment, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The action is excellent. Eric Mabius - Why isn't he completely over film screens? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless screen display affects me in deep visceral ways. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best film producers around, and I hope he continues to rise to the challenges he faces while trying to give us art in connection with violent commercial filming. <br /> <br />
