One of the many backwoods horrors that came out in the early eight years, and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, even though the killer might have been a little more scary, so he looked just like a bold veil. <br /> <First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to these mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teenager arrives, it doesn't seem to be very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. It's a shame that we no longer get movies like this, and if we do, it's usually a boring horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is more addictive and frightening than doing, because the gore factor is really low in this movie I was not happy with, but it is still a good movie. All in all, you have to look long and hard to find this movie, and if you find it you like it and also take care of ending up with the final girl and killer, this is not exactly what you would expect.
