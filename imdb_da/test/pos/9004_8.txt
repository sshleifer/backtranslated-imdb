Like most sports films that have come out in the past, this movie is similar to the fact that it is based on facts. What sets this film apart is that it's about a rugby team, a sport that isn't too many Americans familiar with. Set aside, this film is very rewarding piece of film noir. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall", but with a smaller budget and an independent film experience. It's a great effort by director Ryan Little to bring us a story of a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down), like Rick Penning, who finds himself in a strange place, on and off the field. Despite a few plot lines holes, this movie has heart, each of its viewers rewarded with good characters that we can identify with. Also good performances by supporting actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Ricks Dad). I felt myself through a lot of different emotions watching movies, eventually I was left with a sense of faith in humanity and a hope for the future of my children, especially if there are coaches out there like Gelwix.
