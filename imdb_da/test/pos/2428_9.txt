I wouldn't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irreversible evidence against Anna Anderson. First read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the true Grand Duchess Anastasia might have known (forensic evidence in Anna's favor aside). Second, compare the images of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Everyone can see that they are the same person. Third, visit Peter Kurth's website (url below), where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests, and why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRENCH SCHANZKOWSKA" link) ). Even Schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were actually the same person; I will never be swayed on the contrary. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
