The first time I saw this movie, I liked it for so many reasons, but I simply did not. It just seemed a little boring. But there was a little question I had about something I saw close to the beginning of the movie, so I saw it again ?? and then it finally clicked on me. I first looked at the movie that knew the "surprise ended" and although I would definitely not recommend the end to be spoiled for you, I still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the movie and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events that all raging to point to a very eerie scheme. <br /> <br /> I don't think anyone will love this movie or even like it. If you like any of the actors, you like this movie because the play is pretty strong and they all get a lot of screen time. If you like mysteries (namely Hitchcock) you will like this movie. If you like independent or psychological movies, you like this movie. It really seemed to me at all these levels. If you don't like the actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But that's your loss. Personally, the only thing that annoyed me was the accents. Good try, Alan Rickman, on the American dialect, but it wasn't much improvement from the scene in Die Hard. (The wonderful voice, however, constitutes the unusual accent.) The medley of accents in the film was a little strange, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly annoying. Also, the camera's change from scene to scene was clear and can interfere with some people, but I actually think it's added to the scenes (or stage? I really can only remember a scene where the change was very different, but it worked). <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how complicated the real thing is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half, so more views aren't difficult), I seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering, "Why just happened?" or "was it conscious?" I like movies that make me think. This one does. So just watch it. Twice.
