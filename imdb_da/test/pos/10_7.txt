If you had asked me how the movie was in the whole movie, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theater feeling dissatisfied. After thinking about it, I think the problem was the end of the pace. I feel that the majority of the film moved a little slowly, and then the end developed very quickly. So I will say that the end left me disappointed. I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can shop! Also the various relationships between the signs seemed very real. In addition, I thought the different lines were well developed. All in all, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. Conclusion: Good figures, Great plot, Bad written / edited ending. Still, go see it !!!
