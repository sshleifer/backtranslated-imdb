Every time I see this show, I'll just shut it down and curse the decision makers to waste my time every week. The dialogues, or the monologues rather that everyone just frightens nothing about nothing, just become so boring. For example, the episode I saw yesterday began with an seemingly endless hike on how a particular bowl (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs might) always manage to make the Gilmore family a war of all. And it was just the few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> So it works every time, lots of lines, with absolute zero content. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, however, something happens. Babbling stops and suddenly there are those wonderful quiet, emotional moments. For example, this week, Lorelai's collapse was on the estate agent's. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is worth it.
