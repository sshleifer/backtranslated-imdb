If you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy, then this film is highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer gives an excellent performance here. <br /> <br /> The movie also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub-movie asks for 'silent running'. <br /> <br />
