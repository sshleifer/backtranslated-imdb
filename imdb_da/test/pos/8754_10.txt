The best thing to say about the movie "Traffic" is that it has noticed the superior British mini-series "Traffic". As many people have noticed, the current film suffers from trampling history to accommodate the short-term attention of the films and the turnaround time for theater owners who measure the success of the movie at the over-priced food sales. <br /> <br /> I first recorded this mini series in 1990 when it appeared on Public TV and have seen it many times. The entire documentary series has a strong element of tragedy and stupid about it, as the characters all move towards their possible destiny. The strongest of the three stories is the Pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army in a staged show of power for the benefit of Western politicians. The family's adversity is the same as for the rickshaw pullers family in the "City of Joy". In the end, the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. The Pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance for today with the struggle against Al Quaeda's supporters and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor in Pakistan and Afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money in those countries. The film makes a point that farmers hardly see 25% of the aid, which should encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> With the American inability to see anything but black and white - good guys vicious guys - it's interesting to see another view where there is nothing black and white, only grayscale. <br /> <br /> Possible front spoiler. The only problem I had with the story was that instead of continuing as they did before, as they would in fact be a fictional work, they had to pack it with the "evil" to get what came to them. Apart from that, this was a fine job of the kind we see too rarely. The cast was excellent and the German and Pakistani places helped give the film a "second" feeling (which change it made to see Germans as something other than the bad guys in another World War film).
