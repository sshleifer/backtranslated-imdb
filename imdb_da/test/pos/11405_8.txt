All you need is a good house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West leads this exciting and chilling remake of the original from 1979. This version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) must work for an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Grant). The house is a beautiful wood and glass masterpiece from 1970. Secluded and peaceful. The children are already in bed, the wind builds and is associated with downward rain. The phone starts ringing, calling, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a terrible way to survive in fear of the creepy alien at the other end of the phone. Belle is great as the innocent, clever and strong teenager's babysitter. The foreign voice on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also highlighted are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.
