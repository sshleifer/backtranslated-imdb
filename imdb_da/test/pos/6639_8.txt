What Bergman has got here is "What if all the bad things happened here in Sweden, to nice people like us?" And what he gives us in Swedish languages ​​with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and with the help of what seems to be genuine Swedish military vehicles) is what was known from war movies in almost all other countries in Europe - all confusing invasions and against invasions, political lies, internment camps, faced confessions, summary executions, torture, coverings, "collaborators" and so on. As in a modern short story, it is abstract, without real names, cities or countries. But the stronger faction is "Nazis": they strive for self-reliance, and some carry shiny knees. An even whip thing with a riding crop (ok, it's actually a stick). That sacrificial couple is called Rosenberg. Except for shame, they feel to find dirtier ways to survive - and who wouldn't do what they did - whatever the above suggests is that the title is clearly meant to refer to Stockholm's actual compassion for the Nazis. What we show is what Sweden might have looked like if Germany had asked for more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the fog of war from a comic passive couple who ignore the troops, the long convoys, the bombed buildings, the news reports, and c. They don't even interfere with finding a functioning radio. They are the ultimate in "Not in my backyard". They talk about wine and lingonberries; Meanwhile, friends are mysteriously consistent and growing numbers of troops appear in the city. They show no curiosity about the war that has been going on around them for many years. The man (Von Sydow) is grown, sulky and a navel gazer; the woman (Ullman) is something more impulsive, passionate and outgoing. There is a beautiful scene where the man talks about his violin: the producer says he offhandedly fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest stops with the cultural art in his hand - or more precisely, his own warm feelings about owning it and the security as the ownership assumes. Not in my backyard! But when war finally breaks into their bucolic idyll, man's fog, an irritation in good time, becomes a responsibility, the end he overcompensates for - as is often the case - as Bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. Definitely worth a look.
