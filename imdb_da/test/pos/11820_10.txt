Very nice movie! I watched the channels on my television, and I usually ignore the channels as air drama movies, but then I saw this channel flying old school movies, and this is where I watched this movie. Only when I saw the title "The Cure", I thought it would be boring, but then I was hooked when I saw Brad Renfro in this movie (because of one of my favorite movies from all the time is "The Client" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes got better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I shouted hard in this movie, which I usually do not do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that are very striking and made me cry hard! Now I bought my own copy on DVD, and I always recommend it to everyone!
