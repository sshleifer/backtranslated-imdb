After spending five years in prison, dr. Thomas Reed, who is played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresca, he moves to the Purgatory Flats and wins up to the tending bar. He soon meets the delicious, English face Sunny (Alexandra Holden). "You are evil." he tells her. "You have no idea." she replied as she dragged her off her comfortable screw and dragged her cig for a long time. Reed finds himself rooted in the family's violent problems, and the five-dimensional story unfolds toward the desert and the desperation of the oil-drained western city. <br /> <br /> Canny direction. Great performances. Excellent entourage work. And some bright scenes that sizzle like the sun in Purgatory.
