Historically, this is not among the best or most wisely written Columbo movies, but the film is extremely well made, with excellent control and really fine acting. <br /> <br /> In particular, acting in this movie attracts attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a good job with the film's actors. Approximately, he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavete plenty of room to play with, since both are credited here as unredited instructors of this film. Must be part of his director style to give the players so much space. It works very well for this movie. Maybe he did, because Colasanto himself used to work as an actor. He may be best known for playing the role of Coach in the series "Cheers", from the beginning in 1982 to his death in 1985. So Peter Falk works better than ever in his role as Lt. Columbo. Also veteran actor John Cassavetes does a really good job as the film's killer and is a good match for lieutenant. Besides them, the film also has Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent film, and also Pat Morita, in a small early role. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor in the movie is really good. Visually and technically, it is also a really good movie, with slow shots without any cuts. Also, of course, the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to create things and tell its story. The film also contains a few fine artistic and experimental shots. Of course, everyone is really fit for the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, history is not one of the best Columbo movies. Also the tracks are knocked out for a lieutenant is a little too obvious this time. It makes the killer come over as a bit stupid, as he didn't believe his plan was good enough, while the character of course is an intelligent man. This time Columbo also tries to annoy the suspects and other characters a little more than he usually tries to do to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's various behaviors are a reason why his character can come across as different as he does in other Columbo films. But it doesn't mean any worse here. <br /> <br /> The movie also features a very good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who after this became one of the permanent composers of the Columbo films. <br /> <br /> An amazing Columbo movie to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
