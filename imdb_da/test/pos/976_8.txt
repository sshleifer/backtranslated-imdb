I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2 / 10? It's really amazing, very fun. I would highly recommend this movie to all of you, adults, teenagers and especially kids! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14-year-old child who always tells lies, home and school. One day he had his homework to write a 1000-word story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he should go to the Summer School. Yes, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big Fat Lies", I think it was a story about himself. On his way to school, he hit a limo of a famous Hollywood producer and he gave him a ride. But the child forgot the story in limo. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course they didn't believe him. And the film producer he took the child's story as his new movie, "Big Fat Liar". When the child saw the movie's trailer, he told his parents that he had written it, but they did not believe. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth is never overstated. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this amazing movie, you won't be disappointed. Don't believe the 5.2 / 10 rate it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: So sorry, my English is not good enough to make a better comment!
