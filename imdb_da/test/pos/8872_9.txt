I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was amazing. The film is a bit off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and over the top, but also very fun and efficient. The sign should be quite terrible for why else would anyone entertain thoughts of killing their mother? Now Crystal's wife - she is a "snooze" that everybody wants to receive and thus her role, though smaller, is also effective because it must justify Crystal's ridiculous case of "author's block". While there are certainly dark moments, the film is not depressing, and despite the murderous intrigue that the protagonists feel, they also have redeeming qualities. Generally, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one that I don't mind seeing several times.
