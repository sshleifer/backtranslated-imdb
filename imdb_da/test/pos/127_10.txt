Former reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better overview of the film's details than I could. What I remember most is that it was just so beautiful, in every respect - emotionally, visually, editorially - just beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to watch and also have emotional content to which beauty is relevant, I think you will be happy to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. On a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it a 8.75. The only reason I am away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. If you are in the mood for a truly artistic, very romantic movie, then it is a 10. I certainly think it is a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so generally 8 , 75th
