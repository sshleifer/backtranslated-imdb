First of all, I must point out that I really enjoyed seeing this documentary. Not only did it have great music in it, but shots and editing were also wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film do not change that it plays to the Orientalist "East meets West" clich√© that plagues many Turks like myself. Okay, this movie tells the story of traditional and modern Turkish music in a very stylish way, which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds. However, the problem with the film is that it seems what it defines as "east" from the "west" eyes. I mean, as a jazz musician says in the movie, maybe there is no East and West, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by Western rulers to keep fear and hostility alive so they could continue to rule the world and "keep cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why don't you think about it?
