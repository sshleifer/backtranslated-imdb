Ms. Aparna Sen, creator of Mr. & Mrs. Iyer, leads this movie about a young girl's struggle to cope with her failing state. <br /> <br /> Meethi (Konona Sen) has been a dismissed child since childhood and has shown signs of error, no one knows why. However, the sleeping trend gets out of control when the job is assigned to her neighbor Bihar, where she is raped by some political goons. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia. She tends to be out of control over the years and gradually gets worse and sinks deeper into her private 'world'. The compilation of an "indefinite" (divorced) older sister and how her dominant ways make an already bad situation worse are indications of what a fine line is between abnormal and * apparently normal *. Ms. Sen also makes an excellent comment on the social alien of such persons. Social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly shifting substances. But what about the poor and the poor who are always left to cope with themselves and usually fall by the way? <br /> <br /> The romantic connection between Dr. Kunal and Anu were unnecessary. Also, the cafeteria scene where Dr Kunal explains to Anu, how truly their world really is for them was superfluous. Anu should already know all that. The English dialogue is a bit awkward at times, even though the play compensates for it. The wife and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth every single thing. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> Extensive research seems to have been done about this disease, it is very clear. But it is not clear if MDP can co-exist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Also in the beginning Dr. Kunal ECT (shock therapy), while inhibiting it from working for schizophrenia, only for extreme MDPs with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> The end of the remarkable story is evident for an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The film could be completed with a nicer note, as the world over the mentally ill can and leads a balanced and fertile if it is not very satisfactory, living under good medical care. Nevertheless, it is an excellent movie made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. HATS OFF to Ms Sen! No one in India could have done better.
