Another brilliant depiction of Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Mickey Hayden, a policeman who deals with psychic visions of murdered victims. I absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm, and I was not disappointed with "Eye of the Killer" (AKA After Alice). I only wish the movie had been released theater first.
