A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteer for a medical experiment that fails and makes him a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife from her childhood wife who is oppressed and tired of her lifelong life. <br /> <br /> The one-off priest falls deeper into despair and depravity. As things get worse, he struggles to preserve what is left of his humanity ... The vampire movie should really be exterminated now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchise, but the director injects new blood into the vampire's history by put simple things in perspective. These vampires have reflexes and no fangs, but still feed and die the same. Making the chief president a priest really opens a can of worms to question them actions. The pastor primarily gives birth to doing better, but when he meets his involuntary wife's friends, carnal instincts are included. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie intense erotic is that when the couple agrees for the first time, they are experiencing something they have never before, forbidden passion, making the scenario all the more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook adds some required humor to the movie, but it's only realized in the last third of the movie. We see the daughter lifting her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she understands her own strength, she just puts down her chair and continues. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> And the final act would not be out in a movie, or even the three Stooges as the couple fights for survival / death. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and stunning, and the scenes with those jumping from building to building are so graceful you can see the ball. <br /> <br /> Vampire genre feels fresh and alive after this, but more importantly, eroticism and intensity are lacking most vampire movies these days. It's violent, but from that instructor I wouldn't expect anything else. <br /> <br /> A truly interesting story with amazing characters and beautiful filmography.
