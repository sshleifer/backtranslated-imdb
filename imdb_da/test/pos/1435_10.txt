I watched this movie about 12 years ago and I still remember it as if I was just watching it recently. That's how much this movie has affected me. <br /> <br /> Considering this is a movie from the 50s, I think it was before its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject, some may have considered taboo then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartbreaking journey that an abuser chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audience was influenced by the realism of this movie back in those days. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think one of Frank Sinatra's best five shows was in the big screen. <br /> <br /> When others discuss movies dealing with mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to see.
