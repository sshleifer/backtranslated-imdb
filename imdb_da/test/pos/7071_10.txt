Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most gritty movies in the Mexican film history for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect Mexican middle class family breakfast: a cup of Buñuel's surreal motifs with a tiny drop of Ripstenian desert scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's Happiness and the Dogma motion films. There is a lot of sordidness, black humor, suppressed dreams (Teodoros dream of flying), incestual lack of control (relationship between Marcos and Luzma), non-true parallel stories, discreet violence, anachronism and <br /> <br /> a little sign of hope (spotlighted in Luzma, husband's return and "Un poco Mas" used for search motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I believe in a bukosian way), the king without the crown, who does not expect anything but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the lovable wife, put many faces out, but the only thing she worried was that her sons had breakfast; She is a loser in many ways and sensual in a few moments, but you will fall in love with her. Soundtrack's features (too much forest) give birth to the lack of technical benefits, intentionally, of course: out-of-focus shots, overloaded close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzying pans and sudden release savings. "Crónica" is something difficult to digest, it stuck in the throat and everything helps with it. It tastes bitter as a raw orange juice and sour expired milk, but you will enjoy it. So I recommend getting some Melox before the show because you won't be hungry after all.
