If you want to see a big little horror comedy with an eerie feeling of it, this is it. If you expect a blood and intestine, it will not be for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget this movie was filmed on, the music was amazing! Although the film was recorded on a reasonable budget, music and sound were definitely better than most movies with a big budget! The story was really well done and the director has to praise. There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! The action is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel, which I definitely hold on to! I have no doubt that this movie will be an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie curls the life story of a boy entering the career of becoming a digger. It tells the story of the feedback of each of the more amazing experiences that the robber duo meets. Vampires to zombies and even aliens! Our stars begin as simple grave robbers who steal for jewelry, but quickly become body carvers for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who requires organs for their medical practice. When the duo finds a way to get a vampire to send their cruel employer, they discover the tomb robbers that human trafficking with undead bulbs is much more profitable than stealing regular dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's house competing for the same immortals - and that is where both the gruesome gangs collide with the head with serious consequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies I've seen this year and reminds me of the evil death. Don't miss this one, you'll regret it!
