This is a gripping story that lends elements of the Kennedy murder and successfully uses them to create an excellent Western tale. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good music score, although it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the throw are excellent. This is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western, which depends more on history than action, and it succeeds because history is excellent. This is not to say that there is no action in the movie. There are plenty and it is very well designed. This movie draws you immediately and keeps you busy at the end. You will always wonder what is in those documents everyone is after. It also has some bitter comments on US politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why Valerii, in my opinion, is in a three-way route with Sollima and Corbucci for number two in the placement of spaghetti western directors.
