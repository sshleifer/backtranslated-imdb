I have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but they seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, as if you like that kind of thing is not bad, but it's a great departure and can almost be Cronenberg minus bio-mechanical nightmares thing. Except it is in French with subtitles of course. A man runs on the road at night coming across a woman who is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman dwells, wearing nothing. As they drive along, it is obvious that there is something that is not right with the woman as she forgets things almost as fast as they happen. Yet it does not prevent the man from having sex with her when returning to Paris and his apartment. The man leaves work and some strangers come to his place and takes the woman away to this 'tower block', a great apartment building called the black tower, where others of his kind (for whom the "no memory" thing seems to be the least of their problems) are kept for some reason. Time and events march into the movie, which mostly involves finding out what's going on and getting out of the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up initially, to come for rescue her. The revelation of what is going on comes in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. To avoid what seemed to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created in this what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing movie. I like this a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10
