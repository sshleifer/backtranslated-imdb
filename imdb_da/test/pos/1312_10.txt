This film is a joking story about the life of the author and the poet, Mishima. It runs through its past through its last day and through some of his stories, but is professionally constructed as it moves from section to section. It catches the taste of the man, his work and his times ... the difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are amazing .... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as copies for any set designer. I woke up at night and dreamed of the golden pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful explorations of human and art nature. After watching this movie I wanted to learn more about the artist's works. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
