Leos Carax has made 3 amazing films: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these films weren't that big, but it has youth violence, the beauty of the young wilderness. Carax in these three films was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about everything he saw but using it and melting it in his time. Pola X is a very different movie because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a $ 20 million monstruosity, a movie that has ruined everything on its way. After such a movie, you cannot do another in the same view. So Leos Carax has to change and he did. The film is not as beautiful as the first, it is more sensible, no more studio, no more dreamed of Paris, Carax has come into the end. It is not more pure, it is not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense of it.
