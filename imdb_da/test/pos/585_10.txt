"Why are there so many rainbow songs and what's on the other side?" Kermit poses this relatively simple dual issue near the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" as he sings his signature song, "The Rainbow Connection." As time passes by the question and the film only depth. <br /> <br /> I have to leave the review of this movie as a children's comedy, but look at it instead as a classic for every generation for love with serious ideals and a heartbreaking message that gets more warm with each year. <br /> <br /> As a milestone in my own life, creeping things up on me, I hear more and more the evocative tribes of the elementary diny, and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to everyone's life because we all dream. And this is about this movie. It's not just a lot of dolls - it's a bunch of dolls that have the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. And while the film's humor and joy always feels good, they are not a fair judge of the movie. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the strong feelings it will realize. And it all fits in: "Rainbow Connection" * is * Muppet Movie, and vice versa. It's existentialism fulfills children's entertainment - there is no simpler way to describe it.
