Overall, a well-cropped movie. There were the parts that made me wave, and there were the parts I hit my hands on, but I got away with something more than I went with. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial of fire in the Ramayana are far beyond what this film stands for. Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200-page book that puts women in India. The film is about two girls married in a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic principles of "unwritten laws in the family tradition" seem to be conservative India, let me assure my reader that I (after living in Delhi for 12 years) found whole parts that just did not ring these bells. I mean some things and some actions are very true, but some other things are just far from the mark. Especially today. Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director is trying to simplify both. And it fails quite badly. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you imagine a film about American Indians in English. Or French speaking in English. Seriously crushing. Even the waiter spoke in fluently accented English (albeit with a touch of colloquialism in the language of "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But chemistry between managers is palpable. If you like it hot, it's a movie for you. I think it is the greatest saving grace - the development of a true reality's love story. <br /> <br /> If this movie was about Radha and Sita, it would have got full marks from me. And in being about them, it could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes out there to say that this is what India is and that is the Indian community is like. And in that respect, it succeeds as much as it fails. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. India's dark secrets are not revealed. Only two girls fall in love. Like it happens everywhere else.
