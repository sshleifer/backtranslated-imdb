This was a great movie! It was a very enjoyable youth fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think if that were the only criteria, our culture would be poorer for it. So this movie is for "The Godfather" as new wave music is for Mozart. The point is, it's one of the best movies of the type I've seen. The women are all beautiful (as one only sees on California's beaches when making movies). It has a bit of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets Waynes World. There is lots of charm and a reasonable (yet predictable) story that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye cake cheats the screen. Joe Estevez may not need his brother's career, but does a good job of highlighting history as the ever-young uncle bud. Contains lots of expected absurdities like female rock band playing without the guitars connected. (Was it intentional?) If you are attracted to the box, rent the video, you will not regret it. As promised, it's good non-violent erotic fun!
