From the beginning to the end, this 1926 classic two-reel from Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun around the 20s. It is the now forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase, who was played and led by legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then, but would earn his continuation with Roach and educate himself on greener pastures in the 30s and 40s. Recently released on video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be viewed by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has almost been reduced, Charley Chase was considered to be the leader in the short-term comedy field in the declining years of sound. He helped Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy careers before joining as a team, Leo McCarey, and a host of other talents. It's a pity he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a movie. When you do, you will search other movies from this classic cartoon. He had the hand in over 300 movies and many of them survived. Re-discover this lost giant of a movie from a bygone era and its giant star.
