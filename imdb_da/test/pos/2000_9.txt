A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with beautiful sound and visual effects. Taylan Biraderler (Taylan Brothers) had made their first shot at a TV show a few years ago, as far as I know. It was a kind of Turkish X file, they had very good stories, but lacked visual effects. This time, it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh, it's safe, and it can also scare you. It has a good plot and some young, bright actors in it. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find so many things about you here. There are many traces in the film about his story and ends, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense of the words, the dialogues were written very wisely. So these make the movie one of the best Turk movies made in recent years. Don't forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
