Melancholy by Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left the right impression on me. Partially for the characters, many of which fall into anime fantasy / sci-fi stereotypes, but placing these stereotypes in the rather terrestrial setting of high school is a twist that I appreciated. Then there is the somewhat crazy titular character, which is something else: a main feature, almost amoral, girl with ridiculous talents and a secret that she is not aware of. <br /> <br /> The set up for the series is a bit of a mind-drive. Essentially Suzumiya, who is not known for herself, is a kind of super-powerful creature capable of godlike beliefs about creation and destruction as she can destroy and rebuild the reality of her whim. Our narrative and primary character is Kyon, a high school fellow whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi seems to make her pull him against his will for a club she begins to spice up her life because she is sad about normal life. She is searching for adventure, she claims three extraordinary members, each with secrets, and everyone ends up being drawn into her crazy schemes. There is a bit of crazy, but fun, philosophical consideration early as we discuss whether the world is just Haruhi's creation as she gets bored of the old and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist, or if they could exist without her. It is a bit of a violent, but an enjoyable one all together. While sci-fi / fantasy scenarios occur occasionally in the series, I find that the joy of the series lies in how normal things are while there is still this excitement of knowing that if things are too boring, Haruhi can destroy the world in hope about making it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and in line with what I expected from the anime typically imported into the United States; I like the drawn design and while there isn't a lot of action in the series, I think it's better that way. The series is told by Kyon's mind, and he does not play an ominous narrator, but only comments on what he knows and what he feels. He has a lot in his head, but he doesn't speak a lot, so it's good that we'll hear it. The voice that appears in English dub is acceptable enough, but I prefer Japanese to act on it. There are some alien aspects to the series, some of which include parodies and traffics in the fanboy ism that I found entertaining. For the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure, as the series doesn't really have a larger arc of history, but seems to take things one at a time, so it's an easy series to download and put down, even though I think that, due to its rather entertaining qualities, it is still quite difficult to lay down. It is also based on a number of light novels, and the author was directly involved in the series writing. Although it is based on novels, I still want the over-series to have stronger story arches, but I love how we naturally see these characters evolve and how well the series can play the quiet moments as well as the more discerning ones. Watching Haruhi grow was a good treat as well as seeing the conditions that develop between the SOS Brigade (Haruhi's club). It is not for everyone because of its mind-twisting premise and "extraordinary beings in a secular world" setting. It will probably not put actionboys / sci-fi / fantasy fanboys and may be a bit off-kilter for the more proportionate drama musicians, but for those who are willing to try something a little different or such a strange quirky series as This, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather refreshingly unique and fun series. More, thank you. 10.9.
