Like Steven Seagal, I am also a great Van Damme fan and have followed most of his films since the start of his acting career. In this flick, Van Damme takes the role of Jack Robideaux, a policeman who just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the border patrol. Haunted by memories of his past, it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of Ex-Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs in the United States that killed his daughter. Overall I found this movie to be very good, Van Damme is in good shape for 48 years and can really move. The action scenes are very intense, and the movie even throws a few plot twists in to keep you guessing. Unfortunately, Van Damme does not have the same intensity as he said 10 years ago, regardless of The Shepherd: Border Control is the third straight film that Van Damme has made, possibly opening the door to a larger project. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for a Van Damme fan or fan of action films in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie, not as good as death, but better than the hard corps. Be sure to give this a try, you will not be disappointed.
