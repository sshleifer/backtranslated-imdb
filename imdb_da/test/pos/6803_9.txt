One of the enduring classics of the MGM came out in the last years of World War II, that is the movie that made young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had made a couple of films as a children's actress before the National Velvet, but when it came out, her place in the movies was secured. Ironically, she would grow up soon enough after the National Velvet was out, and her next act as an actress was to gain significant adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her horses. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this would work because steeplechase horses should have confirmed bloodlines, and the pi is a topic not treated in the National Velvet. All we know is that he is a ruthless and tireless horse in the hands of Reginald Owen, and after he breaks free and causes significant damage, Owen releases him at a nominal price to local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> While these things happen, Mickey Rooney walks into Brown's family, consisting of Crisp, wife Anne Revere, and daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the open road and goes to the Brown family, where his father was once a horse trainer for Anne Revere's family. It is he who sees the potential of Pi (short of pirate) as a steeplechase jumper, and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to survive this chance. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in the National Velvet. The good book says you must have faith as a child and she has to save it. She infuses Rooney with it, trusting in Pi's heart and ability to leave a little to herself. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won a Best Supporting Actress Award for the National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who has hidden depths for her that the audience does not suspect. It turns out that in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory that swims the English channel and her prize money, saved all those years she gives to her daughter. That scene is probably what won her Oscar. National Velvet also won another Academy Award for film editing. <br /> <br /> Over 60 years after it was debuted National Velvet as a family classic has not lost anything. Its portrayal of life between the world wars in Britain remains a challenge. And National Velvet launched a film legend. Can't do much better than that for high consideration.
