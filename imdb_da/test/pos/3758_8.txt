What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' is only naughtier. The funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men in Tights) is actually fun as the analogue right Dr. Jekyll and sexy entertaining Hyde. <br /> <br /> The one scene that is really fun is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with her daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "How dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter?" <br /> <br /> Jekyll replies, "but Mr. I'm going on with the operation. "<br /> <br /> Lanyon responds back," Oh. Well then fu * * your brains out !!! "
