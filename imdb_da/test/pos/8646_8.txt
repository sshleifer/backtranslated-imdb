After two short scenes that initially do not seem to be related to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, naturally rich beauty behind a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd spot on Mulholland Drive, a twisted, thick wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two pull carts come from the opposite direction to throw into the lime. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacation women's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece pops up in the apartment and runs into the dark-haired woman who now has amnesia. Most of the movie's first part is Betty and the dark-haired woman is trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a weird key in her bag. This is mixed with strangely surrealistic threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays in a country of hoodlums and prostitutes. The above may sound a bit complicated and inconsistent, but it's not half that. The film is designed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It is basically guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and you will not have much confidence that comes to your own interpretation the first time. Although you have great experience with like-minded movies - such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you can't understand it in another view either. The study was aware of this, insofar as they had director David Lynch writing "10 tracks to unlock this thriller" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing inserted in the DVD. Lynch is of a particular disposition, these tracks are almost as cryptic as the movie itself. It does not help when trying to find out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to find out which parts should be "right" and there is a complex embedding of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual traces that they are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is the movie worth seeing or worth trying to find out? Of course, it depends on your taste. At surface level, the movie is definitely attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will seem a little slow and too uneven for some viewers. But these qualities and many other surrealistic aspects of the movie are typical of Lynch. A first-class Lynchian moment is the old couple initially smiling smiling as if they are strangers that people are trying to put a front. If you are familiar with the style and like it, you will find much to love here, although Mulholland Drive is in many ways quite undervalued for Lynch. It is also worth noting, for viewers who would primarily be interested in it, or who enjoy it as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a rather steamy lesbian scene. It's not free, even though I have no problems with free music, but instead is an important hinge in the movie. Like all Lynch's movies, it is easy to be enchanted in its unique approach to all aspects of cinematic art and its attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "armchair students" / "cinephiles") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch does not allow anything to pass unmanaged. He contains brilliant color schemes (such as abundance of red and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound as the ringing phone that transfers to the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a variety of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd break. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor blow through, such as the name "Winkie's" and "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks" characters that give some clue to some of the color symbols. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle traces throughout the film to help unlock the meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch himself apparently requires the DVD programming to be unusual - there are no chapters on the disk; You must either watch the movie in real time or fast forward or backward to get back to certain points. <br/> <br /> If the surrealism and the blurred meaning of the movie are attractive to you, or if you just love "puzzle" then Mulholland Drive is worth looking at that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least at a widely generalized level. I don't want to tell the standard interpretation here - it's worth investigating, but only after you've seen the movie a couple of times and reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs are written on film and interpretations; There are even websites dedicated to it. <br /> <br /> For my money, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it's not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score can still rise on subsequent views). However, the "twist" aspect of the movie is much better in other works such as The Inside and Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for the surrealistic details of the surface, but the plot does not carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about movies and don't mind thinking about what you see (as if the two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss it.
