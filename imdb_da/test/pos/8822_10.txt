I looked at fantabulosa! because Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors in the last few years and if you have not seen him in anything before you are first ashamed of you, and secondly, your hands get a copy of either Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love . This production did not disappoint - Michael Sheen turned almost magically to Kenneth Williams and gave a performance so tragic to move as it was good. Not to take anything away from the other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I don't know how he does it, but every achievement I've seen Michael gives him metamorphosis, until the character he plays really is credible, and no matter how hard I try, I can't fault him. Must go get my tea, enjoy it!
