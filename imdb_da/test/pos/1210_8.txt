This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that I think is not right now. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical cloak - brought a certain charm to the show, which has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had suffered an innocence then. A child could see it without seeing an episode of Jerry Springer. Look back now (I was 5 at the time), even though I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed the warrior more because of his mystery. Hogan was the branded hero who made an impressive public image. The ultimate warriors, on the other hand, were a masked man with few words - an out-of-the-box hero to another audience. This rivalry was as exciting as a child because of this duality in me popping it up for every champion. I had a place for both of them. Because there was also bloodshed in this long, big battle, the effort was high - at least for me as a child. Similarly, because of Hogan's defeat, this made him more human - I remember feeling sorry for him. <br /> <br /> All these feelings in play in the youth girls' soap opera made Wrestlemania VI such a good time to watch this game.
