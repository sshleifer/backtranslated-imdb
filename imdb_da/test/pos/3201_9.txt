I was probably not sure what to expect from this movie, it had a good cast, an interesting storyline, and a lot of other things went to it, but I still couldn't shake a cheek I had in my stomach about what it would be. I am pleased to say that I was very pleased with the result and regret to worry about it all the time. The movie's scenes were extremely exciting and were enough to maintain the early interest of the movie. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the film's characters, as well as what happened in the prison rally. Like most reviews for this movie, I have to admit that there are some unessecary clich√©s, but it cannot delete the overall power of this movie that resembles a good novel. Cast are all good, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and this film is one of the best movie-making movies this year. Definitely worth seeing if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
