I came out of "Rendition" with a list of errors a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? It is certainly a movie whose sum is better than its parts. These parts include a cast of big name stars, not one of them giving a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, a relatively unknown one, the one you will remember); useful if not provided and a manuscript that is both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. Metwally is an Egyptian-born American citizen who is kidnapped by the US government's transfer program, otherwise known as the process by which America tortures suspected terrorists to confess whether or not it is remotely true or not. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, calling in favor of an old colleague (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps track down her husband. Meryl Streep plays the head of the transfer program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned for the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. Meanwhile, a whole parallel story follows the daughter of a top Egyptian official who is ally to the American transfer program and her boyfriend, who is in training to become suicide bombers. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi is a very plot to pack into a two-hour movie, and I was washing my hands of everything, especially the Egyptian Romeo and Juliet subplot that felt like nothing but a distraction. But near the film's finale, a chronological twist brings all the plot strings together in a way that will allow you to rethink everything you thought you knew about the motivation of the various characters and make "Rendition" a much more interesting one. movie than it seems to be. <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like high school students who play adults twenty years older than they actually are - especially Gyllenhaal, usually a fine actor bored that you wonder if he is going to Pattern energy to deliver its lines. And the screenwriter must be arrested for having an actress as good as Meryl Streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one-dimensional dragon lady. The film, of course, strives for relevance, but instead of solving the collapsed web of arguments surrounding the national security issue, it is levied just below the middle of the debate in a predictable way. There are moments when you may think that the movie comes in an interesting direction - what if Iferspoon actually began to doubt his father's past? What if Metwally had actually been in contact with terrorists accused of his interrogation? But no, the film takes the road to least resistance. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, I recommend this movie. I know I have done nothing but list a lot of mistakes, but it has the head in the right place and it is entertaining or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
