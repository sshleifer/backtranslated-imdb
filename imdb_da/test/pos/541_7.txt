I was impressed by this movie because of the quality of the actor and the strong message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays a part of a fleeting, irrational and possessive mother who constantly tells her daughter to stay together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is questionable, but initially she has no choice --- The connection with mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> Over time, the girl sees that the mother is out in fantasy flights and does not have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother go over her heels for a beautiful, seductive guy who loves them and leaves them. She sees that the mother doesn't get it. So how can she approach her mother for guidance? <br /> <br /> The mother leads the girl to a drama expression and sees the daughter act out of the mother's part in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. This causes a period of depression, and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson takes hold. <br /> <br /> There is sign growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents, but emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become their own separate person.
