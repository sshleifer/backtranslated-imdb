I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first, I didn't recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary to China who came home to find a wife. There were many twists in Mr. Cobb's attempt to clean up the town hall. His methods of making the punishment appropriate to the crime are likely to be illegal, but it is not a reality-based movie. This would be a perfect movie for kids except that there is female proximity (just pasties at Grace Bradley)! The old phones are enchanting. The only mistake is a problem typical of the day - Caucasians are used to representing Chinese men. This is offset by the positive way in which the Chinese are portrayed. They are the wise, good and kind guys. Trivia - A Bekin's truck appears in the movie when police run out of Black Maria's.
