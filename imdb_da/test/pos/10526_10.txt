Unfortunately, this original blend of action and grin is kept from bio-graffiti as it rests in the Columbia vaults for all eternity. Shame since this can be Jack Starrett's strongest movie and has a witty script by a young Terrence Malick and fully realized performances by his two leader Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant. Many standout scenes include interrogation of the bathtub and electric shaver, and an intense shooter in an abandoned building as it is torn down by a devastating ball!
