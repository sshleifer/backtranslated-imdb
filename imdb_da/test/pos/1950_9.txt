Solved on the basis of actual events, "River's Edge" is a movie, much like David Lynch, of a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time time time. With top notch appearing by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we can forgive the average play of everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller) emerging from a bridge (murder # 1). Tim hears so a person shouts when he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder # 2). Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. Everyone is horrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim Jamie (Danyi Deats) was a friend of theirs. Despite all this, no one goes to the police. You may think this is unrealistic, but that is what happened in real life. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you will know that the same thing also happened there. Through all this, Layne (Crispin Glover) works to keep Samson safe, though no one (including Samson) seems to like to keep him out of harm. As time goes on, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged man who treats drugs to local teens, has also killed a woman before (murder # 3). From here, things start to close in on Samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed, but not as you might expect. <br /> <br /> In the film, we learn about three murders, each with a different reason, a different reaction, and another effect on those involved. When Tim drops his younger sister's doll out of the bridge, we never become aware of his motive. However, we see the younger sister's reaction. She cries and screams while her mother consolidates her. Later, her brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps her put a cross in the yard for her doll. Jamie's murder scares everyone (except Samson, who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when asked by Layne why he did it, Samson replies, "she spoke sh * t."), But they do not stumble or scream. , run away and continue their lives trying to forget what has happened. In Feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he had done. He even mentions that he is sad and that she loved her. From here we see the different ways we can be affected by death. In the movie, it's easy for us to identify with teens because they don't know what they feel or how to feel about their friend's death. Similarly, we do not know the audience how we feel because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously sad of death and realize that Samson must be arrested, but we do not feel strongly Jamie as an individual. There are more similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks" (1990-1991), especially in the film's overall feel. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking of "River's Edge" when they created their series. After all, Tim Hunter continued to manage three episodes of "Twin Peaks". <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover's performance as the hyperactive, scary Layne is an Oscar worthy achievement. Always in a rush and always worried about keeping Samson from being caught, Layne is an intense character who seems to be on the move. If you've seen Crispin Glover in a movie, you know he can deliver a line like no other. It is always a treat to see him perform. The other great achievement in "River's Edge" is by Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, the closed drug dealer who has a leg and an inflatable sex doll he is talking to, is called Elly, reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's movie, "Blue Velvet" (1986). River's Edge is great movie, and I think it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when we really have to step up and speak against the evils of the world.
