<br /> <br /> First of all, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the topic of the portrayed LA punks. <br /> <br /> I listened to that music and I loved that music and I read a lot of the little zines that were made in the early 80's and it was not so easily achieved in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you don't like this kind of music, why write here? I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and America, so why do you, who finds this music "conflicting" care to comment at all? <br /> <br />
