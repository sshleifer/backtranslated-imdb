I watched this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian movie I have seen in the Tamil language, and while sharing some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping history), the director is more than just entertaining. The film tells the story of Amudha, a splendid nine-year-old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted and thus embarked on an odyssey taking them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Beautiful visual mixer with horrible scenes of violence explicitly making a point even though it is a simplified one. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few children's actors I have seen that can be perishable and yet not annoying. Her charm and beauty held the film together.
