Leonard Maltin gave this movie a horrible BOMB rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. What movie did he watch? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This movie is a joy. It is fantastic. It's delicious. It is well fitted. It is beautifully photographed, making a brilliant use of color. Right from the opening scene, the film takes your attention and tells you that this movie is a well-designed satire of the entire Spaghetti Western genre. The movie is being laughed from the beginning to the end with tribute to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip and the famous showdown in Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to do satirical work. It's too bad, Mr. Maltin rated this movie as bad as it is undeserved. One can only guess about his reason. I suppose he completely missed the point in the movie and expected something more serious than this movie is supposed to be. Kudos belongs to everyone involved in this project. This movie is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literary films and appreciate satire.
