The biggest bet plus the best cast ever gathered in a movie by Director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn on the cover. Someone said that this movie is good because it is directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I am convinced that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon had given me a truly amazing performance that I cried out my heart. Their action is so genuine! No doubt this movie is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
