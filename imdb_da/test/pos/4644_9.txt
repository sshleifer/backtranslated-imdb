This is basically a goofball comedy, with some weird pacing due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, it was their first movie (Fox had previously been in a short-lived television series and a television movie). Since the movie is basically a race / scavenger hunting type movie, like "Cannonball Run", "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World", or more recently "Rat Race", there are no main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters, splitting the screen and allowing plenty of mini-plots. Usually these kinds of movies are a way to get the maximum amount of stars (or stars) on a movie. <br /> <br /> This one has hold, one being the primary team to which Fox belongs, who are the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more of a stereotypical Disney fan, a college boy who is not aware of his younger brother, whom he thinks of as a lazy punk. When forced on a team together with the elder brother's boyfriend, they are forced to work together. Since this is the main plot, it becomes the most screen time. <br /> <br /> Some of the other stupid charts stand out. The Blue Team is about an overweight rich kid whose father just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house. They end up with a cool custom van that had a built-in computer (in 1980!) To instantly solve the puzzles, plus play video games with the time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, continued to play Dr. Shoulder row on "St. Elsewhere", and later he was on "Babylon 5". I will also admit that I still laugh when Barf, while trying to shrink a word a'la Scrabble, comes up with, "Fagabefe?" This is much more fun than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. The other three teams have plots connected together. The green team is a bunch of French boys, with mostly beer buckets climaxing in a collapse for one when the hunt leads to Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They get the chance to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. The white team of nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease", but continued to play a critical computer geek role in "Wargames" and later Tim Conway's sidekick in some of the Dorf series. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 80s, there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. The early video arcade, from back when they were cool, is always a plus in my mind. Look for Paul Reubens and his quarter-firearms. There is also a mini golf course and a roller-coaster. The film is actually an ok family movie, simply because profanity is almost non-existent, and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The odd pacing thanks to the yellow team osteic dramatic moments will put parents in bed while their children can giggle with giant melons at the Fat Burger (oh, they actually have a special melon plate? It should be, right?)
