Mike Nichols in the finest form. I was not a fan of "Closer" so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy in the darkest conditions. Only a sliding tone could have ruined this convincing image, but Nichols and his very strong A-list never threw a foot wrong in this biopsy of a deeply erroneous but totally convincing congressman. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator plays, and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy is rising. Rarely is film humor laughing loud and also smart ... This hits time and again with a biting satirical edge that makes you laugh and cry in the state of the world (often simultaneously). <br /> <br /> Another big plus is the length of the image. The film is based on George Crile's cool book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim for fame is "The West Wing") must have been making a bold movie, but what we get is a breathable 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen and recognized to find an extraordinary balance between the darkest of the dark subject and its touch sensitivity, if it makes the obvious connection between the help provided by Sylt and Wilson and the ultimate consequences (9/11).
