The first murder scene is one of the best killings in movie history (almost as good as the shower spot in Psycho) and the actor of Robert Walker is amazing. A psychopath involved with tennis star in swap kill. It's the story and the overall this movie is very good, but there is a problem: why isn't Guy Haines going to the chief in the first place.4 / 5
