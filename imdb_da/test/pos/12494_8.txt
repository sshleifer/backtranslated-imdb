And I love it!!! The Wonder Show will pick up a cool audience and when it is canceled, the DVD sale will go through the roof. This is a very fun show in its own ways. It's a parody of children's shows, namely Sesam Street. Our puppet character consists of Chauncy, a yellow furry monster with a hat whose host. Clarence is a blue lizard like things that make his own segments where he goes out on the street. He is a strange dog like things that refer to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the wise one whose brain always shows. Then there is the newswriter and the pink puppet. It's a very fun show, not really as unpleasant as you would expect, but more situations. They take 7-year-olds out on the street, tell them what to say, and get them to make average jokes they don't understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's videos, especially when someone doesn't want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but it's still a very fun show that I hope will last for many years to come. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 out of *** *. 30 minutes. Tv MA.
