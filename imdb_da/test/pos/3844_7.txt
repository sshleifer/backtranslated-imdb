The duchess and her three kittens enjoy the high life with their devoted human mistress until the evil butler Edgar, with his eyes on a great heritage, decides to baptize them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile beings survive in the unknown landscape and the medieval streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. When they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he leads them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that is the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as the Duchess is ... Now ... Eva Gabor; But perhaps the most memorable revolutions of Pat Buttram and George Lindsay are that transform the old dogs Napoleon and Lafayette into a few bumbling southfree rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical tracks with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney Display's style has changed as it was at the cutting edge in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic dated feeling is just a result of being plonked in the Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more picky (a shame) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in recent actions like Aladdin.
