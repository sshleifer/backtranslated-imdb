Alter Egos does not come more fun than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G. Totally misled by his misleading and non-existent feeling of the Middle England Suburban environment of which his social background consists. He continues to live the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his spruce in London's Staines suburb, he keeps close control of his Posse, West Stain's "Massive". <br /> <br /> Spends his spare time between me Julie, his girl, Posse and teaches local eight-year-old scouts on "Keep it Real (advanced)" lessons at the state-funded John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> This is where the story starts, is told that government funding has stopped, Ali G then continues with a one-man search. "In the struggle for justice, I am willing to lay down my life, just as Martin Luther Van Dross did." Being his answer to the local media crew member when he interviews him about hunger strike while he is chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance plays here David Carlton, the outrageous and sinister Vice Prime Minister, Minster, who is "Even more Accident than Skeletor". Use Ali G, unknowingly, to lose Prime Minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. Looks Ali G like a bumbling idiot, his plan goes back. Ali G suddenly becomes an overnight sensation and a rescuer of the people working directly with Prime Minster. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences. Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings the immensely talented attributes to writing along with Dan Mazer, Executive Production and Act of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as P.M. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the parodies see their parts playing in a real-world that is constantly proclaiming "Keep it right "From their own little world, which is West Staines'" Massive ", is true comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full-length feature film, since he directed television work like Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few. <br /> <br /> Very real and very fun.
