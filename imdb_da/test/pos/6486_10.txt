Of all the great 30-star actresses, Miriam Hopkins has been the most bizarre overlooked and underrated. Her excellent film of the 30s and 40s is quite impressive, but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. Still, she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this movie, Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was known for her aversion to Hollywood, and the results have been a bad rep - undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heir who tries to save her dead sister's children from their guardian - the sister-in-law (Ray Milland). The movie offers several hilarious scenes that Hopkins takes a bath is a storage room, Hopkins enters Milland and Guinn Williams in a restaurant in Greenwich Village for $ 3 to act as "bohemians", and Hopkins walks around during one of Williams' matches. Milland is also excellent and very fun. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland make a good pair. The film also has solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are ok. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a dressed dress that is twice her size, is hilarious when she blows on stray hairs while smoking .... A scream.
