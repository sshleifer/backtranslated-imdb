Clever psychic drama about a wounded EU soldier (Clint Eastwood) seeking refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce any girl in sight until the tables turn, and he is being persecuted in a disturbing, Gothic toned finale. Never has a movie been so deliciously erotic yet disturbing macabre at the same time. This is undoubtedly Eastwood's finest hour (those who tunes for "Dirty Harry" will actually be surprised) while the rest of the casting gives uniformly outstanding performances. Try watching the movie on video, as TV prints usually delete important flashback scenes between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
