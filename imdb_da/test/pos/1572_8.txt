This is a low budget, well-traded little gem. Alice, a small town of Massachusetts teenager who is busy with her existence, goes to escape her mother who switches burgers and her own work as a check out at a supermarket. She goes out of Florida and stays with her richer high school friend, a freshman in Miami. After her car suspectedly crashes on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happened to travel to Florida. The couple, who are playing brilliantly by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, are far too hospitable and it turns out a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is enticed to stop prostitution, as the RV winds its way down the thruway in the general direction of Florida. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave Little Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their lives, and the couple's and Alice's choices seem quite credible. An excellent, well-made movie that you will think of when it's over.
