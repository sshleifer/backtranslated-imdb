Seen in 1794, the second French Republic's second year formed after the performance of Louis XVI, this film depicts the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, in its finest) and Robespierre (a forthcoming performance of Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his hometown, where he has since been deposited as the leader of the Public Security Committee of the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to "Terror Reign", which has resulted in executions of thousands of citizens, primarily by guillotine, believed to be against the revolution. Danton is convinced of the common people's support and is trying to persuade Robespierre to slow down blood loss. But Robespierre and the committee are worried that Danton's popularity will cause them to be overthrown and put Danton and his followers to the test as traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after coming to France from Poland. His Polish film business was closed by the government because of his support for Solidarity's union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity Union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship between Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reasoning against Robespierre / Jaruselski, who continues the dictatorial rule, even though they have lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish game "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and at the release, the film was criticized by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is to concentrate on the committee's behind-scenes meetings and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom instead of the activities on the streets of Paris.
