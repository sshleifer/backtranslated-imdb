I liked this movie way too much. My only problem is, I thought the actor who played the villain was a low-rent Michael Ironside. The corse ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson. I think Mike was busy that year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening". Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career movement. It is certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of the big big screen classic "Masters of the Universe". Not only does the incomparable Mark Singer steal it, it also has a fantastic support cast, especially the other girl from "Sliders", Uncle Phil from "Fresh Prince of Belair" and evil chick from "Superman 2". It rocked my world and is definitely a must see for anyone without social or physical outlets. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK AND ROLE !!!
