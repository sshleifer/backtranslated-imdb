Vidor shines like Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. Her brother David is so enchanted by their father that it is a surprise that he can tie his shoes himself instead of asking Dad to do it for him. Other reviewers have already outlined the plot I will not rehash it; However, I would point out that Nan, who is pregnant by David, is also married to him. This is not a pregnancy outside of the spouse, which would have been horrific after 1921 standards. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, who has been paid by David's father, tears their marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> Nan's death scene, with Judith in attendance, is a true heart-rending experience and very stressed with emotion. This scene alone is worth watching the movie, but there is far more to the plot than that; Why on earth are modern films not made with the same attention to history?
