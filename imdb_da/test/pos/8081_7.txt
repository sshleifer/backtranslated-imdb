I like the phrase "British Post War Suburban Paranoia", as one of the reviewers used. It describes so well the kind of movie John Mills excelled in ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) between "big" images ("Antartic Scott" (1948) and "War and the "(1956)). This obvious "Eric Ambler" plot had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend Charles, (invisible) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport. An eerie "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting room at the time and offers to give him a boost, but while he tracks the actress down Windsor informs him, she is already waiting in the car !!! (something fishy is going on !!!). Howard has fallen for his date and no longer thinks about it. Next night he finds his body when he comes home from work, and more, he finds his friend that Charles couldn't have rocked him as he is still in New York and Windsor doesn't seem to exist. Earlier on a patient, Mrs Ambler (Rene Ray), referred by Dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Johns), tells about his recurring dream of finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. It's a nightmare that is the case for Howard, but of course, when Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies any knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found at the beginning of Howard's Daimler. <br /> <br /> When Howard is low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of battles. Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the flat, Charles calls and while Howard is on the phone, an unknown attacker breaks him and steals the fighting !!! Who can he trust - who has nothing to hide !!! <br /> <br /> This is a top player - not quite the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does best, ordinary men are caught in impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
