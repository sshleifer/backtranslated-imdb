Gore dogs beware ... this is not your movie. This little nail bitter has very little blood and gut. It is basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worthwhile. But what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leaders (as opposed to open water) who find themselves in a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches their guidance. We do not want any harm to come to any of them. So when they start getting into dangerous situations ... we actually do. <br /> <br /> Now I like killer animal flicks, but I haven't been too impressed with Lake Placid up to Primeval (though I'm still waiting to see Rogue and hope it's a place as good as this! ) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. It's scary is creative, and it only goes into the chain of the mill that scares laughingly and argues for short moments of realism, so I was never annoyed. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went and two ended up in a tree while their girlfriend was killed by the crocodile. But the thing that has always affected me that is left out of the movie was that the crocodile did not eat the man. No. For hours he swam around the tree and still shook the dead body in the mouth of the friends in the tree. Seems to be if you come down here this is what will happen to you.
