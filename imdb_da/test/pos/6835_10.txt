But not for hip. And not for wisecracking. "Judas Kiss" nails the new noir thing just right. Great pacing and a sophisticated score round off a twisted story filled with sex, fraud and safe fire a liners. Inspiring work around. Kudos delcular to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best fame of the fatal age ... smart, fun and ultra HOT) ... I give this a 9 out of 10), and that is because 10 should be reserved for similar, Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros film.
