I caught this movie on TV after 30 years or more. Several aspects of the film stood out even when you looked at it so many years after it was made. The story of the little-known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable that almost resembles a Tolstoy-like story of a man's buffet of a cosmic arrangement that he cannot understand. Compare this movie with better known modern works such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List," and you begin to realize that the Second World War traumas were to be seen against the larger canvas of racism in addition to the simplistic Nazi concept of Arabian vs Jews. This film is about the Hungarians, who do not like the Romans, the Romans do not like the Russians, and so on ... even on the Jews' dubious relationship with their Christian Romanian friends while they are under stress. <br /> <br /> As I haven't read the book, it's hard to see how much has been changed by the instructor and scriptwriters. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian Bund's view of emigration to the United States with the purpose of making money only to return to Romania and invest its earnings there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the finest roles Anthony Quinn played with his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas" . <br /> <br /> The finest and most memorable sequence in the movie is the final with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi who are trying to smile. The father, carrying a daughter born out of his wife's rape by Russians, is a story in itself, but the director is able to show the vote by a simple gesture - the act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic recordings. <br /> <br /> Today, after Princess Diana's death, we often notice the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of paparazzi and the insensitive media (director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene as the cameramen get ready to hit Moritz). The interplay between church and state was so beautifully summed up in the orthodox priest's laconic statement "I pray to God that he leads those who have the power to use them well." <br /> <br /> Some of the short shots, such as a secretary to a minister who killed while listening to a petition - said so much in so little footage. The direction was so impressive that the editing takes a back seat. <br /> <br /> Finally, what struck me the most was the exquisite rich texture of colors that cameraman Andreas Winding gave - from the brilliant credit sequences to the end. I recalled that he was the cameraman of another favorite French film of mine called "Ramparts of Clay" directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I have not seen such use of colors for a long time, save for the David Lean epics. <br /> <br /> There were errors: I wish Virna Lisi's character was more generous. I could never fully understand the Serge Reggiani character - the only intellectual in the whole movie. The railway station scene at the end seems to be lifted off by Sergio Leone westerns. Finally, the film was mainly built around a love story that unfortunately takes the back seat. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie summed me up in more sections than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was made.
