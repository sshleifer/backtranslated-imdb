I am surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this movie. If you're looking for something else, this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical thoughtless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or another Hollywood loser. It is an intellectual movie that you must actually pay attention to so that some people may be turned off. But if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes, this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some pretty graphic sex scenes, so watch it when the kiddies are in bed. People who like Euro flicks will like this. Adam Sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely not their style.
