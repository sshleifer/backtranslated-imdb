This is a must for all but especially African Americans. It's time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns of African American relations. It also allows other cultures to look at fictitious humorous ways how positive African-American relations are and the outcome of them rather than the unwanted stereotype that plagues African American society. I love this movie a must see !!
