I went to watch this movie with my family, expecting a pretty crucial story like '' Mr & Mrs.iyer ''. And they came home thoroughly disappointed. So it is a warning to all '' vital story lovers '' to stay away. 15 Park Avenue does not seek to answer questions or give moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged. There is nothing loud and clear. It is a matter of every person, but also sensible. In fact, for me, it even raises doubts about my conscious sense of sanitation. The security, bondage, satisfaction that I find in my present is really what I am or really makes an illusion that we all desperately and sometimes ignorant cling to fake console the neglected 'meethi' which Are we all in one way or another? So why is Anjali so much fun that it is a point to show her thinking when she really is the harrow of the realization that she is a monster? Are we not all who believe that we are '' normal '', really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable to it deep down? Isn't it better to be happy even insane than to create the impression of 'normalcy' and at the same time suppress its fragility? meethi bold, crazy, sincerely do it.and society denotes her as "schizophrenic". The ending confused me first, but then you realize that courage and sincere faith took her where she wanted to go. She found what she was looking for, not caring what the community had to comment on for her search. And these are the seemingly 'real' people - anjali, psychiatrist and yojo - who never reach anywhere. my family thinks i am also schizophrenic in trying to sense a movie that is pretty much "insane" to the rest of the world.anyone willing to believe in my sense of reality ........... ?
