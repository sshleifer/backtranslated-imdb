By convincing the prime minister to back the completely unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, the rude chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader and thus enable him to exploit power. However, to his surprise, the plan is back, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to guarantee his political future. <br /> <br /> Puerile, raw, misogynistic and always scandalous: Ali G Indahouse, big-screen debut excursion to Sascha Baron Cohen's middle class Berkshire gangsta, are all these things and much more ?? that means it's my kind of movie !! Of course, there are those who simply aren't going to get the joke, and there will surely be people who find risqu√© jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography, and The Queen's nether regions offensive at last (unnecessary say should stay away!) but if you find such youth humor that is divisively hilarious, a fan of Baron Cohen in general or just want to see hottie Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you push, then she's fine!) so I fully recommend spending one and a half hours in the company of Ali G and West S Taines Massive. <br /> <br /> They are evil!
