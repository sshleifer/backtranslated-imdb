Before I watched this movie, I read the comment from someone who was not very happy about it. This I must admit made me anxious to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a great actor, I especially loved the believer. Don Cheadle was also wonderful. The film presented an interesting view of life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but it kept me interested, which most touching stories cannot do. It's a movie that is ruthless about whether you like it, you should see it. It was unique and I don't think anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. All the young actors have surprisingly well given the subject and the emotions that must have gone into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
