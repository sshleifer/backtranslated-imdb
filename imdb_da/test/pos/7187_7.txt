This movie is pretty much better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre Cesar", but it is far from perfection. The adaptation of the cartoon is good, some of the pictures and the dialogues in the movie are the same as in the book. But there are few things that did not make the film as interresting as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the fighting between Numerobis and Amonbofis. This was not necessary or even credible, even for Astérix's little love story. There were also some things that were missing, like the songs in the animated movie and some other things ... I was fooled by the movie because they hit the things I expected to see and they showed things I didn't want or needed to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same as the cartoon or the animated movie, but that was what I expected. In conclusion, even though the film is good, I still prefer the animated film, which in my opinion is much better.
