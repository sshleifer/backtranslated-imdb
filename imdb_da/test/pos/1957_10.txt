After reading some of these reviews, it is clear that some have missed that point. What is great about this movie (here comes the point), what is amazing about this movie, what is amazing with this movie is that there is no proselytizing. There is no sermon. There is no sermon. There is no sermon. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think of their collective self. It is only children who do what the children do - without consciousness. We all went to school with children like these. We become numbed by fiction / film / television / news-based reality / invention. Fecks (Dennis Hopper the Great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie. <br /> <br /> There have been few movies sooner or later that measure up to the intelligence of this movie. AMEN. <br /> <br />
