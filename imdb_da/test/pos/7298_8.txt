Okay ... so I'm looking through my mother and father's extensive DVD collection (mostly because they don't charge late fees ;-)) and I come across "A Thousand Acres." I was surprised that here was a movie that had Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a little look of Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I hadn't seen. I don't think I had ever heard of it before. Well, that's exactly the kind of find I dream about, since I have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me. With a few exceptions (None of us can even make them consider watching the Lord of the Rings movie, but my father loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have very similar tastes in movies. <br /> <br /> It was a particularly awful day today, weather. It poured rain all day so I popped into this movie and shortly after I was fascinated. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the very best best sleepers I've seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are BIG in their roles, especially since they play very different types. Jessica Lange's character is a popular supporter, who, despite being a senior child in the family, rarely takes a leading role. Rather, she bends to her father (Jason Robards) and sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is hell of teaching her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong will cancer survivor who is hardly capable of holding anger in her unhappy life contained. This movie is five years before White Oleander, remember, so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong and angry character. I must say that this movie is likely to appeal more to Women. However, true movie buffs who enjoy a movie for whatever it is, regardless of genre or audience, find it hard to deny the charm of this touching drama of family secrets and what they do to the people involved and those who love them. I don't know how I missed seeing this movie before now, but it was probably a good distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!
