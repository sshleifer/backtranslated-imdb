Found a copy in a purchase sale of this old classic. I played it with dosbox on a vista machine with no problems. It's graphically dated, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! The game is an FPS / Adventure game hybrid. That's what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, just turn 360 (think Wolf3D). Game play can be difficult with a very limited supply of health pots and a somewhat average interface (Tip: Press I), but on the whole it is acceptable. <br /> <br /> A main strength of the game is the mood. There is a strong use of full movie, and while the play is b-class and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels really unsafe. It also does a good job of getting you to question the 'good guys'. Do they really help or are they just waiting to get you back? The other big selling point is the game length. There are 18 chapters from the memory that span in playing time from 10 minutes to potential hours. My first play through took me a week with a serious devotion. <br /> <br /> Dated, yes, but if you missed many years ago and can find it for $ 5, give it a look. Cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.
