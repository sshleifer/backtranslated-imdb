Having worked on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (Robin Hood's adventure being their best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for filmography. DEATH WITH YOUR BOOTS ON is their first and best movie together. Raoul Walsh depicts General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debut at West Point, to the Civil War and finally to the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows a heroic portrait of Custer, but that is not important. The important thing is that we are transported with the passion and glory borne by the signs. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching wife Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolic Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal battle remains on this epic and tragic freso.
