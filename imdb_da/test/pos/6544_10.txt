For those of you out there who have seen this picture on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In fact, VHS is completely rubbish. The main reason is that the film was shot widescreen (2.55: 1) and the producers ran out of money to make the VHS version and released it as 4: 3. The result is that more actors are not at all on screen and in many Traction competitions appear less than half of the cars, as one is on either side of the screen. The DVD is actually a fair version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the movie were cut before the final release. They were considered too offensive to minority groups. In fact, the prospect of an American release caused even more cuts in the movie. For example, the Americans apparently did not understand words like gasoline and fighting. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother were supposed to be hippies. The Dad survives in the movie as a wasted dope smoker guitarist. But the following scene with the mother was cut. The scene took place in the house on the roof that was lined with aluminum foil, fluoro light and filled with plants ... you get the picture. The producers had rounded many real plants to the foreground, and when they saw the result on the large sheet, they were freaked and the scene cut. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is known as an Australian cult classic. Voted no. 2 in street machines best 100 movies at all times, smooth out of Mad Max ll. The latter had over 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the budget on the ROE was so small that the director could not afford to destroy any of the cars ... although there would have been a public outbreak if someone had destroyed a genuine HO. (compare it to Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars were destroyed.) <br /> <br /> So there is a real GTHO and two fakes. One of the fakes was purchased from the local native Cobar community after standby GTHO crashed into Land Boy's truck. (It was uscripted! The car was meant to jump out of the side of the truck.) Because the budget was so tight, the car was made of plain brown masking tape instead of the painted gold cladding of the right thing. br /> <br /> 55 chev is completely genuine. The car began as a very clean 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown '55 of the movie. The engine was a marinated 545 which made about 1000 bhp. This was reduced to about 600 for the film. The car could easily reach 170 mph as shown in several scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could have downloaded ALL cars after the movie. HO, Dodge, '53 Out, Rammer's 53 Chev ... party. Wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
