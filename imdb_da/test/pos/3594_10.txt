What I enjoyed most in this movie was Corfu, Greece, I love my country, and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story in the years when Greece struggled to stand on its own two feet through war, Nazi and adversity. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but the times are hard and they have many victims to make. Nicholas Cage looks good in a uniform giving a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. I loved Christian Bale, who played Mandras heroine's man, he looks very good like Greek, his personality matched the Greek patriot! A real fighter in there or what! One of the movies I want to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
