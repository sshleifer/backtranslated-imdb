Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These are the two couples whose lives on addiction, crime, and scab are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest HBO documentary. They are swinging, charming, repulsive, astonishingly stupid and dedicated: to drugs and to each other. They are also each different: Matt is a working class boy who clearly discovers in his understatement while pre-school dropout Tracy supports the Western Union couple money from his moneybags father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic como towards the end of the movie. Meanwhile, widow Michelle (if her hubby died of an NPD) earns her daily bread by publishing as a NYPD vice-cop who was willing to cut that she would be John's deal to avoid prison time, and the sad son's danger Sebastian lives off the proceeds. You will be drawn into their stories and will wish the film to continue for twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this kind, there is no coda that gives us an update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep the Brooklyn apartment? Will Michelle go back to Bellevue for more detox? And can Sebastian become more pathetic? ). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but it may have been the point. Necessary view as long as you are not completely resistant to scenes by people shooting up.
