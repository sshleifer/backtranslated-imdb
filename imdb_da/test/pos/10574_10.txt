It's always hard to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hour movie. I read the book before, and I found the BBC production that deals with this difficulty in the best possible way. The book's qualities have not been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingered patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty where Maud is brought up, the characterization of various social groups in different ways of speaking, the unexpected and Surprising turns of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different on the same scenes when they are first told from Sue's point of view, so from Maud's one. The main players do very well, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very loving love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did with each other because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, author Sarah Waters has thoroughly explored how life was in the British 19th century. While the Tippe Velvet was the world of vaudeville theater and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity, the terrible reality of women's penitentiaries and the fashionable induction of spirits, she shows in Fingersmith the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of people suspected or declared disrupted in asylum cases based on reading sources and scientific research. This is transmitted very well to the film, so the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this movie production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vibrant feelings and excitement.
