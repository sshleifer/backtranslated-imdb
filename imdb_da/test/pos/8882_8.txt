This movie is basically a spear on Hitchcock's Strangers on a train that I thought was overstated anyway. The reason has Danny Devito to see Strangers and then Billy Crystal thinks they will swap murder for Crystal to murder his mother and Devito to murder his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are great, and it's Devito's mother. This is Devito's direct debut and it is better than the war of the roses.
