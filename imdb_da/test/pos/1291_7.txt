"You were going up and you were tripping on a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. It sums up the plot of this story about Leonard (a young Humphrey Bogart) when his dream becomes the sidetrack of bombeshell heir Carol, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and engine company are up and down in this 68 minute shortie. Bogart had not yet developed the quiet, burning style. Good performances by most of the supporting characters - her butler, his colleagues, a sister, interlopers along the way. Some adult themes as it was done just before they really enforced the movie code, but it's still tame compared to what's on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland directed the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
