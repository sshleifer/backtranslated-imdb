An undervalued invisible gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in an exciting, heartbreaking manner, the tension that arises between a son who has been in hell and back and his parents who cannot begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It is not unlike born on July 4, when it is about a soldier's emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam, but while one focused more on post-Vietnam policy (anti-war speeches, etc.), this deals with one much more personal topic: Family. A man's struggle to return to normality after a life-changing experience, and his parents' inability to see the change that has taken place. Estevez delivers a smoldering performance like Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration bubbling beneath the surface. Matching him inches by inch is his real father, Martin Sheen. It is a trip to see these two actions apart, as you get the sense that they are constantly trying to experience each other. It's like the presence of each other inspired the couple to do their best and their performances triumph because of it. Recommended for anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and management. And for any Vietnam war buffer. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
