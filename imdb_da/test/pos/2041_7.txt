<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is another great example of a common passion for many modern films; it starts with a very interesting concept - an educated assassin whose memory was deleted regains self-awareness - and the original setup is engaging, but then it seems that the authors do not know very well where to go next and the whole thing goes Down more and more confusing and / or inane paths, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK, but promised to be much better. Baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even Jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-Pulp Fiction days; It seems that Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, did everything to make sure no one would offset his then wife. Her character is by far the best of the movie, and this fact makes you feel even more frustrated that they couldn't do better with it. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something about this movie that sets me apart from the Hollywood action champion and puts it above average, if only. It's something very subtle, I can't quite put my finger on; It is a disturbing, cold, dark, even sick edge, a nightmare and unreal feeling, a decadent air, a medium stripe that stops in several ways. It is in the dark reddish photograph and almost permanent evening that lives in, it is in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it is in its evil eyes and smiles when she is killing a man or when she announces how she will enjoy seeing her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it's in Mitch's comeback in the car's wheels while he spits so much blood from his mouth that he can barely speak ... I don't know it's an atmosphere something I can't define but which gives me the creeps (a little) and which makes this film still strangely exciting for me.
