Most of this movie is an alternate hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism made at the height of the movement's success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the last minute movie, Chaplin surpasses all that makes art (not to mention comedy) and alters propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most magical and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to emerge from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Never mind that nothing we have seen so far shows that the shave itself is capable of giving the speech we see him give (ironic enough with a disturbing wild-eyed fanatic); Such trivialities must not be allowed to interfere with the Notice.
