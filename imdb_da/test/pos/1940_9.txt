I just looked at another comment written here where the author discusses the disturbing ways teenagers in this movie use the body of their dead friend. One overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of them all, no surprise, this is what crispin glover's character (layne) does. He is excited about one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the murderer's boyfriend. not because layne did not like this person, rather he is enthusiastic about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life and died within a murdered friend being something to be excited about because it gives him something to focus on.
