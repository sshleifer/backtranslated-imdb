They don't make movies like this anymore? Although some may say it's a good thing. Although this was among the first of Disney's PG-rated films, more of the G-movie feeling has shown that their study appeared in the 70s (ie "Freaky Friday", "World's Greatest Athletes") than the PG movie that came out at the beginning of ?? The 80s (ie "Watcher in the Woods", "Tron," "Something Wicked This Way Comes"). Of course, because of Disney's backing, "Midnight Madness" had a huge budget. A large throw and a host of different places go to show it. But zaniness, a madcap scavenger hunt and spectacular visual style were not enough to save the movie from being a huge flop ... An error at the cashier office was most of us introduced to the movie on HBO at the beginning of ?? The 80s, back in the days when the same movies would appear 29 times a week (Oh, wait? They still do!). Essentially HBO did for this movie what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz" ?? they created a tremendously cool audience for a sugary sweet mega-flop .... The biggest problem that makes this a "bad" movie is that there are too many characters and very few of them are flesh out? Eddie Deezen's "squad" doesn't even have names! The blue team, though they are the bad guys, are the most endless and have the most work in their characters (with the exception of the girl who cannot act and does not have enough to do). Harold, perfectly played by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the movie. The second standout character is goof-off Melio, played with tons of charm by now-director Andy Tennant. Although then-Dr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be the star, his character often comes from unpleasant, especially when he is infected with his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. While everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves the movie might disagree that Prince and Fox are the only two characters you really learn about. <br /> <br /> Despite the movie's many flaws and bad actors (most of them fell from the earth's surface after this movie), it still works because the actors seemed to have fun - and fun on the set is similar to fun on the screen. Come on, what college jock is not dreaming of floating around in a beer chamber and what a sweet girl does not dream of stealing the show at the local discotech ... there ... I think it would be in a rave today. .. Campy, creaking-pure fun for anyone who was young in the 70s and 80s, it is only fitting that this has finally got the massive video release it deserves. But where in the hell is the widescreen DVD published with the comment, trailer and the full version of the song playing in the disco?
