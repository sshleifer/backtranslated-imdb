Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is mistakenly accused of sabotaging a hangman making aircraft for the war. He goes on the road, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to court. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is totally displeased in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful, but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make much sense (and rambles longer than necessary); It carries a lot of its patriotism (but it was done while World War II was in full swing) and there is no end. It should not work, but it does. It's full of bizarre lines and signs that definitely hold your interest. For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they are in love with me), "I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane pays a crook to get her lunch and Cummings and Lane join a circus troupe card along the way. Also, Hitchcock's direction was (as always) just amazing - he throws some really amazing shots and sequences - especially the Statue of Liberty climax. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Hitchcock's classic movies but is still very good and worth catching.
