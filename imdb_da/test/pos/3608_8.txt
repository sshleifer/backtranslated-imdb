To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People can't agree, but he does equally well in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was eager to see if she's a good actress. So here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, though). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. All in all, you find the plot quite simple. So the only thing that could save the movie as (an experienced viewer will know from the beginning) would either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was big, big, big !!! In the last part of the film I could even suffer from a sharp accent of the actor (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, it is okay and she even looks like a Greek girl). Overall, the movie is very enjoyable and has a lot of irony (fans of classical music will definitely have fun for a few moments :) <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You should see it!
