This is one of the many techno-phobic movies that sprout like mushrooms in the mid-90s after the internet became commonplace. Hollywood movies have always had their way of "beautifying" the depicted charges to make them look better and more appealing. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show us some high tech. The result of such trials varies from being very removed and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to be quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> The "network" is somewhere between these extremes. By nitpicking one can end up with a lot of technical inconsistencies and many cases where ongoings seem to be much more "sexy" and graphic than the way things are in reality (which usually happens in movies). <br /> <br /> But just by looking at them, the viewer ends with a rather solid, entertaining movie. The characters and the action are convincing, and the film does a good job of keeping you in your place to the end. The reason is okay (a pretty standard one, really - based on the good ol 'paranoiac design, but with a high tech edge this time), and quite convincing (again when ignoring technical issues). However, the development of the plot is a bit sluggish, and in the meantime you can expect some surprising fluctuations in the plot. The bonus here is cutie-pie Sandra Bullock, which besides being sweet (something she makes quite easy, apparently) also depicts a solid act. You can really feel her character - her despair, her feelings. <br /> <br /> In the bottom line, the film is entertaining and interesting, betting around 7 from 10 on my scale. It's worth renting from the video library, or even watching the movie. Whether you want to buy it or not, it's up to you.
