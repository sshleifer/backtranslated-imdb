For the eight people who found the previous FIERCE PEOPLE comments of "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "helpful" as well as for future site visitors who see them before their authors delete them: These negative criticisms are not only shorter than site guidelines mandate, but they are completely fake, non-factual, wrong and misinformative. For example, Blythes father is in coma, NOT dead - Maya and Finn can even visit him in the hospital. In addition, it was Dwayne's manor-damper - NOT Blythe - who beat the Jilly girl, etc. Contract. So if you have ADD that makes you unable to focus on the simplest details, keep your state to yourself by not pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
