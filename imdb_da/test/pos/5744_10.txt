Right, here we go, you have probably read in previous reviews on this movie that it is terrible, badly acted, avoid at all costs. Well, I guess that's true, it's fair to say you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment, as there's no plot to destroy. But there is a fine line between ordinary horrible and absolutely fun and believe me, this movie is the latter. The action is so bad, the plot is so non-existent, and the end so completely confusing it will make you laugh all the way through. There are scenes in this movie that take comedy to a new level. Don't expect an Oscar winner, but trust me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
