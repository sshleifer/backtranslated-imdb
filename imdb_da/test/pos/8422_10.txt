This is a very touching movie. This is a story of a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to get his eyes treated. But come to know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare cancers of the eyes and needs to undergo surgery and will lose both his eyes. The film is about the emotions and the turmoil that both go through and how they accept it all. The film avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the film is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. It turns out to make a good movie, you don't need songs, superstars and ordinary masala. Excellent performances. This is India's admission to Oscars 2004. Hope it will be the least nomination. Would rate 10/10.
