When John Carpenter's masterful version of "The Thing" was released in the summer of 1982, it was hooded by critics and bombed at the box office. The audience could not handle another 'bad' stranger, they wanted ET. Their losses in the long run. <br /> <br /> I wanted to kill to see this amazing movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was far ahead of the time; now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers who show it tracks on things like "Se7en", "Alien 3" and even "The X Files", which uncertainly whipped it from side to side. And the structure that scares character development in favor of incredible SFX is common in today's cracks. <br /> <br /> Carpenter shows the same skills he hit in "Halloween" by using the camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all fine, and the end is fantastic - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
