You have to be careful who you tell about watching 12-hour movies. It can be easy for people to assume that this is a kind of regular event - in fact even in the world of the 'arthouse' cinema, such moms are extremely rare for obvious reasons. This is one thing that Hollywood and the art cinema have in common: The generally accepted 90-120 minute running time, with a minority of films daring to approach, but rarely exceeding the three-hour mark. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a movie like Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardy cinephile, and it goes some way to explaining why it has only been screened on a handful of times and remains extremely hard to find. <br /> <br /> Originally conceived as a television series by maverick Nouvelle Vague director Jacques Rivette, the little interest of the French networks emerged and was settled instead of a short theater run instead (Peter Watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo-documentary The War Game, although it had more to do with state censorship than running time problems). Exhibited a few times in 1971, Out 1 has appeared again on a handful of Rivette retrospects over the past two decades, and many who have seen it, including the renowned American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have praised it as one of the biggest movie of all time. Is that all? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a great 'if', as Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both fantastic), and many are still hard to find on DVD today (Out 1 was only recently available via the Internet after a rare video tape was uploaded). Nevertheless, he is highly respected in the film community and for good reason - his playful surreal stories, sense of pacing and use of improvisation puts him as one of the cinema's most unique and satisfying filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that is found throughout Rivette's work: the nature of acting, especially in connection with theater and improvisation. His fascination with the play makes Rivette's film a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects make it possible for the actors to have a much more active role in determining how the film comes together. Out 1 is roughly divided into four great narratives that are gradually confused and veiled as films evolve: two consisting of acting troops trying to devise postmodern theatrical adaptations of Aeschylus dramas; the two other individual petty thieves (played by Nouvelle Vague icons Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) pursue eccentric methods of making money; and an overall plot with a mysterious balzac-inspired conspiracy centered on an organization known as "thirteen". <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie with a "conspiracy" tale, the mysteries and secret organizations are a little more than a red herring. As the characters are slowly explored and revealed, and their plans and interpersonal connections are broken, the film is increasingly symbolic of post-1968 and the decline of the ideals of the era. For a film made in 1971, these remarkably distinguished themes were; Another French director at Jean Eustache would tackle this issue equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of the scope of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Consists of eight episodes of approximately 90 minutes each (beginning of each episode having a brief, abstract black and white still-montage of events in the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less visible than no quality TV series and can even be better experienced on an episode-to-time basis. This is not to say that it does not remain challenging even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette movies, it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before entering the plot, kind of, and some of the early scenes (especially the sequences depicting the actors' highly abstract exercises) look incredibly long out. These scenes, however, are important, not only as an exploration of improvisational methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a means of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat slender pace of the movie. Paradoxically, long times make long films far more tolerable to an audience, and this understanding of pacing has led Rivette, along with more modern directors such as Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial operating times, yet retaining the capacity to leave viewers excited. <br /> <br /> In a film that is in many ways about, the actor is amazing. Many famous Nouvelle Vague faces appear, including the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, the excellent Michel Lonsdale and Rivette regular Bull Ogier. Yet another legendary director of Eric Rohmer has a great cameo as a Balzac professor who appears in a decisive scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971 seem to have an equally important role - the city's landscapes, crowds and interested spectators freeze out on time, a document of a place at some point in history. <br /> <br /> After just over 720 minutes, the movie ends on an impossible short, enigmatic note; But the exhausting journey that the seer has taken is so full of opportunities, intricacy and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of those people. For those who have seen many kinds of cinema and believe they have seen everything the art form has to offer, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and deviate in so many directions than the current conventions allow. For filmmakers, film critics and artists from all disciplines, this is something to be appreciated.
