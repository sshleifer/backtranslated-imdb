I can't imagine why it has not yet been released theater-wise yet. It has a great ensemble cast, with Sutherland, Lane, and especially Chris Evans doing spectacular work. Wake up, studio execs! The story is based on the experience of the author / scriptwriter, growing up as the "poor child" in an extremely wealthy society, where the class is everything and makes a difference in every aspect of life, from clothing to justice. <br /> <br /> During the film's Q&A, the author was asked about his experiences, and especially what we didn't know about the ultra-fast. He said they are not stupid, they are very clever (as opposed to how they can portray themselves) they have plans, and they are a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is extremely timely.
