I remember a time when the only thing that existed was clubs, drug pubs and parties. This movie came out a few years after I started going to clubbing. If I had never discovered the ravens side of things, this movie may not have made sense to me. That night when I saw it for the first time with some friends, I was completely blown away. I had never seen a movie that hit so close to the reality of where I was in my life at the time. Almost everything I could relate to in one way or another. There was never 1 sign I could fully relate to, but more a combination of them all in one way or another. My friends where there is nothing else and I remember all of them saying they were us or we where they were. We have all been out that weekend together and do exactly what the crew does in HT. We where we came down while we watched and when the movie "came down", I actually remember getting a little longer. It was actually quite depressing in our room under these "low points". It's so good with human traffic. It is a completely unique film in the way it does not plot the drive, but then it is not completely characterized even though the characters are important. It always seemed to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life for his own reasons. But each one reacts to the loss in the same way. Work some work to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. for them their vacation. But the reality is that you can't escape. Another situation they all face. <br /> <br /> Me and my friends are not different from these guys. We all had our own things going. Human traffic helped us explain what we did not understand about ourselves. It does so in a way that does not speak to you. It made us feel that we were not the only ones out there like us, and that the experience of many others from all over the world. It was only until my lifestyle was changed from party budgets to career driven that I fully understood this movie. These days I see HT, now and then (as I have just) and reminiscent of the old days. No other movie can do this. I was peter popper, I was jip travolta, I never went to land with my chosen family. I wanted $ 200 in my back burner and I wax a lot! No problems!
