This year's royal rumble was not really bad, but last year was certainly much better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Although this match took a little too long, it was still okay. Edge wins after using the ropes to pin Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> OTHER MATCH SIGNS VS. HEIDENREICH IN A QUALITY MATCH Now I don't like Casket matches. This fight was boring and sloppy, but eventually it picked up as Undertaker nailed the tombstone and rolled Heidenreich into the coffin of victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH-JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. BIG SHOW IN A TRIPLE-THREAT MATCH FOR WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad triple threat fight. Too bad, JBL wins again to keep his title after nailing a Clothesline From Hell on Angle to victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH-RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP Fantastic match of these two men, the fight was a bit sloppy, but it was still good, and it got pretty close to the end. Although Orton lost the match was quick and good towards the end. HHH nails the pedigree of Orton to win to keep his world title. 5/10 <br /> FIFTH MATCH-ROYAL RUMBLE This was a cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After all 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars were in Rumble Cena, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to spear out Mysterio, later Batista & Cena stretched the Edge together. It was now up to Cena & Batista. Only after turning an F-U, Batista went to the Batista Bomb, but suddenly both men crumbled on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision, Mr. McMahon makes his way to the ring to resolve the matter. The fight was restarted again when Batista & Cena knocked it out, but Batista got better out of Cena, nailed a spine and threw Cena out to win Royal Rumble in 2005 and move on to Wrestlemania 21 to meet Champion in mainevent. 10/10 This was a very good Royal Rumble but last year always wanted the top of all Royal Rumble in history. Overall: I give it 8/10 & B +
