Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller was found beaten and <br /> <br /> raped in the opening scene of this made for television films. The movie <br /> <br /> flashbacks for the few days before rape, as Beller is harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and <br /> <br /> Dennis Quaid is double dating early. Beller's anxious parents, <br /> <br /> added Tony Bill and shrill Blythe Danner back, waiting at home and twisting hands and so on. Immediately, the 1970s make their dated entry as the young couples discuss romance and love in <br /> "Three days in Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, is starting to get threatening notes <br /> <br /> filled in her closet at school. The film authorities wisely give us a complete suspicion of suspect: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattsons <br /> <br /> boyfriend, Beller's father, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about it <br /> <br /> too friendly photography class teacher who wants Beller to be a <br /> <br /> more sexy in his self-portraits? I knew who the rape was <br /> <br /> because the video box Worldvision Video Company has an image of <br /> <br /> attacked on the back and destroys any tension in it <br /> <br /> << br /> <br /> Without giving away who the attacker is, Beller is starting to get harassed phone calls and is eventually raped. The movie then <br /> <br /> heads south as she does as Nancy Drew and secretly sets up <br /> <br /> a time card camera to catch the guy stalking another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmaker strikes a hokey ending tale from <br /> <br /> calling for the lack of understanding of victims of rape in it <br /> <br /> day and age. <br /> <br /> The excitement here is very real, without going over the top in <br /> <br /> scary movie stuff. Cells are very good and take care of her and <br /> <br /> Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater - both do good jobs. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. <br /> <br /> This was made in 1978 and it shows. I'm sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by a supercritical horror <br /> <br /> movie lover to get to bed and get up early in <br /> <br /> morning, but some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. The <br /> <br /> teacher who tells Beller to be sexy is never made to explain what he has just thought of. Today, if any high school teacher said so, it would have been made for television movies alone. After Beller was raped, the rape is still a part of her life as warrants <br /> <br /> are issued, blah, blah, blah. This may not be the case because Beller is not a virgin and cannot prove that she was raped by whom <br /> <br /> she said. Many of these issues have been addressed with <br /> <br /> modern technology and police efforts, but this movie knew clearly that it would have a chance to add to the reform debate. Rape is an act of violence that has not gone away, but efforts today to capture the attackers are miles ahead twenty-four years ago. The problem <br /> <br /> is that the rape angle feels adhered to as an afterthought. Before that, we have a tight little suspend that has real honesty to God's characterization. After rape everything changes <br /> <br />, film-wise and not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> her revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she hasn't done anything in < br /> <br /> almost ten years. This is a shame as she was very good way <br /> <br /> then. <br /> <br /> I would recommend "Are you alone in the house?!" based on <br /> <br /> acting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the <br /> <br /> movie. If you want to revive the 1970s made for television in high school, this is your cup Tab. <br /> <br /> This is not classified but contains physical violence, some sexual <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations.
