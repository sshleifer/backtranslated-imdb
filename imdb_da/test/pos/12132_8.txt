Surprisingly good "Mean Streets" -type crime drama. Foreshadows items of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Joe Pesci's first major role. Smart dialogue. I think the Maltin guide gives this a bomb rating. I can only guess that nobody actually bothered to see it. <br /> <br /> Looked at Tarantino's film festival, he said Scorsese used a number of these actors in Raging Bull.
