I classify this movie on a curve, in other words, it's not the biggest movie ever made, but it does exactly what it aims to do. This is an excellent T & A movie. I have no idea how many T's or A's were seen in this movie, but I saw a shot that had 16 just T's at once, just to give you an idea. There are topless girls throughout. There is a wet T-shirt competition scene. And the climax involves a football game between two all-girl teams and each time you score a touchdown, the entire opposite team loses a piece of clothing. I don't know why it gets such a low rating here. Perhaps the people who gave the low score thought they should see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find more similar. If you are looking for a good campy T & A movie, I would recommend this one.
