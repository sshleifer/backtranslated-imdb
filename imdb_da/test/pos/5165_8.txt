I've already seen the spin-offs of comics like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes, and most of them are great. When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how Rugrats would look in their pre-teens / teens and it contained things that would normally happen during this lifetime, like going on a concert, go to school and be founded. The actual TV show is better because Rugrats seems to wear different clothes in each episode, and Angelica is not penalized as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are being punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how Rugrats looked in the original series. They actually talk to the adults in this show because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show like this.
