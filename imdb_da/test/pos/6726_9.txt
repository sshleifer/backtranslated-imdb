Good to see, I'm not the only person to remember this amazing movie. I have very good memories of this movie - seems to vaguely remember back when I was about 8 and I wanted to watch the kids TV shows after school (Broom Cupboard anyone?). This was the first and last movie to scare me - and the pictures of the boy surrounded by fog on a hill will stay with me forever! Like most movies in this era, it has a happy end - aimed at children, but with a certain ability to catch an adult's attention. The lovely Cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I would like to try to find this movie again - see if it still hits home!
