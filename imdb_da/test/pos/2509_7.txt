And on and on the letter goes. But in truth, George may have the eyes of Helen and Jennifer have been hard on Johnny. The city's museum consultant can also have a secret love. Will tame things like these ever stand out? This is a cute movie with a beautiful setting and skillful stars. Each of the main players provides a pleasant performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to the aforementioned. The coastal landscape is also great, the costumes are quite well-chosen, and the photography is very nice.

But for those who love romantic comedies, this should be included on a list of good choices for the genre.
