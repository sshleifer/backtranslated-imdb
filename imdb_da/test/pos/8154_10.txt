I watched this movie on LOGO TV today. I was absolutely thrilled by the powerful messages and plot line in this movie. I don't want to spoil it. I want to say this, I related to Aaron's inner struggle and his upbringing. As a gay man grew up in a small town, I related so well to the "great secret" and the choices I made. This movie has made a huge impact on me and I plan to buy a copy of it in the near future for my personal library. I made no more than the movie and started calling my friends to recommend it. It had a profound effect on me. For those who read this comment. See it. Try to get as little distraction as possible. Also, keep an open mind. This is not a movie that can be seen as a Disney movie or movie this week. Instead, take the time to look and actively LISTEN to the dialog and read between the lines and get involved in the plot. You can find yourself in tears. Not since "Steel Magnolias" I have been moved to tears by a movie. This one did just that. Thanks to the player and the author and crew for producing an emotional romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It's been a long time since.
