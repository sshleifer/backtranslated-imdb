This movie was exciting and fun to watch. Since I am a fan of this type of movie, I enjoy it here. The premise is a bit scary, but the fact that I did not rate this was 10 because the movie was a bit over the top in some areas. SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NO could identify this girl? I understand the idea of ​​isolating herself, but I find it hard to believe that SOMEBODY-ANYBODY would not have been able to identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was over the top and so was the scene where she went over to a person's desk and started writing. This was generally a really good movie, exciting and keeps your interest. Dennis Miller was great as Allen, really trustworthy, Bullock was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the evil all underrated. <br /> <br /> I think the PREMISE of the movie was really different and scary. In the present-day who knows what could happen? But some of the over-the-scenes prevented this movie from being a 10. 8 out of 10.
