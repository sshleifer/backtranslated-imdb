I'm no Ebert. What I am compassionate, and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I don't give a criticism, but I see nothing but perfection in this movie. I'm sure many who see this movie will never see the same things I do, but if you look hard enough, you might see something you didn't expect. I read that Leland's character was flawless. It seems to me that who wrote this could not look beyond the question this film presents. I'm sorry for someone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers. Open your heart more than your mind, and you might let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that really has a meaning. Exceptional story with extraordinary plays. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
