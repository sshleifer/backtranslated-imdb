I'm still waiting this year for a new DVD version of this amazing movie. I own a beta max recording with French language. Unfortunately, MGM excludes the French track on its latest DVD ... Only English spoken a French subtitle ... I don't know how MGM should be advised: I wrote emails to them, but of course no answer. If I insist, it is because the double track in French was exceptionally spectacular, fun, well-written, etc. George C. Scott is always outstanding and for people born like me in the 50s Diana Rigg represents something much more than Madonna ( e.g). Thank you for your help ... Sincerely ...
