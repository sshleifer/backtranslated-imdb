Loved this movie! Kicking the old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the lyrics. I really really really loved Geeks! I was excited to see the stupid slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was just like my favs as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you're a big fan of scary and stupid then it's your movie! Only taken by a star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound, but wanted more. Big blood splatters. Big murder weapons. Great costumes! I really love the node for the big 80's teen stereotype ala breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI excitement. Really good camera action and light excitement instead of cutting to CGI. I'd rather have good fake that really fake false. Kisses to cast and decision makers! oh also loved "making-of"!
