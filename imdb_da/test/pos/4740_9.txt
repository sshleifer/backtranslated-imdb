There have been many documentaries that I have seen where it turned out that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise lost first and foremost. But it's the first movie that made me look with anger after I saw it. It seems obvious to me from the evidence presented in this movie that what happened in Waco at least was an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the FBI and AFI's side and at least an act of murder. Like most people when the coating by Waco appeared, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil man who led a violent cult. Having seen this, I think that Koresh was probably a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who unfortunately got the attention of US governments through his eccentric actions. Well, there were plenty of weapons on the Branch Davidian composition. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video recordings of the people inside the composition, which everyone seemed to be very nice and harmless. And it was anger to see the wise testimony of the men responsible for the government forces on the Waco site, the clever testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the Waco attack, a defense led by some of the committee's democrats. Standing out in my mind was NY representative and current US senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I was living in the NY state - I am a democrat who is also quite leaning. After seeing his actions at this committee, I wish I could come back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For all the remote interested in the government, this is a very crucial movie, a must see. I even think this should be shown in classes - it's so important.
