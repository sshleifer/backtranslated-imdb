DO NOT TROLL A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story line, better ...) movies - and while it's not the typical "carnage" that Fulci is known for, it's still a very unique and fun movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a number of child murders occur. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects or those who "help" with the investigation (or in some cases both) - include police city forces, a small journalist, a beautiful and rich ex-addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped urban man and a deaf / dumb girl. All these people are interwoven into the plot to create more twists until the actual killer is revealed ... DO NOT INTERPRET A DUCKLING is neither a "classic" giallo or a typical Fulci gore movie. Although it contains elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery with a darker subject and a few scenes of graphic violence (though nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well-written film with lots of phrases that kept me guessing until the end. Recommended for fans of giallo / murder mystery, or anyone who wants to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter movies - but don't worry, TORTURE doesn't have more than a fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be discouraged by the child's killing, and a head woman has a strange habit of hitting very small boys, which is also a little disturbing - but if that kind of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this a look. 8.5 / 10
