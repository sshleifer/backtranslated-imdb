I really enjoyed this movie. I've probably seen it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old marine guy, I'm still touched by the bursting rendering of Anchors Away! I also love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer, but I'm just old-fashioned I think. She was still good at looking, lol, espesially after the crew finished her laundry. The chef, sonman and electrician made the film. Loved the blessed old engineer and his first class PO too. And Grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer. I loved the "driving scene" as they passed the golf course into the harbor, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was like the little tissue ... I'm so glad this is out on DVD, about bloody time. : 0)
