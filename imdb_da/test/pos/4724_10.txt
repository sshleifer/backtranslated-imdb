Never had I seen such a strong sand movie. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel laureate thanks to this masterpiece in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson of courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen anything so good since. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
