Excellent performance by Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. Superb story that brings you into the movie, emotional, yet easy. I own this movie and everyone I have shared it loves. Perfect for mixed company, 18+ crowd. <br /> <br /> Nice production, not a cheap budget, well organized and keeps your interest. Uses couplers newer ideas for flashbacks and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat. No matter what turn in life a viewer is off, they will buy into one or more views in this movie. <br /> <br /> Would love to see a sequel!
