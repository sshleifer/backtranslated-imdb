Apparently takes place in the 1940s, just after the Second World War. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) completes his job to get a chance to "make a difference" in the bombed-out war Europe. He packs a book from his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and starts on a trip that will eventually prove Witgenstein's famous statement true: Nothing is what it looks like. There are two main types and several subplots for this film, which takes place on a train tied to Berlin. Author / director Peter Dalle (also plays the role of the train leader) has gathered an impressive cast, including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, GÃ¶sta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. All in all, the play is excellent. Apparently offers some pretty twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor (like the nun that loses its faith and begins to curse violently). It is as if the Kitten gang meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) in Schindler's List. I laughed for most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning I laughed even more. An intelligent movie for fans of Swedish comedy.
