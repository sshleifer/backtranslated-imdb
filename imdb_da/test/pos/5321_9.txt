I noticed that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I think this diagnosis is obvious and deeply wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a film of sadness and of a particular teenager's ability to see sadness in daily life, as it lies in the wait of every corner, prior to the unfolding of the lives it affects. A sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others, and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject that places itself in the middle of the subject's universe, with complete disregard of the effect of the subject's actions on those around him or her. One of the sociopathic defining properties is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy - lacks the ability to feel what others feel, and does not correlate changes in other people's moods due to the actions of the sociopathic actions with them. A sociopath may NOT feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopathy's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. A vital chunk lacks from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath, which makes the sociopath immune to "speech therapy" and other therapies involving human interaction and exploration of personal emotions. Sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment with the purpose of containing the harm that sociopaths can do to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never put a blip on the radar in the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trace of emotional waste in their wake. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to predict what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcome of human interactions. Leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalises the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that to have a better Metaphor, things fall apart. People who fall in love and who kiss and jaw today become "pathetic" older couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a wealthy New York socialite who loves Leland and who invites him into the home, she shares with her family when he arrives in New York City alone and determined to stay in the city by 12 years old, as she explains to him on the last of his visits to New York City, she learned that her husband had been cheated with her all the time that she was divorced and that such a loss is inevitable part of the adult up. Her eyes still reflect light, but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone. This scene - this explanation is late, it's about to come - is crucial to understanding why Leland commits an apparently wild, meaningless crime (killing his ex-love's late younger brother). Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy - a lifetime of unattainable goals, being taught only words that denote danger, never knowing love for another human being, never feeling such love and never connecting with another person . More than any other character in this movie, this little boy personifies all that Leland sees as inevitable and horrifying all over the world. Leland's action - killing this little boy - is a mercy for Leland because it was the only thing he could do in a world where actions cannot change outcomes. While a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes, but do not care about the damage that other actions cause by these actions, Leland worries. What most people see as a barbaric and horrible act is in Leland's eyes the only decent thing he can do to relieve the suffering of the only person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions - comforting, but incomplete. For, in the end, "guilt" lies for Leland's actions elsewhere. As it is so often, there are no easy explanations and no conditioner to apply to the furious soul. Why did Leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge - that sometimes - sometimes sometimes - people remain in love and that relationships succeed and even the shameful lives are transformed? For Leland there is no middle, no inner core that he can retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sorrow. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father - the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - not to be there at critical times during Leland's development, but given that man's panty nastiness, it may have been a blessing. br /> <br /> Eventually, this viewer was moved by a huge sense of grief. Why was Leland convicted of seeing the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity to Leland's character - present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one should be because his girlfriend breaks up with him - it is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, because it is completely genuine, despite Leland's teachers' encouraged repeal. But heartbreaking, being born not so much of understanding as of despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is just a reflection of the complete certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing that he does can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> This is not sociopathy on the screen. This is, if anything, its polar opposite ......
