I have to do this short and sweet. It's not surprising that you didn't need this movie. This is a story of power, beauty and the potential of a meaningful education. Based on your pathetic composite comments, I can see that your own education has been severely neglected ... or worse ... totally wasted. Your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. I would advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case, I feel enough late. I hope you do not intend to enter the teaching profession (especially in film studies) because you could only do harm. Oh ... a last bit of advice. In the future, if you intend to write more opinions, you really need to proofread your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
