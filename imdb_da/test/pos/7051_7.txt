The reason is predictable. It has been done many times in other films. You have competing summer camps in this one: the rich children vs underachievers compete for "bragging" rights in the typical camp competitions while the kids and consoles pursue pranks, sex and "a good time!" "Are you ready for the summer?" Meatballs are the first (and best) summer camp movie for an emotional comedy. As others have written, it's not Citizen Kane, but this type of movie isn't supposed to be. The movie works because of Bill Murray's wonderful cartoon and classic one-liners. His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the child's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the movie are very fun. <br /> <br /> I also think this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other "teenagers in camp" movies today. There is something mildly sexual induendo and maybe one or two cuss words throughout the movie. But meatballs are the kind of teen movie that really suits the younger crowd. It is classified PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch a few times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or does one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are drawn to the movie. Bill seems to carry the movie all alone. But he does so well that when you see Meatballs, you will realize that this is the movie that made him a star! One side note for this review is to avoid ALL of the Meatball movie sequels. They are terribly bad.
