She's the man was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard that I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely beautiful and can really work. It doesn't hurt that he also has a lot of shirtless scenes. Channing and Amanda have great chemistry and were wonderful together. I love this movie. When you see, be sure to see the last deleted scene. Cutting that scene was a big mistake because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been more fun. And Channing becomes a big star. This is only the first of many to this bright new star.
