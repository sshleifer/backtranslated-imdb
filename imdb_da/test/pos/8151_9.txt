I love a sweet hearted movie with a good ending. This movie can be considered a drama with two characters that realizes true love, but the story is so touching and so sweet that in my mind is a romance. Permitted, the play is not that big (it was yi, it didn't give it 10), but they do the job and they don't take over (god) and they are cute but the story is powerful and simply adorable some of you pansies will choke ) !!!!!! It's a good look at a love story, but if you're homophobic, stay away! For everyone else, I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I felt a brokeback on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so enjoy !!
