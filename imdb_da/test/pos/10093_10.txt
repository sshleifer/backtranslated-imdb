If you consider yourself a horror movie fan, you have the chance to see Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are amazing, and Ring makes its way to Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will also be customized soon?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heart pusher and nerve break, a narrative of two sisters is both nerve-wracking and sensuous. <br /> <br /> Along with The Other, I consider this Korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie. The only flaw this movie has is some are considering its first 20 minutes rather slowly. It is typically typical of Korean and Japanese films. I consider it carefully planned rather than slow, think of it as "quiet moment before the storm". With thorough introduction of characters, imho viewer will become more intimate with the character, one of Korean and Japanese film's strongest points. <br /> <br /> As a ring, a story of two sisters does not exaggerate terribly. Rather, they even make us the scary job themselves. In this way, it is frightening and horrific classic at the same time. I won't be surprised if Hollywood recovers this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On over (This flick is not so good by the way, I rate it 5.5). Do not miss it!
