ABC's version of the late Pope's life: They put it slightly in front of CBS's version, and it may have a bit of it, but the program itself was excellent. It moved quickly as it only had two hours (with advertising also taken time) to cover the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann was admirable. He did a remarkable job in conveying the feelings and strife that John Paul ended. He - unlike CBS biopic - played the role of youth to old age and managed to seem "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility was never angry. He has a fantastic reach and depth. It's a shame that the program couldn't have been longer and more detailed, but working within the timeframe they had, I think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen.
