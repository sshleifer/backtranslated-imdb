When I saw that this movie was broadcast on sennat tv, I first decided to give it a miss. I'm glad I then started to see. Yes the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet theater. Some of the actors / actors are from his other productions, of course he used the same composer later as the Ostean soundtrack could only come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend. Get rid of all that and you have a movie that shows exciting opportunities. Is there a planet on the far side of the sun? Is it a double ground? Is everything about it turned around and in that case they speak English the other way around? I love this dated SF if it's only for Gerry's wonderful model cars, planes, buildings, and spaceships. Some of them have not been collected so far, when they thought so. And did you see the European Space Center logo? Much reminds of the Euro logo today. Suspend faith and spend a few hours seeing this, you'll be glad you did.
