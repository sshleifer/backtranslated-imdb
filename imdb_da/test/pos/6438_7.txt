Like many, I first saw The Water Babies as a child / young teen at the end of the 70s / early 80s. It has been with me since then with its captivating melodies, memorable depictions, less successful animation and a story full of heart, cold and ultimately good vanquishing evil. Recently, I sat down and saw it again after at least two decades, and this time I noticed about its striking similarities with The Wizard of Oz. No, they are not blatant pictures, but hear me out. In this one we have a boy and his dog - have personal problems in the home, running away from something and in the scene right after they run away and change the substance of their appearance. In one, the boy and the dog are animated. In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are color. In this, the boy and the dog are told that they should answer the water children and then eventually Cracken as a guide and he has the ability to let Tom go home if he shows that he has courage etc ... In The Wizard Of Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative character who tests her before giving her the opportunity to return home. In the water children, Tom meets three characters who will help him on his journey to the water children - Dorothy also has three helpers. When each helper is fulfilled, we are entertained with a rendering of "Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, HI Cockallorum ... We are on our way." In the guide it is "We are out to see the guide." Dorothy has a good witch kind of after her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) doing the same. If you look closely at the two, there are many other pictures. That said, The Water Babies are not a knockoff in any way, I just comment on the creepy likes between the two. This movie has some solid performances from evil Bernard Cribbins and the always fascinating James Mason. The children playing Tom and Ella are good. The supportive cast of Joan Greenwood (loves her voice!), David Tomlinson, and the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival add a lot to the mix. I must admit that the animation is less than sterling even for its time, but is sufficient enough for the challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom come home are all sympathetic. I always have trouble choosing my favorite between the French swordfish and John Inman / Mr. Humphries like seahorse. The scene where we hear this guttural, scary laugh from a shipwrecked ship to see a seahorse with a large polka-dotted bow-bob out, always has me rolling! The Water Babies are very fun. Sure, it's more of a children's movie, but it has and must always have a huge place in my heart. Most of the credit for what successes the movie has to go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout.
