This western's title role is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He is a young gun that, together with partner David Carradine, is separated after making a contractual strain on a Mexican general. By eliminating their persecutors, Carradine and Walker are separated. Walker arrives at the camp of lawyer Robert Mitchum who enjoys Walker and makes him a protégé and sort of recycling project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with author / director Burt Kennedy. The other was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that Young Billy Young doesn't have his hilarious moments. But it's a tripartite story involving the Walker Recovery, Mitchum's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle with Mitchum, Angie Dickinson, and the city's chief Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The film is bound by nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martin's daughter Deana is in this, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris plays Mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum got started in Western and always looks right at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a short career playing rebellious youth and doing a good job on it. I have often wondered what happened to him. He looks jokingly like his father. Perhaps he would not come to such a tragic early end as his father. <br /> <br /> And it wasn't enough, Mitchum fans hear old spatial eyes singing the title song at the beginning of the movie.
