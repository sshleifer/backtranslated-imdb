If you are a film student, or were one, or are thinking of becoming one, have the word Battleship Potemkin or want a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other clear film pioneers like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffiths) and Murnau, have had such an impact on the history of the cinema, it is obviously taken for granted. The reason I take film students is that at some point, whether you like it or not, your movie professor will 9 times out of 10 show the "Odessa Traps" sequence of this movie. It is hard to say whether it is even the "best" part of the movie's several sequences dealing with (then-current) times in the Russian Revolution. But it gives the greatest effect, and it can be seen in many films that show excitement or simple montage (The Untouchables' climax comes to mind). Assembly, which was not only Eistenstein's knack, but also his life's blood early in his career, is often abused in the current cinema, or if he is not abused in an erroneous connection to history. Sometimes mounting is now used as just another unit to get from point A to point B. Assembly was something else for Eisenstein; he tried to communicate in the most direct way that he could urgency, passion (s) and the ultimate tragedies that were in the Russian people at that time and place. Although you can't see all of Eisenstones' stories or traditional 'stories' ideas of having much grounding (Kubrick has said this), one cannot deny the power to see the ships arriving at the port, the people on the stairs, and the soldiers coming to them each only way with guns. Some may find it hard to believe that this was done in the 20s; It has the power of Joan of Arc's passion to exceed its time and remain in importance only in terms of technology and feeling. Of course, one can continue with books (which have been written hundreds of times, not least by Eisenstein himself). On the film itself, the Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized news tour than a particular story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the major sequences in films that a myth is plotted against the captain and other head-ups of a particular ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative manner, but in a way extremely efficient; mounting is also used here, but at the tips of energy that catches the eye. Other times, Eisenstein is more content to let the pictures speak for themselves, as the soldiers get tired without food and water. He is not one of the directors who will try to get all sides to the story; He is of course very early in the 20th century Russian, but he is nothing but honest with how he sees his themes and style, and that is what ultimately wins. <br /> <br /> Some may want to check it out of the film school, as the "staircase" sequence is one of those landmarks of serious tragedy on movies showing the ugly side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more accessible 'song movie directors', but if montage, frame details, non-actors, and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it is truly one of the ways of life.
