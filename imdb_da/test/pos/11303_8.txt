For once a Barbie movie that is good. I'm 18 and am embarrassed to say this, but I'm hooked on these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I fall in love with him. He is as cute as polar bear and completely in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika determination not to give up on hope and it seems like it works. I love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to kids of all ages (even boys) because the movie is so good and I am hard to please. Barbie and Magic of Pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.
