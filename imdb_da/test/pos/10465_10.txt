This is one of the movies that gets better with each view. I saw it three times and actually registered on IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. Movies about "food" have been made before, some of them are really good - such as a certain Japanese comedy, as aficionados of Asian cinema anyway. But this one is really in its own league. The core is a Protestant Christian parable which symbolizes the idea of ​​kindness, but far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" of each and every one of us, regardless of our religious belief or lack thereof. There is a pervasive understatement and refinement in Babette's feast, but it makes the movie's message, somewhat stronger, not at all weaker. If you cannot attend Babette's extraordinary physical banquet, you are still welcome to this party of the soul. Highly recommended !!
