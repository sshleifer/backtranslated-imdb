Just gone on YouTube and finally watched this Oscar nominated animated card directed by Richard Condie. I had previously seen his fun get started there. In this, a pair plays Scrabble. The wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but E on his side. The wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub (!) Before she catches her husband and looks at her side. Shortly before this, the man takes a TV show called "Sawing for Teens" with the stars looking something and the man gets his own saw. This program is interrupted by a special report on a nuclear war that happens (the new man is a skeleton here), who all panic around, even though the man fell asleep during this time, and believes that a parade is going on when he and his wife continues to argue for the game ... There are lots of other bizarre things going on before the touching end comes on. Absolutely fun and worth watching for any animation buff out there. Can't wait to see more animated shorts from Mr. Condie ...
