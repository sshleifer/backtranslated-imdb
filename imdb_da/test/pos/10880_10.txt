This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I've played many different first-person shooters and I've never really liked any of them much, but this game has a certain thing that I can't put my finger on, making it a great fun. Maybe it's the extraordinary detail of the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's James Bond's suave character. Whatever it is, this game never seems to be old no matter how many times I've played it.
