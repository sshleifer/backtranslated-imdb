I first saw this mini-series as a child, and although I am not a child, I still love it !!! Professional copies are hard to find, but when on DVD, it is MY !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great casting, amazing plots, and lots of action, romance and even a bit of well-placed comedy. I'm not a historian of nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
