Outstanding little movie that steals Mary Astor as a go-getter working up like a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for employees to buy the company with a dunk the seller (Robert Ames) as the "front", even though she is the brain. Of course, he will be a great success and she will be his managing secretary, who still runs everything and teaches the class. She loves dope, but he never catches up when he fools around with a bimbos string. She is hunted by a married but separate man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a society beats Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just amazing as the prudent woman who almost makes a big mistake after she loses her husband. Ames is good as shaking (but what does she see in him?), And Cortez is good, but doesn't have much to do. Kitty Kelly is good as a sidekick, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the social child, and Edna Murphy is fun as Daisy. Worth seeing.
