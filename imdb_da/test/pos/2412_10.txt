THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked great in their prom dress. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bullying. That's because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a clean one ******! It was because he was a very hard man who would not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and showdown between Julie and Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to anyone who likes martial arts flicks or is fans of Hilary Swank.
