All that Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very twisted to a minimum. Well, something that is not, I am at least a cyborg. Park's latest movie titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic thriller-dark comedy drama ?? yes there are many adjectives ?? inspired by the French novel from the 19th century by Emile Zola named Therese Raquin. Park creates a unique Korean and unique Park, vision for vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore a Catholic priest's dilemma that discovers that he has a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. Park delivers on the items you would hope for, but certainly lacks masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Heavily inflated with a tale that often loses much less audience, thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. It crawls when it needs to run, but fortunately it brings home again before losing the audience altogether. As negative as it may sound, the positives outweigh the negatives, and there has undoubtedly been added another volume to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chan-wook movie. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
