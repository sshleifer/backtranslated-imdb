Beguiled is a beautiful satisfying movie for those who are after the above things. For Clint Eastwood's lethal fans it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his so-atypical role (except that his character is a charming womanizer with whom he is not so unfamiliar), his ambiguous character, which goes from being a kind of fall to a manipulating and insatiable Woman's seats (to put it this way) will ultimately be too much for anyone who used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition, morally a little unclean, but still without the dark side. I think he is able to pull this unlikely part, but those who really steal the show are the two rival women, the schoolmaster Geraldine Page and the student leader of Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the sweetest, most innocent girl in the world until she is pampered with John McBurney and becomes the owner of him. This is causing tragedy, as well as the headmistress's secret desire, the forbidden fruit. She carries a big and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, which she still obviously idolizes. The fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who lures John away from his hug at Edwina and into his bed. <br /> <br /> The whole character of history gives this movie a kind of Gothic feel, making it a rather rare thing in the Western genre, but a popular thing in the 70s movies. A unique performance by the Siegel / Eastwood team and a film that is not too weak.
