"Pitch Black" was a complete shock to me when I first saw it back in 2000. In previous years I was repeatedly disappointed with all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought this movie would not be different. But to put it plainly, this movie freaked me out ... in a good way. I didn't realize I was still afraid of the dark until I saw this movie; I must have buried my fear behind my subconscious when I was a child and it just deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> The alien creatures shook their backs; The person or people who have designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved how the authors gave each protagonist a story and showed their mistakes and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> Riddick's (Vin Diesel) gift to get out of an impossible situation and to put a hell of a fight was jaws. At first, you expect him to be a cold intelligent villain, but for a few moments you can see something human behind his animal side. But as soon as you discover it, he makes something incredibly incredible. He definitely intends to guess right up to the end. I didn't know if he was to despise or admire him ... he's certainly a love / hate type character. John's (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character who sets a good front but through a need for greed shows his true intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's knack of knowing which buttons to press and the right words to say makes him so rude as Riddick. Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character that Johns so nicely expressed, looking at her own ass first before considering the consequences. But what is related to her is that she quickly discovers the errors in her ways and desperately tries to pay fines even though she threatens her life when others discard all human values ​​and went to the dark hills that run. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted a hero and was the first out of the whole group to look for it all in Riddick; Through a child's eye one can see well through the evil thick clouds. I thought it was absolutely invaluable when Jack shaved his head in ode to Riddick; You know what they say: Imitation is the best kind of flattery. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to look good in some evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships he encounters, and when time permits, he rationally robs his losses and then soldiers. In a sense, he served as a moral enhancer to the survivors, although most characters seemed to be listening. The casting for this film was positively perfect. Each actor clearly shone in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie may have had a small budget, but the director's management and actors performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive Special Effects do all the work for them . This movie is a specific Sci-Fi classic. See it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be well worth it.
