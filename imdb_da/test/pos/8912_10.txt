Alien Warrior (or King of the Streets) is one of the 80s gems you stumbled upon by mistake, so watch awestruck, wondering how wonderfully silly and over the top. <br /> <br /> A pretty hunky alien arrives on the ground (LA to be precise) and stumbles into a world of drug dealers, gang and corrupt police. He falls in love with the hairy, beautiful teacher who only wants to help the children in inner city to read more. He also manages to anger a cola-snorting drug kingpin that promises to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie at first sight ... sure it's hokey, silly and low budget. But you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place and the hell if it didn't work! I only ask it to come soon on DVD. It has a hot soundtrack, break-dancing, violence, nudity .... all with a positive, healthy message! See it.
