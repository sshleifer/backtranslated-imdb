You got it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the movie, even in the beginning when they were on their way to California. His mother knew about Bobby and didn't deter Mike, who leaned on Bobby, as imaginary friends are in common with young children. Therefore, they both had abdominal pain at the same time. Therefore, the boys were so dense. <br /> <br /> At the end, Mike was letting Bobby go. The king was arrested. Mike could continue without Bobby. That's why Mike's mother didn't seem disturbed when Mike received the postcard (Mike had written and sent) from the Bobby Ol 'West tourist stop and the other postcards from around the world. You have noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark. What a great mother does the best she could in the late 60s. A 9 out of 10 for me. Bringing back memories ...
