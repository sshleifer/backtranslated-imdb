When this movie came out in 1995, I found it incredibly amazing. Especially with Sandra Bullock. Having seen her amazing performance in Speed, I was ready to enjoy some of her movies. Back to The Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspension. All in all, I enjoyed it so I give it a **** out of *****.
