This performance leaves you without desire. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it is breathtaking. We only got the cheap tickets far back, but still had a view of everything that happened. If you ever get the chance to see this live then go! It's worth the trip, and if I were you, I'd wait a half hour after the show to 'cool down'. The performances are breathtaking and around the tent there are colorful dressed performers who are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent alive. The music - live music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought a DVD later, but the show, which was filmed, had less colorful costumes. It is the atmosphere of the tent that sweeps you from your feet. A great trip for both old and young, and also a great movie
