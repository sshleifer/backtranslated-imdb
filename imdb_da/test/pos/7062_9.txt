I caught this on TV one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s there was a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be fun, so it was a nice surprise. It is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the final summer camp committee, thanks to Murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. This is the movie that really got Ivan Reitman noticed as an instructor. With this film, Reitman proves that he is one of the most talented comedy directors all the time. While this movie is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it is fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
