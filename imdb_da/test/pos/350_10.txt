Since 1981, Nintendo has made amazing video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would be a bit dull after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to be boring because they always add something new. It went from slot machines to Wii and I hear there's a new version of Wii scheduled for release in 2011. What makes Wii games so different is the fact that you actually do something instead of just sit on the sofa and press buttons. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
