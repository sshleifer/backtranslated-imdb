Apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at one and the same time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this movie is absolutely top class. Everything is accurate. That is the point I believe from the uniforms to horror and disillusionment. Everyone is as gray as the field gray uniforms. Gray men with life exhausted by them. Forget the US made Gung Ho waste like Blackhawk down and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies ever. Only Iron Cross beats this for excitement and history. Can we have a proper Un-dubbed German language with English subtitle version in the UK? Without having to pay ridiculous import duties from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
