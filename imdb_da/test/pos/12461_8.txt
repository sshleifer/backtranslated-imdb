Don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. You will love it or hate it according to your own taste. But if no other reason sees "Greystoke" to experience the excitement of a great actor addressing your heart as he draws life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor for how perfect he could handle Shakespeare; Rather, he must be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. He never cared about his responsibilities as an actor. His reading of the part of Greystoke's sixth gentleman, his last performance, must be appreciated by everyone who loves the theater.
