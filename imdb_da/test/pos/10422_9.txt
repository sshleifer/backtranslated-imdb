Wow, I've probably seen part of Kelli McCarty this summer. I didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star flower in front of me, just as Michelle Hall did a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality softcore girl I've seen in Kelli McCarty with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. The "wish and deception" was okay, but it was not spectacular. There are spoilers in this review, so read only if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) heading out of the big city and into the mountains. She inherited a house from her beloved descendant grandmother and plans to make it a mountain hut. Before she can even put her stuff down, a woman named Kim (uncredited in this movie, but quite aggressive) begins to order guests to stay there. Now she has to get the house in shape quickly - in Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood woman, comes to rescue. Chip helps her get the house in working order. She hires two local slackers to work in her lodge - Chip's sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sex friend Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are starting to come. The first to come is Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. Linda and Eric come into a big argument during a dinner party halfway through the movie leading to their breakup; Sad things there. Then there is Romanesque novelist Sophia, who is played by B-film goddess Monique Parent. She uses the stupid alias Scarlet Johansing again, and she has a very professional look this time - of course with blond hair. It would not be Monique if she did not have at least one scene where she plays with herself - and she undertakes during one of Eric's and Linda's sex scenes. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane - Yes, the porn star Devinn Lane) also appear for a little weekend break. Unknown to Shene, James and Christina have quite a story. James and Christina used to date, but Christina broke it out to the head of this mountain hut. James comes up to the lodge to get Christina back, but his plan goes back. Christina wastes Shene's prayers, causing Shene to go out to him and down to the local bar to strip the locals. Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single Eric, and they go together. Bait realizes that she wants more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next Romanesque novel. <br /> <br /> In fact .... if you ask me, this whole movie was like a Romanesque novel. I don't know if the manuscript went in that direction, but I probably got the impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in this movie and played the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. She seems to enjoy all the fighting and her back continues. <br /> <br /> Now for the sexy. There was quite a lot of it and it was the usual bump and grind stuff. Monique made her fair share of groaning in her two sex scenes. This movie was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience a little interested in sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was simply Monique. Out of all the softcore actresses I've seen over the years, she's best to act in my opinion. She can really act and be sexy, why She sticks to the # 1 position in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better at making softcore movies than she is at the soap opera "Passions", I don't know why she doesn't do more of these. mostly in a limited role, Samantha McConnell continues to impress me and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress over to softcore realm and does a half decent job on it. <br /> <br /> Sex: B ( It was good but not surprisingly spectacular. Lots of moaning. Don't look at the R-rated version, trust me .... most of the good things are taken out. My character is for the unknown version.) B: One great story He throws in a constructed "Ooh, the building inspector must close us" subplot towards the end that destroys thing. The underlying story between Christina and James was beautiful, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and imagery, which you usually found in Romanesque short stories, was a good touch.) General: B + (I found this movie to be quite entertaining. not a surefire Softcore Hall-Of-Famer like "Girl for Girl", but it is a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
