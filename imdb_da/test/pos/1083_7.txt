Once again, I have to play some of the contrarian. Most reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but little. A 7 out of 10 corresponds to a "C" letter rating from me. It seems that much praise is rooted in two factors: One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood movie and two that it tries to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I could not care less about. I'm not looking for realism in movies, and then I don't score higher for a movie showing a story and characters closer to how I believe in the real world to be - I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, though I don't like realistic movies just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree that it is legitimate to try to do things differently. However, I do not believe that "originality" versus formalism creates a better or worse movie in itself. A movie can be "original" and bad, just like a movie can be formal and excellent. What matters is how well the film does what it does, and how comfortable or aesthetically pleasing it is to the viewer. Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai politician called Daya Naik. Naik was a "meeting specialist". Meetings specialists who could be said to be early instantiations by the real world "Judge Dredds", are trained to operate as the criminal and gang members they pursue, and they are basically given a permit to kill - effectively acting as a policeman, judge, jury and fines for a moment. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the meeting specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interact with his colleagues, meet with specialists and engage in violence. We see him at home and try to live a normal life in his less than luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adapt to a new "commissioner" halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with an infamous Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). All of this has the potential to make a fabulous, laughing movie. I agree that it is nice to refrain from the typical Bollywood music and romances - not all movies need it; Ab Thank you Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romance in the background or by the road in many films that he is instructed or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances - Patekar gives almost a Death Wish (1974) -era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable filmography - the handheld stuff near the beginning of the movie was particularly effective. It has a fantastic score that blends more of a humorous Hollywood-sounding action / crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. Violence is well done and greedy. There is also decent exploration of subtitles, including the morals of (having) meeting specialists, the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. The meeting leaders are shown that they have to differ widely from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly, the film asks the profit for blindly following orders. In parallel, the meeting draws specialists on orders and say members of a country's military, and we are shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to. But (you just knew there was a "But," Not? "Director Shimit Amin and his screenwriters have made a story with too many characters, too much spread, and it goes a bit too slowly. All these issues are due to that Amin and the crew look at the godfather movies, which Ab Tak Chappan has (at least superficial) resemblance to, although it is the policeman's perspective. <br /> <br /> Most of the meeting specialists we do not learn very well - These are low-drawn characters for the least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the movie, his name mentioned a number of times, but I would just get a glimpse of him until the scene would change, then everyone will change clothes from the time they appear again, and I'll start to figure out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same thing happened to Agesse's first commissioner, the film was already well into the new Commissioner before I could find out the relationships. It looks like there are new characters in each scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. Although it may have some artistic advantages that the meeting rooms mostly kill people, they do not know anything (because they mostly do it on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the meeting specialists, it is either difficult to Find signs to care about, and it doesn't exactly make a gripping movie. <br /> <br /> The primary villain is Zameer. But until halfway through the movie there is no indication of this. He does not get much more screen time than the other villains who parade through the movie, and he literally "calls his performance in" - he is in another place (Dubai) who only communicates by telephone to the majority of the film. In fact, we do not see Zameer doing much. To some extent, the film depends on a few "twists" that do not necessarily indicate that Zameer does a number of things, but we could see him doing other things, and many other villains could have been omitted. <br /> <br /> It would have boosted the film a little, making it more focused and half an hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action movie in any way. At least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's great style, but said, "Okay, continue the story".
