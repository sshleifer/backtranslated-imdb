One of my favorite movies when it is on, even though I once admit missing it when it was at Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> Despite the age of the movie, it does not look like that story, even though it had been made a thousand times before it was still entertaining. There was one or two little niggles for me in the story, but I looked past them and just enjoyed the movie for what it was. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give it a 7/10
