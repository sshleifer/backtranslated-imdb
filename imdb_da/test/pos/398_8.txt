<br /> <br /> `` The Last Frontier '' is a superior Western who overcomes many deficiencies by weaving his story of stairs Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationship to the army, especially Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adapt to live the "civilized" life within a fort on the edge of the last border. Jed, who has been raised by Gus, inspires both and looks up to the "older" Gus and Mungo, and has a particularly difficult time dealing with "civilization". His real problems begin after he is greatly attracted to the Colonel's wife, Corrina. Colonel Marstonis a ruthless man who hurts anyone about him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman oppressed by her station and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Captured in the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and sympathetic man torn among his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fears of the likely catastrophic consequences of the Colonel's ruthlessness. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that the weaknesses and strength of "The Last Frontier" are the same elements (forget the innocent title and dated music) <br /> < br /> First, the manuscript. Almost all sub-plates (especially the innocent colonel) have been made better elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. Exactly when you think you know what will happen next time, it starts in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Last Frontier" is a "Production Code" movie (back on the day the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the adulteration factor was handled in such a mature, tolerant manner. I expected either Jed or Colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. I was surprised and somewhat disappointed that the film did not take the expectation to create a less predictable ending. <br/> <br /> Other, casting. Older people are at least ten years old to play the part of Jed, the innocent innocent raised in the forest. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "the man who traveled Jed" is actually five years younger than the Elder. Nevertheless, the maturity is very brave, plays a character that is innocent of civilization, but is by no means stupid. Although there were several players who could have played the role at that time (especially Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could have played Jed better. Preston (also mother's junior) plays Colonel Marston, lacking the tics and affections one would expect from such a driven man. Thus, Preston captures the honor that a person must have seen in Marston to promote such a ruthless fool to the rank of the colonel. Bancroft is a particularly wise choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair is dead blonde, and it has the same effect as Winona Ryder (`Edward Scissorhands') and Christina Ricci ('Sleepy Hollow'). That is, I felt in conflict with the character without knowing exactly why; I think the answer is that blondes and brunettes have significantly different skin tones and eye colors. Furthermore, Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here blonde hair softens her a bit). This allows the 24-year-old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40-year-old mature and the 37-year-old Preston; Yes, she could be a Colonel's wife. Madison takes a meticulously balanced action like Riordan, handles a complex role and sometimes acward dialogue. Plays a role similar to John Waynes 'Fort Apache' Madison does a better job on it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a `Silverado 'type of camaraderie. It alone makes it worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, beautiful scenic and good actions and directions. I just hope that a letterbox version is available (many are lost) because this movie takes full advantage of this format.
