How many movies can you think of when watching a movie like this? I can't count them, but it was safe as the filmmakers tried to give me a tip. I was often reminded of other movies, it was a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. A line in itself is not that bad, but this movie lends so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk. BUT ... Watch the movie! In spite of its fallout, there is enough to make it interesting and perhaps make it look wise. While borrowing so much from other films, it never goes overboard. In fact, you will probably find yourself beating down the shutters and tearing out the storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher, and I almost gave him on the Guardian, but he did well. Costner wears the film swimming with the best of Costner's ability. I don't think Mrs Robinson had anything to do with his success. <br /> <br /> The support noise around played their parts well. I had no problem with any of them in the end. But some of these signs were used too much. <br /> <br /> From here I can only nit-pick, so I will save you wear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work well enough to keep your head over water. Just don't expect a sliding ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 but almost a 6.
