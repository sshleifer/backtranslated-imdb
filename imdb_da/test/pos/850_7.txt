I can remember this movie from watching it in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS & it stopped my memory of it. Although of course it is not a "big budget" movie, the play is pretty credible, and the landscape, sites and costumes are very well done. I only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture, but when you see them, they are also well done (remember that SFX was done these days without the benefit of computers, some poor devils had to actually put all that hair and false tusks on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on the elephants in "Quest for Fire". A better than average adventure movie and a chance for the star, Rod Cameron to play something beyond a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.
