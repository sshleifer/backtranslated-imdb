This little movie brings many memories back, both sad and what can and happens when you are a work musician. The not so comfortable accommodation for the band, the management of the venue jumps up and down telling you what to play, the glorious ecstasy of the applause ............. Far from being farcical is It really is very accurate in the way it portrays musicians, professionals and otherwise who have traveled a great distance to perform a season of concerts in one place. There are times when everything goes perfectly, there are the other times when you immediately miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing so far from home. In the end, make the best of it, because there is no other way out.
