This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While it is not in the same class as some of the better-known films of its time, it is still extremely visible and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott sits on a bus steals the airman's pin from a cloak about the seat next to him, by chance is amazing. It defines his character beautifully - a guy who is so low, he will devise something of invaluable value for a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades. He lies easily as the situation demands and captures the women in Fenchurch household with its irresistible charm and the killing smile. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wonder if this movie was made to exploit the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett were reunited and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford, with his facial bone structure and large eyes. In addition, the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the evil Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment that the end of the movie was too pat, with the practical thumb over a rock to "Ronnie Mason", Zachary Scott's character. Also in one of the final scenes we see bratty Mona Freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously despised in favor of the older, smoother Zachary Scott. I think the manuscript should have encouraged her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty to her sister, rather than treating it as just a typical youth episode. But it is less lacking in an otherwise fun and well-functioning film.
