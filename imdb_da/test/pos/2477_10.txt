Well, I enjoy this movie, although it sometimes gets too much into a stereotypical situation. I didn't understand at this time whether "Punishment Park" has existed before, but I think the case is not really here. <br /> <br /> You have to look at this movie in a different way. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world led by violence and that no one can escape from it. If anyone refuses to "take his responsibility" then you will be thrown out of our society ... All our history is made of wars, we should never forget this. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that we might change and understand that our "intellectual skills" have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In 2 words, this movie is a must see, maybe it will help us accept the truth ...
