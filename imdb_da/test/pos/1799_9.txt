"Valley Girl" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80 version of "Romeo and Juliet." It is a concrete example of an 80-year-old teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portraits in this movie, but it will never come to the top "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate 80's teen girl because if it wasn't for the "Fast Times" then 80 The girls of teenage flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That is for sure.
