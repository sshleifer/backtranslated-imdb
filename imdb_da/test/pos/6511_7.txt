If you like stupid comedies like Airplane, you'll love this movie! It's certainly in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A fun movie! It has the strangest cast of everyone in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, but I think they should be, as it is a silly comedy. There are apparently two versions of the movie, one at Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website seems to be a preview release version signed by the director. There is fun behind the scenes material filmed on Neverland with Michael Jackson too. The film was filmed in 2003 and says it is PG-rated fun on the box.
