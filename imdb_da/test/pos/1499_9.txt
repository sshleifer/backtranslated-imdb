Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full features. And I assume that most people have seen only a few clips from him from his pre-function days, as he starred for dozens of dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone sees this movie, they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and tied them up with a little tale to make this 1959 feature film. This is good for several reasons. First in Chaplin's earliest film from 1914 to 1915, his character of Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is completely absent. Plus, even when he is there, he was often medieval and self-centered - something very foreign to Little Tramp, we have grown to love. Secondly, because the selected shorts were in good condition, if you watch this movie, you don't have to worry about seeing scraped-down gaps and miserable musical accompaniments that don't fit the action (a common problem). /> <br /> So for a good look at Chaplin's shorts at their best, give this movie a try. It's safe to give you some good laughs.
