Another "End of the World" movie asking for comparison with the immense "Day After Tomorrow". By the same structure as DAT, but with a distinct Japanese style. How are you? It depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I found out that the small human touches are what make this movie compelling for most of it is 2+ hours. Also, the frequent title cards explain some of the science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese movie, and they compare very well with something out of Hollywood. Many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying, although the human carnage is usually extinguished. And that is one of the drawbacks. While the terror of thousands of on-screen deaths, as in the recent World War, may be too overwhelming, we also do not get a sense of chaos from a whole nation crumbling in the ocean. A few scenes touch the chaos, but mostly this part of the story is hardly touched. Either way, this movie works on many levels and is far more realistic than DAT, it's until the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story hangs on a clich√©-plot unit and another plot unit that would be at home in the 1960's Japanese land of danger movie "Gorath". After the reasonably good science and most realistically addressing the disaster, it gives little disappointment The abrupt halt of the movie to a pop love song does not help (unless you like the song). It made the "exciting" end up with a little move for me. the direction is good and the art design is excellent. It is also good. Recommended.
