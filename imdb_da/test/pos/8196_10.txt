After watching the movie a couple of times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, Assassin has become one of the favorite movie characters all the time. This fine Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy with words and movements saw any American actor today. The emperor, Qin, is brilliant as he directs the audience to believe in the kindness of his heart to release only the most cruel acts on the people around him. The promises he makes with incredible passion and smashed with an evil fist. Gong Li, who in almost every movie I've ever seen her in, is simply amazing. Her screen dominance is so graceful and emotional. <br /> <br /> If you couldn't tell, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
