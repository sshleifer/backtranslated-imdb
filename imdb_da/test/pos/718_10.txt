Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Teachers of Children" is a wonderful, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camera work and cinema combined with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast increases the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction by her married boarding-school advisory adviser. The scenes between the incredibly scary actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually pronounced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most exciting and powerful I've ever seen on movies. The lesson eventually learned here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a dull man who creates bad art." Well, I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of "art" to anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema.
