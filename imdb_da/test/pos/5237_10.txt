If you overlook the technical issues of this early (1930) audio movie as sound quality and occasional stiffness at John Wayne, you will find this movie an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since. Beginning in Missouri, a large caravan Conestoga carts, people and animal head west. The wagons are pulled down large cliffs and cross a flooded river with great risk for the riders in the carts. Indians meet with wayne and allow the train to pass through their land. Later, Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The carriages form a large circle with horses and cattle in the circle and ferret their rifles that create smoke with the circling Indians. <br /> <br /> When the fight ends, the dead are buried on the spot and people and wagons depart. This scene is remarkable as the camera remains with the dead as the living departures. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. The wagons encounter a large thunderstorm with heavy downfalls and mud everywhere. They finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in Oregon. The film is made in 70 mm widescreen with a ratio of 2.0: 1 (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I haven't mentioned the plot because it's secondary to the scenic grandeur and the vast amount of work involved in making this movie. Moviemakers will never work hard again to make such a movie or movie. Given the technical limitations of the sound, the music moves at times, such as when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt for her friend's kills and at the end. While all the critics rage about The Searchers and Waynes psychology, racism, short temper and complex characters, The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people experiencing extraordinary hardships. One of the best westerns I've seen.
