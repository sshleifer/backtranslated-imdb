The connection with James Dean? In a short plane we see Emilio Estevez toying with a teddy bear (remember the first scene of Ray's "rebellion for no reason"). In addition, the main conflict is Estevez versus Sheen, father to son, as in "East of Eden". The soldier has come home, and no one has been able to communicate with him, even his sister (a psychology student, what is there). The mother, a raw matron (an amazing Kathy Bates), stuck in the nougatine, she cannot understand that her values ​​(religion, family) have become a past, especially for one as her son whose innocence was betrayed. The father, an effortless man during his wife's thumb, although trying hard to play macho, wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life. So he saved his "glory" by forcing his son to perform his duty. where Estevez's hatred for his father explodes is very intense. The actor's instructor gives a reluctant performance, interiors that Lee Strasberg's students used to do, and his last outburst of anger has increased tenfold.
