The whole movie made me think of the first circle of Dante's Inferno, where the souls who "fool" themselves into believing they are happy go to it. They are never aware that they are actually in an inferno, but nothing is fun, they just move on without emotion. In that sense, Dante believed they were in the worse part, as they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die in that place, but certainly tries to hurt. I'm not sure if the author based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the similarity is quite striking. <br /> <br /> I didn't enjoy the movie as I watched it as I had expected a climax that never came. Nonetheless, it made me think afterwards, and now I actually think it's a good movie - it sure holds.
