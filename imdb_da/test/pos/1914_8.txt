Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore who pimp superhero to wrong rights while challenging MAN along the way. He has two enemies, it's not good Willie Green and the shabby mayor. Watch the Dolemite kick, punch, flap and pimp his way across the screen. What is the name of the man? DOLEMITE! <br /> <br /> Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and artists. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made more on the cheap movies during the seventies. Even produced and marketed, he took into account a particular audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others call it garbage, I call it entertaining. Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and one directly for video Return of Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Recommended, a particular cult classic! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the movie was properly matted on video, you would not see boom mikes. Dolemite was cut to receive an R rating.
