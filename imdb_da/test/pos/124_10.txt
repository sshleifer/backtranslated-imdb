This was a great movie in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of deviations from the norm. It criticizes many Indian customs, which many find oppressive - such as arranging marriages of others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, valuation of women with regard to their baby capacity, binding terms of duty, and so on. . At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations in society as the two main characters are in. The film is well-acted and genuine, completely credible from the beginning to the end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main flaws in the movie, as I saw it, were first that the two lovers seem to be drawn to each other not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in final marriages without passion and no rewards . This may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not "become gay". It seems clear from the start of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual - when Radha makes her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that "without a desire she was dead" and the implication was that if he had wanted it, he could have fulfilled her completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband did not seem to like her. Such situations do not make people homosexuals - they can seek comfort from others in the same position, but in the film it is not at all clear that they are lesbians from the beginning - on the contrary. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either heterosexual or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands. . . If that were not the case, would they have, of course, found it necessary to express their desire in a relationship they would not otherwise have considered? The film ignores this. The second error is the naming of the characters. . . the names Sita and Radha seem intentionally designed to shock and upset (imagine a movie in America depicting a homosexual relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another named "Paul"!) by using names that are associated with various Hindu scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and need no such devices in my opinion. In any case, the errors do not take far away from the power of the film. In fact, it's a very moving and strong story - the pictures and characters will stay with you long after you leave the theater.
