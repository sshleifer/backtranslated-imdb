After five years of imprisonment, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dear friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel), and they invite Tony to steal a few jewels from the showcase of the famous jewelry Mappin & Web Ltd. but he rejects. Tony finds his former boyfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the nightclub L 'Âge d' or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her and strikes her back and takes her jewels. Then he calls Jo and Mario and suggests a burglary of the jewelery safe. They invite the Italian specialist in safes and the elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to participate in their team and they discover a perfect hoist. They succeed in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress. "You Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a magnificent film noir, certainly among the best I've seen. The play has credibility, backed by a fantastic direction by Jules Dassin, amazing performances of cast and great filmography. Jean Servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles governed by the underworld rules. The famous long silent sequence of the hoist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best in cinema history. I note this amazing movie in my favorite movie list ever. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ribbed"
