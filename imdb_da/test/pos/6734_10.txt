This movie starts with all the humorous promise of a great modern noir Western - after the unimaginable opening flashback sequence anyway. The landscape is beautifully deserted, the signs are painfully isolated. While some of the actors are less than credible, the plot ultimately gives enough tension and twists to making this movie appreciated.
