I felt sorry enough that this movie is not popular at all even in Hong Kong. But for every die hard Chows fan this will be a masterpiece that doesn't throw b out. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on unrealistic and ridiculous plot pioneered by Chow) at its highest point. The reason is ultimately 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is fantastic. No single part of the movie is cooled down so you have to stop laughing. The plot looks simple but brittle so you can start laughing. It begins with Chow with a junior judge (a devastated one of course) trapped in jail when he helps an innocent married woman he loves at first sight to clear her from a murder charge, as plotted by the evil minister whose son actually was the real convicted. Chow escaping from prison and running away as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and report the conviction. Along the way, he manages to collect 2 lovely women, one from the circus, another a prostitute, while in the meantime mastering the highest skill to bestow and bad mouth from the thin Mama-san (who happens to be his future in the law). Finally, he could force the emperor to reopen the case by black mail to the emperor, as he meets him in the brothel. The emperor made him the highest judge to judge the case with the evil minister. He manages to set up some brilliant but fun plots to force the prison to commit the crime, execute him while throwing the evil minister into prison. The plots are really fun and ridiculously brilliant. Also, not to forget the enormous dialogue that includes some brilliant bad mouths between Chow and Mama-san, quarrel between the fat Mama-san and thin Mama-san to inspire Chow to learn the disgrace later and also to dispute Chow and evil eunuch Lee near the end. In addition, some of the scenes are also brilliant. One thing to mention is that you really understand the movie and get 100% of all the elements correctly, it will be a must to master Cantonese really well. Which may be the reason why Chow films from early age only receive moderate answers from the Asian world. But when Chow movies began spreading their influence around the globe, hardcore fans like me found that his movie is not as fun as the old time.
