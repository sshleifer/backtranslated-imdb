This movie really used its locations well with some amazing pictures, dark and disturbing movie moving very slowly but keeping you constantly alert. Modern Love has worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year, giving the audience a glimpse of an Australian cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly, it is refreshing to see the Australian cinema not take on the clich√©s Aussie characters and stories we have seen through the years. This film will compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well-developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
