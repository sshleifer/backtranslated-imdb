This film is about a teenager who is struggling with his social status in school. He is a "good Christian" and feels that he misses all the fun in high school. So he wants him to never become one. After getting his wish and trying a world culture, he discovers that his quality of life has been dramatically reduced and wants to go back to being the person he was. Good family oriented movie with a positive message to be proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
