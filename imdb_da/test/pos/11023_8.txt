Wow! I caught this at the IFC recently after I looked at Im Im Cheerleader. Id never heard of this movie, but the description sounded externally interesting. I went in with low expectations, and now I have to say that this is one of the best love stories ever in movies. Robin Tunney does an excellent job showing a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and only the smallest details in the film is so accurate and credible. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this movie really affected me. So I recommend this movie to anyone with the ability to watch.
