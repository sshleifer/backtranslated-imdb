It's the old old story: kids have a party in an old house, demons are resolved, death and free nudity ensues. You know it all, it's still very fun. Many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have good memories of this movie and it is always with easy inflammation that you return to an old movie to see if it still is as good as you used to believe it was. Luckily, this is here. <br /> <br /> It has something for everyone (well, everyone who happens to be male, I assume). From a fun title order to a shoplifting scam that involves the clever use of Linnea Quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene fully on demonic fun, this is a blast from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The girls are cute, guys are. . . . Male death scenes are well done with some good gore effects, and unlike some horrors from the era, this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even excitement through. Don't make me wrong, it's still fun first and foremost, but it does provide some fun, freaky moments that should delight most genre fans.
