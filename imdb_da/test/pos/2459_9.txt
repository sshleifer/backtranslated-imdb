<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful game HOMEFRONT and makes it an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The war at home has an unusually strong casting - everyone seems to dig deep into their characters. The action here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> Credit should also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were very smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the excitement. Remove all Viet Nam elements from the story and still would be interesting characters that break down with the good and bad of the whole spectrum of family dynamics. (A viewer can see this point more clearly by remembering "discover the old photo" scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is seen). As a movie I found THE WAR In the home to be more direct and to the point than born on July 4th. A nice bet - almost a 10. <br /> <br />
