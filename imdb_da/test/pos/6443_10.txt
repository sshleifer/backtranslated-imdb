An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a few shady chimney sweeps, is mistakenly accused of stealing from the mansion where he works at Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and continues running. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners (Samantha Gates, a slender blue-eyed blonde, with long wavy hair, which I certainly was the primary reason why I repeatedly saw this as a boy). He and his dog jump into a river, and a witch makes them water-breathing cartoon characters! While under water, he liberates and saves a group of water-breathing children known as water children from a shark. A very interesting and always fascinating template set in 1850 should appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of the 85 minute HBO VHS print) is just average, but it is preferable to most modern animation - even computer animation! My only real grip is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. Kl. 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum", the film cuts to a scene of octopi swimming, followed by Tom and Jacques meeting with Terence. This leads to a scene where the killer shark (pronounced by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom, "Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time in HBO's print that Tom meets the shark! Most reference books indicate running time as 92 or 93 minutes, and was previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is highly likely that HBO's print is edited and / or time-compressed. MGM released insult to injuries, released a full screen, 76 minute DVD printing in 2002! Let us hope that a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyright Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the water baby pronounced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in crime, also speaks the electric eel. A.k.a. Slip Slide Adventures.
