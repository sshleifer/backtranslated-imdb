Who are the people in this thing? Never heard of them !! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've run over. It should win the Putz Puller prize for parody. The absurd begins with Dr. Jeykl to grab his powder and become a sex enemy. He is pursued by the libido-driven nurse early in the film in one of the funniest scenes in the film. Pay attention to the hospital's PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde, who accepts the prize, has made me laugh for years. Oh ... and "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who continued to become Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. <br /> <br /> If you liked Mel Brook's classic movie (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suppose you would like this one. <br /> <br /> Damn shame, you can't get it on DVD anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's available on DVD now !!!!! Good things DVDs do not wear from use !!!!!
