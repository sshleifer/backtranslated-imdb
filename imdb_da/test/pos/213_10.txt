Two years after the success of "Airplane", Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen as a clean-dressed detective "Frank Drebin". Also in the cast were Alan North as 'Captain Ed Hocken', Ed Williams as 'Ted Olsen' and William Duell as 'Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy'. 'Police Team!' featured spooky corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame where the characters in the frame stand completely still. One of the best "freezer frames" sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still and causing the cup to overflow! Guest stars were killed in the opening titles, one included Georg Stanford Brown who was crushed by a falling surely! Despite getting positive reviews and very critical recognition, 'Squad!' lasted only six episodes before they were canceled. This did not mean the end, however, five years later, the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'Naked Gun' films.
