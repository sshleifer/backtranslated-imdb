The only reason I decided to watch this movie is because of Karen Silla, Alyson Haywood's great play, "Bad Money", "99 deeply involved in Gary Cole," Dave "," Cry Wolf "'05, who is a great war hero and has all sorts of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes difficult and Alyson decides to find out of what happens and the plot becomes very mysterious If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this is the movie for you, I only wish Karen would show up in more movies, I miss her amazing talents.
