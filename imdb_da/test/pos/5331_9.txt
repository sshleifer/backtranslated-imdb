Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for the murder of an autistic child. When you press the question 'Why?' he has no answer. While in jail, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps Leland find out why he did. Throughout this film, we learn all about Leland's troubled life, including his ex-boyfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and his whole sad life. <br /> <br /> This movie is Matthew Ryan Hogen's second movie and it is spectacular in almost everyway. This is a movie that will let you think in the end and wonder how it all works. The movie is pretty dark, but if you can handle it then you will realize how good a movie it is. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is no bad guy. There is no one to blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes, and the audience is not trying to prove Leland guilty. Instead, we sit back, relax and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the film's cross. All the problems depicted in history are very real. Drug abuse, parents' expectations, overwhelming sadness; They all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is one of the greatest shows in his career in this movie, as the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and does not care much about his son. The only one he loves is Becky, but she has her own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie, "You want a why, but maybe there isn't one. Maybe it's something that just happened." There is a why, but we don't find out When you see the movie, the audience is amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world, Leland notes things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> A particularly thought-provoking scene that really hit me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl, Pearl just cheated his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is only human, so Leland says something that never really happens to somebody: "Why do people just say it when they have done something wrong?" Another great play was delivered by Chris Klein, and in the movie he plays Allen Harris, the girlfriend of Becky's sister Julie (Michelle Williams). by the protagonists, I was surprised at how deep his character was an relate to Allen a lot. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It's as if they were his own flesh and blood. At the end of the movie you realize just how far he would go to help them. <br /> Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by a few people. However, if you take the time to see it, you will most likely see that everything I have mentioned above is true. And when you're done watching it, you'll never see the world the same way again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
