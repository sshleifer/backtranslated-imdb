I love a movie that mixes excitement in the excitement, laughs, style, good acting and some self-pity. Hitchcock carried it out constantly, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville did the same. I was sorry when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator who found comments from one of my countrymen's chauvinists. I love French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies - and the ever-softer American movies. I also feel the author who has filmed the film to be not even a good copy of an American gangster movie, missing the point altogether. But I think it's like jazz: You get it too, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain. Just watch "Le Cercle noir" and be prepared to be entertained.
