This interesting film noir has three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are extremely excellent. Demming, as a detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks intelligence, strength and cynical worldview of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic. <br /> <br /> Tempo, location (a library) and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization he represents. Nevertheless, Sanders seems to have experienced no anxiety or remorse when he mistakenly kills Blackmer. Sanders then grabs the library and its residents using the ruse that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. However, Sanders' hit man later tries to kill Demming by shooting him (without silencer), although the many other detainees might have been expected to hear and be alarmed by noise. Finally, Sander's hit man tries to kill Roberts, who has discovered the truth, but when she falls, he makes it inexplicably. However, what disturbed me most was that the chance of a large and unexpected conclusion was wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as a smart, hard-as-nails sociopath who fears nothing. But in the end she flies the panic trap from the last surviving Nazi, a brutal gang. At the time the police find him, he has killed her. And she ends up being just another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have been is this: the police find the Nazi chew but he is dead. She has skillfully killed him and then disappeared - to continue her evil ways.
