I just wanted to inform anyone who might be interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite of all time. I admire the work Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This movie made a good impression on me because of its reality and its appreciation of details in life in New Jersey. It hit a chord with me personally because I grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. It also made an impression on me because I used to spend time at Teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept "right". At times, this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know if these were real events that took place. Although films like "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" receive more attention, I personally feel that these movies were something "enhanced" to appeal to a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising piece of "in your face" reality. Lee and Gomez covered all the details of this urban drama of music, clothing, snake and location. Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they were not "actors". Nothing was compromised to do good "theater". The only accident coming from this movie was that many people "slept" on it. I look forward to several works by Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future.
