In the ever-growing film genre with cartoon adaptations, Blade is by far the most realized and most faithful (parent) to the source material .... since the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's tomb of Dracula, the author took Almost all the characters and plot elements from the comic story. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the movie steam roll went over any criticism. Don't let any of your friends tell you otherwise: Blade is a nice movie. If it feels like "comic booky" to you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because it was supposed to. Deal with it, but don't do it for it.
