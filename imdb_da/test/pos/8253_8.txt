Lovely! It never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it is a mini-gem of British comedy in the late seventies. When the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it comes from an American (the late character actor Richard Jordan), but at least he is not the usual boring Hollywood hunk type. Around him is the cream of British acting talent, led by a wonderful game and superior David Niven. <br /> <br /> Of course, Niven's Ivan the Terrible gets the best lines and all the best shots. He also manages to be surprisingly threatening and frighteningly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club, when he drops the charming facade and threatens, Richard Jordan will come as a shock to the viewers who think of Niven as being only a light comic comedy star. He is full of real power and recklessness, as we all immediately see how Ivan got his nickname. The more surprising it was, how sick Niven was at that time. Shortly after filming this production, he lost the voice of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last picture Niven made, where you can hear his own voice, which is subsequently called by the comic impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> With him you can see many familiar faces from the 70s cinema and television. Elke Sommer (flashing her breasts in the true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo state), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs when he stops with a security guard who has taken a phone call. "Who are you calling ?! .... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless git!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of London's street locations; makes the film a period of patina time capsule of red telephone boxes with chunky round manual handsets, black cabs driven by "Cor blimey, gov!" Cockneys and ladies and gentlemen who model all kinds of deeply risky late-seventies retro casual wear and hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Unlike the classic Ealing comedies of a previous era, "totally" is allowed to get away with its crime and escape to a life in the sun. How times were changed! The moral code by which villains in films were always to be punished was long gone in the 70s, with anti-armies like Pinky Green's earnings status through their naughty anti-authoritarianism and the will to "sneak a snook" on a foggy capitalist establishment be-suited fat cat businessmen. We are encouraged to rejoice when Pinky turns off, unpunished and free as a bird with its bad winnings. Compare it to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, quaintly dated in its fashion and attitudes, and things in the Sennat cult display. Perfect to see at midnight after the pubs are closed if you are of a certain age, feel a nostalgic feeling, and have always wanted to see David Niven in a branch of McDonald's who silently scares an American using a retractable telescope!
