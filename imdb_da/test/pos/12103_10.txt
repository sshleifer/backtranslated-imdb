Like many other commentators here I went in and expected a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and got more than I asked for. I heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes joking, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the right way) and amazing mix of music and musicians. Reminded me of many forms of Indian music (East Indian), but at the same time it was very much different. From the first track of Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (what a voice) to Siyasiyabend to jam sessions (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call it in India) in the small Turkish bar ft. Selim Seslar (Big fan now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wished it would not end. /> <br /> One of the best music comments I've seen and heard for a long time. <br /> <br /> I need a CD of the soundtrack and hope I can find it online somewhere soon and also for the latest and latest albums from Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still etched in my brain and I don't want it to go away. Turkey and especially Istanbul now seem to be such beautiful and exciting places - and I have to start saving today to take it in. <br /> <br /> Believe Akin - this is a gem.
