The surface was one of the few truly unique shows on television last season. I can honestly say that I changed my schedule so that I could be at home to see each episode. Tons of action, excitement, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched in a sea animal. The same sea creature that had killed the protagonist's brother and the woman's character (oceanographer) had seen. Most people think it is a deadly killer, but the one who left the egg was very kind. <br /> <br /> Only problem is NBC canceled it now we will never know what is happening ... Hopefully Sci-Fi or another channel will pick it up.
