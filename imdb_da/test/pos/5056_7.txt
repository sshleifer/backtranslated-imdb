Very typical Almod√≥var of the time and in his own way no less fun than many of his later works. And why? There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and I think such an effect is more random than intended. No, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into nature: the signs are almost completely lacking in taboo. It is the same kind of "comic tension" you find in his later works, even if you find it in a more rough version here. He builds up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there. <br /> <br /> The only reviewer who commented on this movie before I did claimed that it should be a "very select" group of people like 'I find this movie hilarious. I do.
