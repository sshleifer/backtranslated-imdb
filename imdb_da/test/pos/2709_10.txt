I first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was at Lifetime. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. Sure, it can't have run any longer, but it's as accurate as it may be in my opinion (no matter what anyone else might think). Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. Louise Fletcher (Yes, who played Nurse Ratched in 1975's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") was also fine, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) to be a little freak. I'm a huge fan of the carpenters, and I think Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It really makes me feel like she's gone and left this land prematurely, but thanks to the never-ending popularity of her music and her English voice, the music will continue. In any case, back on track for this movie, it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people (fans and non-fans of the carpenters) about what caused Karen to end this problem with her health. Was it the medium that was responsible, or was it just Karen's decision? I didn't think it was her decision. It could have been the media from an article printed about her somewhere in 70 when their hit "Close to You" came out (from what was shown in the movie). There are also other moments in the movie. Richard's fight with drugs and Karen's short marriage. I did not hear about her loss in February 1983 when I was not yet seeing the news; I had found out years later. I do not know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or Karen made in the future, but until then this movie will do just fine. However, I would say this: If Karen had ignored the false details of the article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her "chubby" (which must have been an insult), she would still be here on this earth today. I know she is in heaven and probably entertain everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
