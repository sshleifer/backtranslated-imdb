The end of Suburbia, which it should appeal to both citizens and consumers, is likely to be cultural reform. The film utilizes superchannic analysis of authors, political decision makers and social philosophers on the paradox created by Suburban Style living - primarily in the post-war era. <br /> <br /> What we've created in America is a place of "none of the country's comforts and none of the city's life-style amenities." This is the recipe that is laid out for suburbia, and film focus is on the unique idea of ​​"Oil". Basically, in the most general sense, the world is approaching or at the highest oil production, and when we fully realize this, greater lifestyle changes will be in effect, either by our best interest or forced violently by a quality of Self if Calcutta's slum dwellers could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing more, the end of Suburbia will seep the viewer flush into their intestines, creating a debilitating sensation. This is bound to happen. It is a gloomy perspective on our inherent lifestyle. Ambivalence is particularly evident in each viewer's critical analysis of the film. I expect many unprepared viewers who fall into the film as sly liberal propaganda - like a Michale Moore movie. What they do not consider is that a reaction like this is too normal when such a message strikes so incredibly hard for the vast majority of masses' lifestyles. <br /> <br /> This is the truth and as a student studying urban planning, I can tell you that we are better prepared now because the slim chance we have of maintaining the quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of manipulated resources, fall faster than a race of people hit by the black plague.
