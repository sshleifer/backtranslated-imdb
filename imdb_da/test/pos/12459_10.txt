The biggest Tarzan ever made! This movie is made in a way no other Tarzan has ever come close to. It has everything in it that you want in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan movie ever has or will never portray the character as well. I would say that if you have seen a Tarzan movie and liked it, you should see this you will love it and if you have never seen Tarzan, you should watch this and forget about the rest of them.
