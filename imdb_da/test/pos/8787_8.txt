You can't do without wondering Hitchcock's early work. For example, "Saboteur" is so smooth and fast that it's hard to believe he made this movie over 60 years ago. There are some propaganda elements, but they are woven into the mystery so well that the case plays beautifully years later. You also get some examples of things that Hitchcock would do later - like using a national landmark as a background. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. Of course, in "North by the Northwest" there is Mt. Rushmore. You also recognize things that appear later in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but let's not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent, as is the oh so charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini-western in this one. It happens quickly, so don't blink.
