I downloaded a DVD of 1 ?? discount, have no idea what it's all about (but at that price I can't resist ..) In short: I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> So much so that I did some research. On the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), episodes were recombined in two 85 minute parts and out of order. Here are my results, based on Wikipedia's episode list: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is in my boots + voice (last episode). <br /> <br /> "War of the Machines" is Hell & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. Underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men. I never saw Charlie's Angels so much so I can't compare but the more I saw, the less I looked at the bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also have fun with this. All in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure was it: ^)
