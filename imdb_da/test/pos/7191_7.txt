In the original French version, the fun of Numérobis (great fun voice - Jamel Debbrouze) is very fun. <br /> <br /> However, in translated versions (I saw the German and English versions) it is not half the original. <br /> <br /> But: goof Special Effects, almost the full cartoon (with differences as the figure of Lügnix (German name) is placed in another cartoon. <br /> <br /> Sure, Asterix The cartoon is cool, but when you look at the animated comics from 1968 to 1998, you will see much better jokes, better story and the old "charm" and "flair" of the cold stories. <br /> <br /> For French speaking people suggest I see it in its original version, with or without subtitles, where they are available in different languages.
