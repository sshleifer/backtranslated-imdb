General Trelayne is a super-creature who wants to play a small game with the company crew. A lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical things seem to happen, and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practice of warfare and murder. He seems to need to experience what he imagines to be excitement and has created a human environment (even though a few hundred years out of date) where he can play his fantasies. The environment is subtly unauthorized, and the crew immediately begins to see the differences. Almost soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is not only an immature god, but a very false one. No matter how you feel about this, you stick to the Twilight Zone-like end. It is worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the more developed and entertaining ongoing character Q - and in John DeLancie's build of this personality one can see more than just nuances of Campbell's Trelayne. It's fun to compare how the four captains we've seen handle Q, so handle him so radically differently.
