Good show, really good play, and the director makes us swim through his story in an interesting unpredictable way, especially since it's mainly two people in one room. It does not run like many modern films, but it does not. Bohl is flippant enough to believe in her in "now" of her character, who is still involved and does not go on her career opportunities - so it is credible without having to show us a deep self-study of her soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, resentment and class to pull out 'Buddy' very well. Slightly grainy on film quality, but it fits the tone of the story. Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things, but definitely worth seeing.
