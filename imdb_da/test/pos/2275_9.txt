I went into the cinema, without expectations of the movie I was witnessing, "everything is enlightened". I went out with a joy, I have hardly come to feel with American movies. Actor actor Leiv Schreiber's debut follows the film a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group with a brake dance barely English-speaking punk from the Eucharine, his grandfather who thinks he's blind and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is fun and clever with an extreme European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, while the other half of the film falls into a gloomy story of discovery and holocaust. This little movie brings so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of lighting, but also of relationships and connections. The action is incredibly powerful, the story is mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography is to die for. With some brilliant and touching scenes, "Everything is enlightened," managed to catch my heart.
