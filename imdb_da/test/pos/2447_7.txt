This movie was well done. It covers the difficulties a recurrent Vietnam veteran has in dealing with the atrocities of war. Unfortunately, the authors chose to focus on a Vet who had been involved in an act of cruelty. I was in Vietnam and only once heard of such an act by someone who experienced it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The notion that only veterinarians involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a poor service to all who served. All the soldiers I knew personally or knew by mouth were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and thought they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was coming home to learn that many Americans were against the war. It has made many veterans feel that they had participated in something less than honest. Not the way they served. The end showed that the father acts more like a belligerent bully than a loving, caring father. For that I gave it a 7 out of 10. Had the end allowed for a degree of acceptance I could have judged it to be a 9. <br /> <br /> Most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional year. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome it. I ask that the public be more understanding of our contemporary veterans than the Vietnam era.
