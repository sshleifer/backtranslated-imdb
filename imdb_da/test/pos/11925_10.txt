Quick summary of the book: Boy, Billy Carpets, about 12 years old, is the school's biggest problem maker, and if he is kicked out of a school, he will be sent to the college. His upscale boys school in Switzerland (or somewhere like that) is being taken over by Arab terrorists, so I am not entirely sure. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to check in his school's database. He helps two teachers fight the terrorist plans and save the whole school. The book was not bad, but was sooooo clich√©. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie; they changed Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists and made Billy around 17 and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get into trouble, but normal teenage things. This movie was credible. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can see Billy, Joey and the rest of the boys and see real kids acting like they did (or at least want to). Big action scenes. Not everything goes as planned on both sides. Overriding the terrorists was messy and good people were hurt. I don't want to say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know I use the word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he usually played the best best friend. This movie again showed that he could play the leading man, child, regardless. The only accomplishment that might have arisen was Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of a New Jersey mafia man. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Usually, this genre of film is one that I see for the purpose of the soul to make fun; but not toy soldiers. History line flows, dialogue is usually credible. I can't think of a single moment when I found myself yelling at the TV "Oh, it wouldn't happen" Great movie that was to be in everyone's collection.
