LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among underwater vehicles like a renegade and maverick (* Note to reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise". Maverick means "deviant".), Is actually an intelligence operative to vice admiral of his submarine fleet. The nephew is concerned about our old friends, the Russians, who have farm sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get the hands of this baby and release a nuclear weapon in Norfolk Harbor or Mayport, Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11. The Admiral assigns Dodge to take command of a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and USS ORLANDO, a top of the line rapid attack sub. Dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears .. err thinks his lovable group of oddball underwater for warriors. Despite being "aboard" tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and just commander, he does not choose favorites, and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. US NAVY could not have gotten a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this beautifully made understated gem from the creator of the "Police Academy".
