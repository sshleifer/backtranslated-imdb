I haven't seen every movie that Burt Reynold's ever made, but this one (which I just finished watching in the third time) may well be his best! It only suffers from some slow stretches; Burt might have tried to make it more "artificial" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the "hard cop" role he plays (see, for example, the scene in which he tries to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time or the fear he is just saying before the final showdown with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and the two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cops from the 80s. The film also has some rude touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fistfight and many orderly shots. (***)
