Some people think this was a pretty bad TV series, with a cheesy effect. (considering it was filmed between 1977-1979), but really looks back in those years and thinks, "We didn't have computers then." So if you think about it, it's a pretty good TV show. <br /> <br /> I've always thought bad reviews killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled their theme as the "superhero network" and left a short-lived spider-man series. If it had gone further, it would probably have gone well into the 80s and if it was really lucky (and I mean really lucky), the early 90s. And no one wanted to pick this series up. Anyway, Jolly Old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, of the sound of music fame, is brought to the television screen as Peter Parker, the secret identity of the amazing spider-man. Peter is dealing with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician in the series. <br /> <br /> while the series is far from the timeline (being that Peter is already educated from the university and that is when he gets a little, and Uncle Ben is already dead). The audience is treated to action, excitement and the attitude of the people towards Peter and his alter ego, spider-man. <br /> <br /> While it's also a little disappointing that Robert. F Simon does not look like JJJameson, it is not so disappointing that Betty grant is not Betty grant, but a warm African-American girl (who reminds me of Halle Berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet) so really a wasn't that bad. <br /> <br /> But given the time and how much drama they packed into this one, it provides some kind of shadow what bad TV is today. It is entertaining, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
