VIP Keys are one of the most entertaining, informative and hilarious shows on television right now. The idea is original and well done, as it manages to maintain the aspect of reality, but still remains entertaining. All judges have a razor. They are not the best at all times, but if you are looking for comfort, look at a chicken. Say what you like about the validity of the show, but it is just right. I know people who have competed on the show and they have confirmed this. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, see this show. It is on the best comedy shows ever made.
