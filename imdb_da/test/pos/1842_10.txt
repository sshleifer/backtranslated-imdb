Awesome movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a big fan of David Duchovny and he's great in this movie! I would love to see him in several movies of this kind. His talents are absolutely under-utilized and have so much more to offer besides "Agent Mulder" (although I'm also a big fan of that series), Anyway, I'd like to see more of him. He is easily Cary Grant from our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you must! Great love story that shows that love never dies ... it's with you forever. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a casting containing Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This movie didn't get any kind of prizes, but deserved one. Great job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
