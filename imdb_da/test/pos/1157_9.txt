Why couldn't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and Algeria stemmed from attacks on French military and civilian settlements. This film could have been sustained by the historical aspect of the French seizing Rasuadli so that his followers would not raid Algeria, and then his supporters would have attacked the French to free him. <br /> <br /> The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans. When the Americans shoot the Germans, their weapons (even the guns) make loud noises, creating great bloody bullet wounds, and their enemies are screaming for a shot. When the Germans shoot at the Americans, their weapons do not produce large noises, do not create bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produced until the early version of the M-16 came together. The force was difficult to maintain, not reliable, and the rifle bolt was always stuck. The German Mauser was one of the world's finest rifles. We were so impressed with that during the Spanish American War that we made a copy of it and called it the Springfield gun. Finally, Morocco's people should have a word for artillery when the French used them in their attack on Morocco. I didn't like it when they made Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the vocabulary of the Moors. Instead, Rasuadli told that Europeans had guns on wheels that shook the earth.
