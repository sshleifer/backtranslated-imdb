Swift socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well-run remake. (Did you know that there is no hyphen for "good"? Facts.) He meets war-like thumbnails, socialist giants, philosophers, and pacifist horses who face Yahoos - almost neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where "yahoo" came from?) We also meet the gruesome Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas, and the full cast of a truly awful 19th-century lunatic asylum. Suspension of disbelief comes easy, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Excuse the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
