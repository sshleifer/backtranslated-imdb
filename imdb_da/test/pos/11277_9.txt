I like this movie a lot. It is not very entertaining, but it is a bizarre and amazing celebration! There is no dialogue, only some background sounds and sounds. If you are in something completely different and original, and enjoy the blurry and bizarre ... then you like this work of art. I look like a movie made with the very first camera ever made, at a time when strange human beings live and perform their bizarre habits. God has killed himself with a shaver and born mother earth. Mother earth impregnated with the seed of God after an act of fellatio, and gave birth to a son "Meat of bone". What follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture, rape and murder for purposes that we do not know ... or do we?
