As the 5-year-old protagonists of his latest opus, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" hangs with his outrageous innocence as if the anime master has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that enjoys simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process. Miyazaki, reminiscent of his earlier works, paints a brightly colored world blatantly aimed at the younger audience, and the red burner strokes the grim thematic elements that separate his immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (legally promised by Yuria Nara), a fish with a young girl's face (which makes her look like a cozy kid in a pink overgrown Halloween costume) escapes away from her underwater home and her sibling school to explore the surface. Stranded ashore, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who lives with her mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) in a house on the nearby rock. This first meeting, and ultimately friendship, has a profound impact on Ponyo, who now wants to become human, but by becoming so unwittingly, the balance of nature speaks and releases a meal stream on land. With Sosuke's help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human. Despite the fact that the plot lacks the philosophical sophistication, his latest "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" says nothing less than an astounding follow-up, characterized by the meticulous attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the amazing and of the simple joys and great fears. It is a straightforward story that, although often derived from its tendency to walk like a young child, conforms to its youthful pedigree for magical confusion. "I want to protect you," says Sosuke Ponyo in fact, a childish claim that does not distinguish the way Miyazaki gives his story with artificial spirit.
