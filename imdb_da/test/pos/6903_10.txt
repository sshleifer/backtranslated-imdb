(Note: I saw I sell the dead at Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) Sell The Dead is a jet black horror comedy set on late Middle Ages, and stars Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the Rings) Ron Pearlman (Hellboy ), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). The movie opens with digger robber Willie Grimes (Fessenden), who is still horrible and unremorseful, is drawn to the guillotine and executed. His apprentice and partner-in-crime Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a whiskey-swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, pays him a visit with the apparent intention to include Blake's final notice. However, it soon turns out that Duffy's main interest lies in the more world-famous side of Blake's exploits. Most of the plot from here is told in flashback form when Monaghan directs Duffy with tales of his macabre career. In the beginning, Grimes and Blake begin as simple, clever, cracking body carvers who work in the hiring of the ghoulish Dr. Quint (Scrimm), a boring, corrupt anatomist who uses extortion as a lever over our two anti-heroes, and takes a rather unhealthy pleasure in his work. The couple have their first inflow with the undead, when one evening, Quint sends them on a mission to a gloomy moonlit bog to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously disturbed at a crossroads, apparently according to some old custom. But there is something else about this corpse. This one has been wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried with a stick through the heart ... After a frightening encounter, they not only design a plan to rid themselves of the disgusting doctor machinations, but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for equal and even better money for the living immortal living. This leads our scary duo into the hidden underworld of the "ghoul hunt" trade, where they find themselves not only vampires, monsters, and zombies (and another paranormal entity that I won't spoil the surprise of), but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I entered I sell the dead, expecting a low key, mildly distracting, low budget chiller. I was not prepared for the incredible fantasy, giddy humor, quality acting, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes me sell the dead to a strong early rival for my horror movie of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few uneven edges, the production values ​​are really great for such a low budget girl - it seems that it was made for about $ 20 million and I was surprised when the director told the audience that It was made for significantly less than half of it (though he was not willing to give precise figures as the film was still sold to distributors). The movie's "look" and tone is a visual cartoon somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with clever little Creepshow-esquire art tools. The reason is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life, but which the general population is either unable or unwilling to believe in, is one that actually gives a good sense within the context of the film . /> <br /> The play that you would expect from this cast is top notch. The characters are surprisingly widespread, especially Grimes and Blake, and all actors deliver their sharp script lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. Angus Scrimm also gets a good performance in a slightly short but memorable role as the gently threatening violin-play anatomist Doctor Quinn. Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I was so entertained by a movie. I struggle to find something bad to say about it. Mark my words, this is one of the cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still discover and fall in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.
