I was actually that Black Snake Moan was a great movie taking place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and turned up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was mistreated as a child, so he decides to take the case into his own hands by tying Rae with a chain to cure her of his evil. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together, and their performances make you believe it through their struggle and seek remission that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed at Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's girlfriend Ronnie, who is underutilized in the film, but does the best he can to deliver a good performance.
