The surface was great, I don't know how many Mondays I survived in school just by thinking of the new episode of surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mother to lose it to me. I was pretty upset when I heard it was canceled, I think you can let us go. So they can get their new Tina fay comedy (you couldn't pay me to see it, I think watching the commercials made me dumber). I will miss my Monday night fix by Surface, even though my sister made fun of me. Although kidnappers look good and they still have L&O: SVU (I think I still have to check) (I just wrote the two lines above because they said I needed ten lines).
