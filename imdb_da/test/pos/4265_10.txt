At times, ordinary news media seem to be driven by a bunch of non-brain journalists. Thus, they just listen to each other and report what others are reporting. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found if some effort is made to report something. <br /> <br /> Real journalism should be about giving people different perspectives on things that happen so they have a fair chance of creating their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary along with regular media reports will help you with this. At least for me, it provided a lot of relevant information about the purpose / motivation behind today's frequent worldwide protests at various political summits.
