Don't hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, hates her because she's fun to watch in this movie. Like hip clothes and funky surroundings, the actors in this flick work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical, and Heather Graham literally lights up on the screen. The smaller characters - Goran Visnjic {suk} and Patricia Velazquez are as TALENTED as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax & CEO Lisa Krueger!
