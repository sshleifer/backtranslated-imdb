This is another of Eastwood's many films that mix intrigue, action and a doll of romance along with "The Gauntlet", "Firefox" and so on. Clint's performance is now well known. In this he is taciturn and somewhat outrageous, especially in women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is somewhat surprising; it is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a secret service agent who, for a moment, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now joins in the bureaucracy until he is approached by John Malkovitch and calls himself "Booth" who discovers a kind of distorted relationship with him based on their common, disillusioned belief that everything is meaningless except for the impulse to escape dream and predictability. Now it's rather an anfractual set of attitudes for a performer like Clint for project, but he does quite well, less robot than normal. And he seems to be carrying him, like a stone burden, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He is tested again halfway through this movie. He hangs from the roof of a tall building, grabbed Booth's hand, and pulls his gun and points it to Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. Of course, if he does, he saves the president from an attempted murder of a CIA-trained murderer, but he does so at the expense of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold their hands in the middle of the air. And Clint even has a brief speech and talks to Renee Russo about his inability to save the president in Dallas. "If I had responded fast enough, I could have taken that shot ... and it would have been okay with me." It's underplay, but his voice shakes a little, his eyes water, and his lip shakes. It is one of the few scenes in any of Clint's movies that may be called "move". We know from his newfound decision that he gave another chance that he would take the ball this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how to "cut a nation out of the desert." Didn't they do the same in Las Vegas?) <Br /> < br /> It is often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It is not true, nothing is so simple, but one can argue for its truth value in this case. The reptile John Malkovitch with his tartar eyes is wonderful. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can skim it up a little and cheat with contempt, even though he plucks two innocent hunters between his eyes, but he is fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has a little to do. Fred Thompson, the chief white helper, is now back in politics, a relief to filming. If Clint's performance is limited, Thompson's somewhat smaller. In each movie he has been in, he carries the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if he is constantly being plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in "Das Boot", which is pretty good. There is a large part of the usual exciting cross section of the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into a creepy embrace in his hotel room and blow backwards against the bed as two weasels in heat, Peterson shows us playful feet along with a number of objects falling to the floor - not just the usual garments, but handcuffs. weapons, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments. Interrupted, Clint is left on the bed and sucks: "Now I have to put all things back." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth seeing.
