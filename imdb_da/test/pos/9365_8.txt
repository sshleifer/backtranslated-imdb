Brilliant thriller, deserves far more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are great in their lead, just as it all supports. A really gripping film noir with some fantastic pictures and a good dialogue, at the center of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film attacks post-war missionaryism and all intolerance and hatred with great power. Though parts may seem a little predictive to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock and work very well as a thriller in itself. A credit to everyone involved.
