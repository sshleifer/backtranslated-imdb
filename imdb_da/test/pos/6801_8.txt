"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl with dreams of getting into her beloved horse for competition on the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains the horse using a former jockey and parenting support. <br /> <br /> While "National Velvet" is a family movie, this should not discourage anyone who typically looks at such films with mirroring. In fact, the film is one that will appeal to the whole family, not just attentive young people. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slipping off for a general audience. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere, in that part of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was really outstanding in the role, but it is the 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also onboard is the Oscar winner Donald Crisp as Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest movie roles) as Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> The movie's bright Technicolor makes an attractive experience while editing ensured the second of the film's two Oscars. In addition, the film was nominated for its direction (by Clarence Brown), filmography and art direction. The result of the ten-year-old Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning, even though it was nominated. All in all, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I'm aware that the prospect of watching a girl and her horse watching movies doesn't exactly span some people, but this is worth taking a chance.
