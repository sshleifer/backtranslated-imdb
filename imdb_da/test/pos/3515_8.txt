I didn't have very high expectations for Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I continue to buy these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a little masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it is the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a small group of teenagers who go to the forest to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they are killed one by one by a madman. And you know what? It's just magic! It is one of the best experiences I had seen on a slasher movie. The places where it is shot are so wonderful. You can see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. It's just amazing. It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts to kill, but it didn't care! It was pleasant to see enough not to care about. What I mean is, you don't want to sit there waiting for the murders to start, because everything that happens is fun because of the beauty of the movie. The end is a little weird, but I don't want to tell you anything more about it. You know what I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: you don't care about the signs. They are not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other. Sure, they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters, but there is something special about them. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a good time watching it because I really did!
