When I first heard that the subject of Checking Out was a self-certified suicide party, my first thought was morbid, tasteless, and a comedy beyond that. I was skeptical. But I was dead wrong. I loved it completely. Cast, the fun one liners and especially the surprise ends. Suicide is a delicate problem, but it was handled very well. Comical yes, but tender where it was needed. Checking Out also deals with other common issues that I think many families can relate to, and it does with tact and humor. I highly recommend Checking Out. One must see I am looking forward to its publication to the public.
