Decalogue Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question Kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. Three men are the focus of this chapter, and Kieslowski presents the two involved in murders with traits both good and bad (in one case it is almost overwhelmingly bad). With such eerie characters, I found myself almost glad they would receive some kind of punishment. But when the time comes for the murder (and it's subsequent impact on the killer), Kieslowski chooses an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view: "Aren't you as guilty as this man?" This kind of indirect address to the audience makes the final of the Decalogue Five so much more profound as Kieslowski (As usual) does not remain within his lettering frame. Like the other parts of the Decalogue do not take their theme in the literal sense, Decalog Five does not. It asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the right punishment, if any? It's a fantastic movie and typical of Kieslowski, absolutely fantastic.
