In Belarus from 1942, two Soviet soldiers are captured by Nazi Belarussians. In captivity, the attitude of the two men to their fate is very different. One of the soldiers manages to find inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war movies in cinema history. The camera, by Vladimir Chuchnov, is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, where slow, slow, trace pictures depicting loneliness and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural Belarus set the mood perfectly. It's easy to draw a comparison with Tarkovsky's film, even more so since Tarkovsky's alter-ego Anatoli Solonitsyn has a small but important part in The Ascent. The plot is generally brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in that part of Sotnikov. The film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion that feels related to characters like Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovsky's Stalker. However, this is not a weakness in the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved. The movie's emotional wealth cannot be overstated; the answer is not as simplified as a brief overview of the plot would make you think. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationship with each other reminds one of the Commissioner, another great Soviet movie. Ascent deserves a second to see, as well as a third and a tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
