This movie was really different from what I had imagined but surpassed my expectations anyway. This movie has the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being patronizing or wisenheimer, it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist democratic high-tech society. It makes you laugh instantly and stay in the tank afterwards. For those of you who liked to "guard the dog" and wanted to have human and male politicians, this movie should definitely be the choice! "Politicians are much like diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons."
