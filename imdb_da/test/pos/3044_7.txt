Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" turns out to be something of a southern "Up The Down Staircase", but despite the teacher-against-odds formula, Conrack really moves the audience with every little breakthrough and creative flash. Indeed, these students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) have been shown learning, and their collective abundant innocence is remarkably sweet. The only real actress in the pile (Tina Andrews, a fantastic performer) plays the "hard nut" Conrack has to crack, and when she falls under her charm, it looks like a breeze. But the story is not ready for a good ending, and I was not prepared for the finite simplicity of the finals. It is beautifully done. The manuscript goes now and then, but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always fall back on Jon Voight's permanent presence. Scenes like the one in which he drives his van, fearing his frustration with a speaker, doesn't add too much, but the whole movie is full of episodes that spark emotions, and the real ending is their payout. ** 1/2 out of ****
