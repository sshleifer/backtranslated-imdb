There are only a handful of films that were made on such a large scale and made such a difference in film making. <br /> <br /> The "Bronenoset's Potyomkin" is one of those films, and it must be on everyone's list seeking to learn more about the history of the cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein instructed this groundbreaking film documenting the horrors of a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally claim against their superiors, the locals embrace them and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of the business. The following is one of the most imitating scenes in the history of the cinema. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenoset's Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie raised the bar for film production just as "Intolerance" did a few years earlier. If you don't mind silent movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you don't like silent movies ..... see "Bronenosets Potyomkin" anyway. <br /> <br />
