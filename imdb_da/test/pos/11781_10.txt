The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally out on DVD. HW has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a troubled little 20-minute card but a staple in low-cost movie production classes, which is how much of the movie's cult status is derived from and resident. With the DVD we not only get the chance to revise the original parody (4Q2, Kanel-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, et al.), Which Ernie F. did in 1978, but there is a lot of extra material that shows Fosselius . Antique Sideshow is a death-parody that is very fun, but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time. The director's comment is also hysterical, like the creativity feature, which parodies take a movie on the talk show circuit and is actually based on taking HW out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit. I would very much like to see that Ernie, Michael Wiese and the crew take some other, modern overblown and over-budgeted targets for parody - just like almost any movie that Hollywood churns out at $ 100 million a pop these days - not so much the trick movies Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parody yourself!), But any number of overblown, overhyped, overshadowed and overpriced features. <br /> <br />
