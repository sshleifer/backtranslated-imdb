... But there are also Minnies and Petes too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and cozy. Interestingly, Minnie is more lady in this than what she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now. Pete is still the same old meanie, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side signs have a lot of fun and a lot of annoyances. Even in their first appearance, the three main characters are highly developed. <br /> <br /> I like this episode, although I generally prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, steamboat and music theme, the wise gags - and of course Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it together. There is also a parrot side character which is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I don't like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode is that no color version has been made for it (or if it has, I have never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who just enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy this.
