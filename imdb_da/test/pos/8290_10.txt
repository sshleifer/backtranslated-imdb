THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE <br /> There are some movies that I could see all my life and never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was an attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. At a time when Disney dominated the movie industry in terms of animation quality and box office, CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands as one of the best animated films Disney did not produce in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is Simple and Elemental, as Alvin, Simon & Theodore compete in a worldwide race with Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor, & Brittany). But when the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are not aware that they are fines in a large diamond hoist. <br /> <br /> CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was never and never will be a movie floating thanks to an exciting plot. And for people who did not love it as a child, the film will probably never be more than an enjoyable, yet unforgettable, animated film. But for me it will always be a little known masterpiece. Something about the movie just clicks for me in a way that few movies do. <br /> <br /> Every song is fun, optimistic and harmless. Highlights include Chipettes in a slightly risqu√© Arabic dance to soothe snakes. There is also a very sweet song where Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we'll see them on big landmarks throughout the globe. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were captive without being lattice. This movie is no exception ... it's actually one of the best animated movie soundtracks from the 80s if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Each joke is sweet, sincere and entertaining. The bites between the wicked and a spoiled puppy are very entertaining. And the shock of seeing the Chipets almost forced into the marriage of an emperor is also. The comedy is constantly playing for the kids so they don't miss out on anything, but everything is still charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained. It is really just a fun trip that is totally humble in it's ambitions. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never aims to be any more, as it is harmless fun. I will be the first to admit that this is a biased notification because I have such a nostalgic love for CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I would never be able to give it a bad review ... but it still fills me with such childish satisfaction while you see it. Everyone has their childhood random favorite that no one knows, and for me this movie. And any movie I can see over and over again if I'm 5, 12, 23 or older, is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ...
