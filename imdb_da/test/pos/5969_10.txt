Reading the Comments I am struck by the obvious effect this wonderful film has on viewers. But how do you watch this movie and not reflect that the artificial dialogue was a subtle and oh so bold accusation to the authorities "in control" of what was then the Soviet Union at that moment in history? It was not just the souls of time and place of the action that was revealed. The questions, superficially, are naked provocative when directed to here and now. Who are the real "partners"? I wonder that the author was out of prison. I read a place that great stress can be a catalyst for producing good art. This movie is a masterpiece of misdirection, apparently pointing in a way while asking the audience to "look over my shoulder on what I'm really talking about." Which courage.
