yes, i noticed that there are 347 other comments, i think it is a good sign of a movie, although some are negative. I've seen this movie 2 and a half times. I love it and will see it again. It is very smart, but I can understand why some people would hate it. they do not get it to appeal. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but it's a great movie. some of the lines are as fast as the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started to die and laugh. It and when he was in the assembly line, spoke to the contact. Jewish law was wonderful, though it was humorous, he is trying to cover his wonderful accent. Still, I do not consider the movie goddess as some critics of this movie, and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual film commentaries on movies you hate online, I feel sorry. Why don't you write about movies you like, just like me. I just love how everything ties together, it keeps you guessing even if you guess you're wrong. The ending was interesting and not exaggerated. It was purely wise. I wouldn't compare it to the matrix because I think people get the wrong idea. I went into this movie expecting nothing except Jewish law and a sci-fi. I was blown away. I have no idea about any other cronenburg movie, but love it at your own profit. Another smart thing was the predation with the dog. See this movie absolutely.
