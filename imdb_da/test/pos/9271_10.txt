So totally unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention. An ordinary "Joe" (Dan) and a lot of misfit delinquents (aka Puppets) all share a home in a half house. Its job is to watch out for four "community threats" and help them rehabilitate. Bill, the homicide dummy, Rocko cigarette smoking dog, Buttons, Nympho teddy bear and Cuddles comfort doll. Five of them are in all possible odd predictions. Despite their homicidal and often obvious perverted sexual tendencies, it is difficult to find them not gracious. <br /> <br /> I give this show a 10/10, simply because it provides great entertainment without having a big budget and exudes a Canadian flair that makes me proud.
