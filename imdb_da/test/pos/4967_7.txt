I was first caught with Jennifer many years ago, but out of town when it appeared on television in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before it ended, but it stuck with me until I had to track it down. The complaint is that, although it is not much, it weaves an exciting atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (the real life trader at that time) show an amazing, low-key chemistry. Lupino plays a woman's fiancee to house-sitting a large California property whose former caretaker - Jennifer - got up and disappeared. (Shades of Jack Nicholson in Shining, though in this case, is not Lupino who goes or went mad). Duff is the guy in town who manages the estate's finances and shines at Lupino, who decides to play hard to get. She is becoming more and more involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairs and locked basements. The atmosphere and romantic city play is by far the best part of the movie, as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a letdown - there is just not so much to it (except for a little frisson in the tail that expects Brian De Palma's cinematic codas). But it is well finished and again it is with you. Extra added attraction: This is the film that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which would become part of the standard repertoire of Ol 'Blue Eyes.
