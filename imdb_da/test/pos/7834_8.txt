Forget about what you've ever read about Mallachi Brothers' straight-to-video release "Snakes on a Train", especially if it was a negative review. This movie is much more fun than the movie, which of course slips off: "Snakes on a Plane." Frankly, I am surprised that more people are not rhapsodizing about this low budget asylum. Instead, most of the reviews I have read are worth nothing sweet or critical, except for the usual stupid crew who is idiotic, as the actor was amateurish, the action did not work numerically up to the advertisement, and the whole thing was an ugly one. a waste of time. Of course, it doesn't help that the title is a tip for the obvious rip-off character of this movie. In fact, I felt that "Snakes on a Train" surpassed "Snakes on a Plane" for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the manufacturers used genuine genuine snakes for the last fifteen minutes when they replaced either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-cool snake that consumed a whole Amtrak as the train. How many movies have a snake gobble a train? The result is that "Snakes on a Train" is the first movie to scale this height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this low budget film uses some grisly-rough effects. The woman who coughs baby snakes - right - was great! The special effects of her forearms torn later in the film were visually tempting! You also see that a little white girl is eaten alive by a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or so, and she died screaming all the way, as unlucky oily giant loses snake head swallowing her. Not only children at risk, but the child eaten! This is just the kind of graphic material you won't find in 99% of all theatrical Hollywood releases. Of course she was not eaten by a real snake, but it is the subversive thought that counts. <br /> <br /> Third, it is one of the damned films that Alma (Julia Ruiz of "That Guy"), the primary female character - no heroine - has a curse on her parents because she did not marry the man they recommended. As a result, she is filled with snakes, coughing up amounts of green radiator fluid slop and chucking a baby snake up. Imagine Medusa, the mythical signs that had snakes for hair, only with the snakes in the stomach. Her psycho-shaman type boyfriend gathers all the snakes coming out of her because they are on their way to L.A. on a train to see a relative of him who can put all the snakes back in her and return her to normal. Talk about a knocked out character that performs gastric routines. Prepare for lots of slime, blood and gore. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. Nevertheless, it looked as though Mallachi Brothers filmed this above-average horror flick aboard a real train of real snakes and they played the pivotal motion of the tip on the tracks. <br /> <br /> The fifth snake slither around for the first hour, quietly infiltrating the train before they get strange and attack everyone. In other words, it is tension, excitement, excitement before people start to die from snake bites. <br /> <br /> Until the last five minutes, when the snake grows larger than the runaway train and swallows it, "Snakes on a Train" is curled, wonderful and resort. It doesn't have the attention deficit of a big league Hollywood movie. It is a fantasy of an unfortunate Latin American victim because of her feminist, odds-to-community attitude. <br /> <br /> All in all, you have thrilled fantasy-type things; Exciting snakes run around the train and are over-the-top giant snake at the end. Incidentally, they come aboard the train because a bunch of other Mexicans have overthrown a train employee, and the Mexicans aboard think the girl is so sweet that they let her and her boyfriend free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "snakes on a plane" if you want a hard, small, independently produced horror movie.
