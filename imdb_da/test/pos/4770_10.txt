The first fully synchronized audio cartoon, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse makes its screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short topic "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete whom he would later be called). Mickey manages his long time accompanying Minnie Mouse aboard the train as they rejoice while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was wildly fun and positively entertaining. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman assisted Walt on the creation of the short. "Steamboat Willie" greatly marks the start of Walt Disney Company's success.
