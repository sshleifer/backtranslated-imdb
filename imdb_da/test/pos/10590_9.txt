If you expect Jackass to look elsewhere, it is a real movie and for the budget that is well done, the play that is not top noth, nor the writing, but the director was there and then the story was actually worth rent and possibly purchase if you really enjoy it as I did. But for the person who just likes jackass, it rents first.
