I saw the first in the 70s on syndicated television and admired its production values, which were high-tech at the moment. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than the bleached 35 mm TV prints. This movie deserves more attention: It paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with detailed thumbnails and smartly thought out gadgets. Certainly, the story of an alternative planet to the earth has been reused hundreds of times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this movie is its self-conscious European style of design: from the Rolls Royce spacecraft to the "Euro Sec" stationery business paper, JFSS or Dopplegangers as It was called in Europe is fun for the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the superpowers' shadow. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious epic becomes a bit boring when the American astronaut finally realizes he's at Doppleganger Earth, and everything is literally downhill for the poetic graceful shuttle boarding sequence. A mediocre story is helped along with a great and lyrical classic score of the late great Barry Gray, John Williams of Britain.
