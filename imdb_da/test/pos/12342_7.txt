This is an OK early 80's horror flick, where a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to throw her "goody two shoes" image and becomes part of a girl gang called The Sisters. Their dedication to her is to spend the night in a mausoleum. The Mausoleum is very much the "last" resting place for some psycho-Russian psychics, and he is not dead yet. Seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck in the walls of his telekinetic practice, plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet. All evidence that hiking can be dangerous, so listen to girls. The daughter of this man (Reymar) is quite confused about his father's death and faces a man who said he knew Reymar and had a band to listen. Her hubby (Adam West, Batman's fame) is there to laugh and scoff, and not much else. But it seems that perhaps Reymar's daughter might also have some skills that she is not aware of. Unlike depositing their unhappy promise at the mausoleum, the rest of the sisters take things (like masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare crap out of her, but little suspect what is going on and they get scared out of them more than the scream. For even in death, Reymar is a bit of a busy guy, and he recharges lots of corpses for entertainment. And it also seems that he has a thing for prison bait. Overall, this is acceptable horror, nothing too intense, but not terrible either. The DVD from the Media Blasters also contains another version of the movie, which is a rough cut, I assume I am so little of it, so I do not know how different it is from the theatrical release, but from what I saw I think it's a "warts and all" presentation. 7 out of 10
