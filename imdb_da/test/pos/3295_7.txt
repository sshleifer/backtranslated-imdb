"Challenge to be free" was one of the first films I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I hadn't seen the movie this year, so yesterday I decided to keep the tape in and see it. Wow. The story is so powerful now that it was the first time I saw it. I now think I'm older, I can better write the values ​​implanted in the movie. (Self-confidence, value of freedom and love of nature) It's a "B" movie, but it's one that you can remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
