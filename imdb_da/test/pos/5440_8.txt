The film is more of a mockumentary for corruption throughout the American system. The connection between those who do not matter is then proven in the machines that stop voting a comedian to the oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic book to represent us, as we have been laughing for many years around the world. Bushism has become a lifestyle for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office no soon. Strangely, the only person of honesty is someone who is not even chosen for the position and finally tells the truth. The story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs, it doesn't happen. Means much to think. Overall, I enjoyed it.
