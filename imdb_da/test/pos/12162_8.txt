The Frozen Limits is a large screen vehicle for artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. The group's six men were mainly Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Very popular in the variety's halls, the group was also the darlings of the then royal family. The reason they see them as Wonder Boys troupe, who set out to search their fortunes in Alaska after reading about a gold speed in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally come to Red Gulch, it turns out that they are 40 years late! I often break when I see the statement "It is very British" because it means that they are not of the British Isles to fight to get it. The reason why it is disturbing to me is that at this www / internet age I have a number of non-British film-cutting friends who have been knowledgeable about sharing their pages with the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the imperious Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like the frozen borders is unlikely to be appreciated by a non-British audience? Well that's true, so much here is topically British, but it really has to be said that the classic film fan is quite well-versed in history, and when all is said and done, the visual joy here is universal. With the anarchic "not" then the West will make over an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance of being appreciated by an American audience now that it will be of a British audience. Not all comedies work, and truly, the "big 6" is trumped up for a movie stealing Moore Marriott. But there are sketches and parodies here that deserve respect and nod for approval from more famous comedy acts. You're unlikely to get down your chair like I did because of an Ovaltine gag, but if you're a classic comedy movie fan? I'm sure you'll at worst realize that there are some very talented people at work here. <br /> <br /> Now do you need to dose Mounties always get their husband? 8.10
