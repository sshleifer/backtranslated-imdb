I've never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and I can't understand why. For something that was "rushed in for ten days," everything comes surprisingly good. Although it is "Becky Sharp", a better movie and Miriam Hopkins is a better Becky, there's nothing to stop this from getting a solid 9/10. At times, Myrna Loy can seem just too cute and nice to play a full bitch, but other times she just needs to scour the eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The move to a more modern setting did not work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes a conflict is the casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was under 5 feet tall and few of the leading men were also very tall - it all comes together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's wife" in it, no matter how bad the protagonist is, you must love her. And you know she deserves her, and then some, but you still feel sad when she gets it. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the other films were almost identical. For the sake of happiness, the end of "Becky Sharp" is ultimately more fun, even though it is aesthetic, and from the history, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the best, whether you actually like it.
