I channel surfed past this many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy, so "Love American Style". However, it turned out to be quite good, very well done. The two stand-out functions are dialogue and acting. Great cast. The principle is actually well done and there are not too many weak moments. I guess what I was most amazed at was how often you thought the wheels came out of the wagon, and instead the bank just knocks the bends, so to speak, and the movie continues to fly. There are some nice little subplots, especially the relationship that develops between the character of former Conan sidekick Andy Richter. Also mention that the music accompanying it was good.
