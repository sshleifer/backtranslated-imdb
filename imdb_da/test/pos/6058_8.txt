D. I. (4 out of 5 stars) Wow, I certainly didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I had never even heard of it before I saw it sitting in the discount angle one day. I expected Jack Webb to play a drunkard instructor to be good at a chuckle, but figured that the drama would be pale in comparison to such a recent movie DIs portrayed in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and a Gentleman" . Boy, was I wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... far better than his one-seater "Dragnet" performances. The delivery of his hard guy dialogue is just brilliant ... done in his patented deadpan monotonous and yet you * know that the guy means every word of it. The story may seem a little hokey to the gritty military films that have followed, but I still found the film fascinating and convincing. Even a completely unnecessary musical interlamer in a military nightclub had connected me. Anyone know where to get a copy of the amazing Ray Coniff song "If'n You Do Not, Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest dang training instructor ever ... and he's under pressure to kick out the dead private Owen, but with golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he'll pull him out and kick and scream! Good cases!
