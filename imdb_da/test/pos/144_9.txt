The priest, in deep love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has man-made beauty (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> And the love of Femme Fatale is not infamous but lovely in taking responsible death as a vampire. She did not continue to fall deep into Paradise lost, but decided to leave man alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This film made me think of suffering between man and vampire, far beyond the priest and salvation. I also thought of love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but this Adam (priest), sacrifice and responsible for choosing Eve from Paradise Lost, the world of vampire. Another symphonic lady Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.
