I don't have much to say, but it's a fantastic finish to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and it's just eye candy. But thinking about it, everything was explained in FFVII, you can't add more plot to a great story it would ruin it. They did the best they could do, and I think this should be taken more like a final FMV .. the last match. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Fantastic <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - Don't think they could expand it so much more. And the things they could put in there were clever enough, I thought. <br /> <br /> Draw 9/10 - Most people have already been explained during the game, but still couldn't fit it all for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 since I'm metal fan I loved the fight music .. and piano just right there. It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Entertaining every time. <br /> <br /> All in all - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's necessary, a battle to finish everything .. the plot was already in place. The action was needed as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the FFVII world just one last time. Just remember this .. Most movies made by a game have been directed by movie directors, I think it's pretty good for a team of gamblers .. Don't think I've seen a better game for movies .. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square, I think you did it right!
