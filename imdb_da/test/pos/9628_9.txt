"Five Fingers of Death" started the American Kung Fu movie, but I remember seeing it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, NYC, without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I was also fortunate enough to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers of Death" in Times Square, NYC. What contrast it turned out to be ... same movie but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this movie took a more serious note to the viewers. It was because of the real voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this movie more credible. Chinatown theaters this year showed violent kung fu movies (1972's "Boxer From Shantung" beat them all), so action choreography and history were the main attraction. Rival schools were not yet used, but the story seemed fresh. Every great Kung Fu movie had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and FFoD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. Most Chinese audiences enjoyed this movie tremendously. The audience buzz while leaving this movie gives me the ultimate satisfaction. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentional. I enjoyed it here too but for various reasons. The audience was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard these strange British accents coming from the Chinese actors, the movie became a fierce and gymnastic cartoon. Most American audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror movie that wasn't in an action movie. The action sequences blew away the audience. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad duplication and unnecessary violence became a Kung Fu girl formula. <br /> <br /> I had fun watching this movie with an American audience, but enjoyed it more in Chinatown. Some movies may pass the time test, but the copied version of FFoD cannot. The original "King Boxer" is still fun ... a classic!
