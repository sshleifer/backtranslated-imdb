Anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love <br /> <br /> this movie. Taken from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it's a fun <br /> <br /> and ultimately monstrous analysis of a relationship between two "actorly" types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic <br/> <br /> Shakespeare actress who hardly sees the world war raging around him, so he intends on his theatrical fortunes <br /> <br /> The company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is fighting as Norman, the title 'Dresser' whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless. <br /> <br /> Really a must see.
