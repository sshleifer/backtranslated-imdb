I'm not asking you. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction of being one in a series of Madonna movies that bombarded, but I really liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan" Madonna's character is relegated to being second bitch to Rosanna Arquette and does not get much to work with. Not disrespectful to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, monstrous character, performed only in the 80s style. Although it may seem like "cheesy" today, it is actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated movies. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con sent to slam for a crime she did not commit. She is released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from prison to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, that's when madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a large manor in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This movie parodies everything. The rich people, the shabby characters who live in Harlem, and totally destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne's burnt fiance Wendy Worthington, who has allegedly slept with every taxi driver in New York City (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend Caroline in sixteen candles). Hysterically fun! Plus, Dunne is also responsible for a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". Plus, Madonna had a fantastic platinum blonde 80s looking back these days and the movie has a good soundtrack. Throw it all into the mix and you have WTG's zaniness. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. There are times in the movie where she says a line quite and surprisingly, it turns out to be fun! It is so that some of the best comedies have to be played - right. Madonna should have done more comedy, and it was a pity she didn't choose to do it. Later, she became much more controversial and entered several of the dark, sexually charged roles in the infamous movies "Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". <br /> <br /> Some say Madonna can't act and that's fine, people are right about their opinion, but I think the real problem is that people can't see the difference between Madonna playing a sign of film , instead of the Se still only Madonna, and that is the main reason she gets more respect for her music than for her movie. It's still a fun, screwball comedy from the 80s. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you won't like it, so I'd recommend it mainly to Madonna fans, but you never know you can be surprised and like it! <br /> <br /> Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from her 80-year-old New York club day, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the band Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
