I almost enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and tells Roch Carrier captured all the boy's feelings perfectly. From the emotions he had for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, expectation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon to see horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leaf sweater was priceless and shameful to wear this horrible (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leaf sweater; Don't blush, bleu and blanc from the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old sweater. And best of all, his mother made him wear this Maple Leaf sweater out of the house. You could imagine and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing the shirt before he came there. <br /> <br /> I laughed all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen. <br /> <br />
