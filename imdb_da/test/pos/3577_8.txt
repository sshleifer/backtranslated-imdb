"The bad dreams always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who, along with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a large, mid-Victorian estate. "And last night I found myself in Limmeridge cemetery. Normally they are dead dead, just as usually they are criminals who are unlocked rather than victims. But then there was nothing normal about what happened to us .." And We are away from a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villain, based on Wilkie Collin's great Victorian mystery novel. It is a good idea to pay attention because there are plots of land, but they are all centered on a cunning and ruthless scheme involving what more money, lots of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are devoted to each other. Marion is hard and protective; Laura is softer and more romantic. Marion does not have its own money; Laura will inherit wealth when she comes to age. Marion has no marriage perspectives that we know of; Laura has been promised once to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an all too charming aristocrat. They are their uncle's departments, a fussy, degrading, immensely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is committed to teaching them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he comes to the local train station at night, there is no wagon, so he goes out to the yard. In the dark forest he meets a foreign woman, dressed in white, wandering about and talking about things he does not understand who disappears. Are we troubled? Yes, and he and the sisters come to realize that the strange woman is like Laura. Later, love between Walter and Laura arises? Does a bud bleed? Is there a misconception that sends Walter away and results in Laura getting married to Sir Percival? Gnawing a canker? And tell secrets slowly about the relationship between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions ... will we enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and do we finally discover the depth of corruption, as well as the reverence and true love that mankind is capable of? Do we visit Victorian crazy asylum searches, see falls from high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and see retaliation arrive in the middle of a locked church? S roaring flames? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a great journey for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features fine actors and outstanding production values. To fit Collins' 500-plus-page novel into a less than 120-minute TV show, a good deal would have to be cut or shortened, and some changes were most likely to gain greater influence in the modest time. Still, the production of The Woman in White works in my opinion very well as a moody, romantic, dark television story. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a performance as a woman who is determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever achievement of slowly letting us see the corrupted mucus under the skin, which still has charm in the midst of the villain. Ian Richardson as the young woman's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a powerful and sharp performance that the almost unbalanced story every time he looks. Perhaps the weakest are the main parts Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, yet a very civilized and charming one. Collins described him as being of enormous circumference. Callow does a fine job of it, but for me he lacks a little of the evil of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian tells us, "My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels, we sometimes seem like we were in them." Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura.
