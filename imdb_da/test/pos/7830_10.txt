This is one of the funniest movies ever made. And for those of you who don't, it should be fun. So often, comedies come to be so intentionally fun that they miss, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being fun in the most subtle ways. Even "spoofs" lack the originality and the natural feel of this movie. It's a comic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios perform this kind of thing regularly. kudos to decision makers, and to a hilarious subtle cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are top notch. Really a real break-out star performance of a true underrated scene actor. It will be great to see this guy get his fault.
