The film is based on a Jules Verne book I actually read about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot and this film does a great job of telling the story. The most important thing in this movie is not the story, but the very original visual look it has. <br /> <br /> The picture is absolutely beautiful and apparently achieved by a smart combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets painted so they look a lot from an animated movie. Combined with Jules Verne's own unique versions of aircraft and submarines, and Karel Zeman's excellent instruction results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to keep an eye on the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some issues too, one of the underwater scenes at the end may take an unnecessary amount of time, for example, as the story in the first part of the movie is being moved through quite quickly. None of this is very important as the film is always very entertaining. A gem that deserves to be known to today's audience. A recommended movie for the whole family.
