Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film just tells a story of a snapshot within one of these subcultures. It's basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people who live their lives ignorant of the rest of the world. Generally a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought and showed life that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own backyard. Must be seen by everyone. Having lived in the United States all my life, I had no idea that there was a citizen here who did not know they were citizens. This movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: If this really is too true, then what is out there that we do not know?
