This is a great movie. When two people with different backgrounds and social status believe they have nothing to offer each other, and eventually they need each other as a testament to what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa, and the outer appearances say one thing to our eye, but what they offer each other from within, which we cannot see, is amazing and inexplicable. When Nimi felt that Matthew had nothing to offer her, and when Matthew only searched for a flake (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), they eventually came in for not being able and unwilling to exist without the Other . It was worth it for them to resist what family and friends thought, and what society it was right to be with each other. This movie kind of restores my belief in love.
