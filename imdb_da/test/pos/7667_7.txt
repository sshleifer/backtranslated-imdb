Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /> <br /> It was most directly a mock up of the classic 1970s favorite, "The Sonny & Cher Show". With Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney, a sign show biz couple who somehow was forced to host this program played together the couple of the couple claiming the tap and the constant barring of "insult humor" as the couple teamed up with each other, plus sketches of comedy pieces and performances from the most friendly names like "special" acts! <br /> <br /> "Hybrid" was the mix of facts and imagination. Of course, there was no "Mr. and former Mrs Laupin", and the program advertiser Johnny Bluejeans was also as fictitious. But all the actions that were done were just right, and some were even entertaining! But there were also some actions that would clearly have been better suited to the old Chuck Barris "Gong Show". <br /> <br /> The show itself was really more like an extended sketch from "SCTV" (it was worn from the MTV series "State") and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five minute bit in the mix of a program like one, rather than an independent series. But "Viva Variety" should surely get high marks for original concepts, and even though it was often more odd than fun, it was definitely worthwhile, especially as they went to Las Vegas and made even more sparkling actions. It is unlikely that we will ever see anything like this on TV again.
