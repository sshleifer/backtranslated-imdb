SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and thought-provoking movie, and I could have seen Tom Wilkinson on the screen forever. The location on the English landscape, the amazing London locations, the interior, the wardrobe and of course the writing and dialogue made SEPARATE LIES an exciting adventure. With that said, and perhaps this is just an American point of view, as the British are so much more sophisticated in dealing with sexual escapades, I found it hard to see Tom Wilkinson just passing by as his wife pleasantly walks in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy, creating much despair for her husband, with the cad who is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw Wilkinson's character - his goal of perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness to realize what she has thrown away. Tom Wilkinson makes SEPARATE LIES a strong movie by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment and despair on the screen when his wife leaves with another man. And he himself makes the journey on SEPARATE LIES by understanding his mistakes and embracing his wife after all, what has gone and leading her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
