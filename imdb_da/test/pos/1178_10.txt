Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have to be one of the best friends ever to work together. They have made lots of movies together, I think they are both great when working together in a movie. Outside the sea is a great comedy movie I think I see. I give the film 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on TV. Unfortunately, they are missed. God bless you both.
