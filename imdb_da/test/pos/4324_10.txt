First of all, I just have to say I'm a big lost fan. Everyone who does the show, I love them. It has everything in it. Really. I am glad that they have good people who do it, for example Jack Bender is the greatest instructor, yes maybe after J.J. Abrams. And of course, full credit to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. In any case, the Season 2 Final is definitely one of the best episodes of ever lost !!! Live Together, Die Alone focuses on Desmond David Hume's story of coming to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so great to play that character! The actors decision makers would have been very stupid if they would have let old people die on us. <br /> <br /> So in the LOST, the plane crashes have survived 65 days .. 65 days, man. Whilea's Rousseau has been there for SIXTEEN years and the others have been there for God knows how long. Reference to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway I hope we get the answers we need in season 3. Can't wait! My vote is nine.
