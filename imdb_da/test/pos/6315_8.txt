The Consequences of Love: There is really something special about this movie, but it is very difficult to put your finger on. It's a kind of love story, but not really one I've seen before. It has several love themes that run throughout the film. A man loves a younger woman, a younger man loves his older brother, mafia's love of money at all costs, it's just some who interfere in a story that you guess or rather don't know where and how it will end. The molding is all excellent from Sophia, the legal barmaid to the straight look, watching the central character of the film. With a simple but affective camera work, an ever-changing soundtrack shot that blends low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces. The movie's style changes beautifully by using multiple styles without being ringed. Love has never looked as diverse and powerful as the narratives we are told mess to various conclusions. The director has married old and new to a rich Italian classic.
