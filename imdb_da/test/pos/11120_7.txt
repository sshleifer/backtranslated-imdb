Film follows a bunch of students in NYC High School of Performing Arts. There is Coco (Irene Cara) a black singer who will make it to the top after all. She is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) a white musician. Then there is Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress - but she is shy and scared. She befriends Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - allegedly the only gay student in school and is romanced by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there is Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who was sadly seated in 2003) who is homeless and a great dancer - but can't read. Then there are different teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stands out) trying to teach the kids. <br /> <br /> The songs are STORE (the title line and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for Best Song - "Fame" won), the dancers are energetic and the young cast shows lots of ambition and talent. BUT this movie misses the boat in the drama department. Many plot lines are brought up and completely back open at the end of the movie. Why did Coco make a porn? Was Doris and Raul remained together afterwords? Did it either? What about Montgomery - what happened to him? And did Leroy ever do an exam - and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that just lead to nothing. I assume there were cuts in the script - I can't believe the movie has just left all this open. <br /> <br /> It's still worth watching for the play and again the music. There is virtually no bad song, and the dancers go in full force (and at some point stop the traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", which is a good closing song. So I recommend it but can only give it a 7 - script really need to bind loose ends - and it didn't. <br /> <br /> Trivia: They wanted to separate this movie into the actual school of the Performing Arts, but could not get permission. The dean at the school read the manuscript and said there was too much gang in the movie. It's true - there is a lot of foul language, but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version, which abysmally overdubs it.
