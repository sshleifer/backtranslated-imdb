This lesser-known movie by Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It was made at a time when history was more important that the special effects (although the effect is quite good for its time). A scientist theorises that there is another world in Earth's Orbit just behind the Sun. As the sun always blocks it from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is chosen to go on a mission to come to this world. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give away the rest of the movie. Let's just say there are some real surprises. The film is British and has the good British taste experience that was in such TV series as The Avengers.
