Watch this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heartbreaking and scary at the same time when he says it from the beginning to the end. This movie made him famous, and I highly recommend it: D It is very entertaining, the music is evil and you will laugh right with Shahrukh here ... You will really feel scared of the hero and heroine, and you will probably notice you with at least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy and relieved and scared at the same time. Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and some nice food and take a day. And after watching the movie, you must have the songs and scene in your heart ... forever.
