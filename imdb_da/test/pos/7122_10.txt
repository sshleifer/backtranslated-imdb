This movie captures the brilliant atmosphere of a D&D group. While I was watching, I couldn't help but notice where living signs reminded me and my game friends of the point where they acted literally the same as we do. Including bickering, the fighting, the internal jokes, the DM did badly. Everything. <br /> <br /> It has it all. Witnesses that made me cry, action scenes that even filmed in the low budget, I found extremely amazing. The story is quite straightforward and surprising, but it doesn't matter as the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play D&D or similar RPG, I can't stress it enough. SEE THIS MOVIE, It Captured Beautifully The D & D's Spirit.
