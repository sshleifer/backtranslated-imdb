Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie in my youth. Elton and his organizer Paul Buckmaster singer replay forever ... If you know where to find a VHS in the movie, email me !! My husband for 26 years and I saw this as juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend so and continues to be. I think we both wept our eyes out. I think we were drawn to the movie of the Elton John music in it, but was then swept away by the teenage anxiety of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our ages when we saw the movie - so very easy to identify with !! It is great to hear that Sean is fine, I am also in "helping the professions" (an RN). I thought his performance was good and very credible. "Michelle" came across as very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the "real world", they could be happy and continue to fall in love. How many times have we all wanted a "Calgon torque". If we all had no external concerns and could only handle our "basic needs", it could be somewhat easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and would not have a problem with her watching this movie. Children look so much worse these days that this is very tame. For those of you who are trying to find the CD, my husband (a great Elton John fan) was able to get a 2-CD set that came out in 1992. It's called "Elton John Rare Masters" Polygram Studios. This has all friends songs as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with the "Friends" music. We also had LP years ago and were thrilled to find the CD. Good luck. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the "young love" theme. I just wish it was on DVD now !!
