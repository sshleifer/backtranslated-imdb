Treading Water is a very beautiful movie. I'd put it right under the wonderful short film: Cosa bella from Fiona MacKenzie. It's not just about getting out, but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Laurel Heaven's work in the future. Actors Angie Redman and Nina Landey are pretty good. The main character relationship could have been slightly strengthened as we understand that there is a very strong bond between them, but perhaps it could have been explained a little. I'm surprised Angie Redman doesn't look much like other movies. A good first step as director of Laurel Heaven, I'm sure there's more to see from his skills.
