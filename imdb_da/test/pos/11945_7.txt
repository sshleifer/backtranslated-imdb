This movie is a bit like "Better Off Dead" as it has some of the same stars. However, this one is not quite as good. Permitted, it's quite fun and enjoyable, there's something about "Better ... I like better here. This guy has these guys for Nantucket to spend there summer vacation. While meeting this girl trying to save this house from this guy who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant, this guy doesn't really look like lobster, because in a scene he sticks it into boiling water and puts a stethoscope so he can hear the scream, the protagonist is torn between this girl and the girl from the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant, somehow it leads to a big boat race showdown, just like in "Summer Rental", although it works a little better here and fits into the grounds is a little better. What about boat racing at this time? Were there any strange fascinations with them? For the most part, this movie is a good clip, but "Better Off Dead" was still better because it was the first and the jokes worked better.
