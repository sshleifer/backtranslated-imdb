I have taken a look at this movie and still consider it good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that can really trade. She occasionally appears in the soft core as "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I also thought Nicole Hilbig was okay with her lovely body and charming accent. Too bad, she's not in several movies.
