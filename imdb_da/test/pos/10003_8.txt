Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US Gulf open and made a movie about much more than an extraordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the tensions of the early twentieth century and affects the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American institutions. But in the heart, the film is about the multi-year favorite in triumph against the odds. <br /> <br /> The action is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the film is Shia LaBoeuf, who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class French-Irish child struggling through prejudices from the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of his maturity is a wonderful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old caddy threatens to steal every scene where he looks. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear control and a great story that grabbed the end - the final scene a loving nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fills a fantastic movie.
