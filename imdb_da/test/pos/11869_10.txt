This movie makes me laugh by just thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise yet easy. casting can't be better. All actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play the very best, and there is no silly laughter or shouting through the whole movie. teams and the history of the past work perfectly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. The biggest of all is when the Village People's YMCA is cued in, it brings out the importance of the Indian statute, which was first briefly brought up earlier in the film, making it the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. I give it a ten, especially many times, comedies are so undervalued.
