Before I saw the sneaky example today of angels and demons, I cleared the thought of any uncertainties that could keep me from enjoying it; the huge amount of hatred against Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is on all the posters. I went in with an open mind and expected it worse, but instead I got a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that's in every way good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film hangs loosely on the actual story itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) nozzles to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and re-election through papal conclave. Organizing all this is Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). But he quickly learns about a new threat, one involving a secret fraternity, an anti-material time bomb, which the Vatican is now targeting and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, who uses his intellect (and trusts me, will hear a lot of it) will be tasked with finding and saving them through the mysterious path of illumination. Using the CERN researcher Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of anti-matter, he helps him. <br /> <br /> The film itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss guard jump to rescue a branded cardinal. The next moment he drills you with meaningless information about every random object he passes, which obviously slows down the book's expected action / thriller sequences. It provides an interesting reading on paper, but on the screen it can go either. <br /> <br /> The character is decent written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor makes a compelling performance like the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent. Tom Hanks is a bit more flexible, intellectual and physical since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays commander Richter, the straightforward leader of the Swiss guard. Unfortunately, neither his or Ayelet Zurer's performance is worthy, and instead of playing a role in history, they are just being saved as assets. <br /> <br /> But angels and demons get what DVC never could; an exciting, fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreation in St. Peter's Basilica and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a vibrant bomb that counts down the midnight. Ron Howard does a decent job of managing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism and almost complete exchange of the dull dialogue for tense chases (almost). <br /> <br /> While novices may call it a "National Treasure 3" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious thriller / thriller eye candy and brilliant still images of Rome to breathe. Fans of the book may feel different to the dramatic changes of the movie, but given the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D makes it extremely good at keeping the viewer locked on the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder. <br /> <br /> A good book-to-movie fit that both appeals and entertaines. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
