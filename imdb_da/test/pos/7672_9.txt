I stumbled upon this site as I was looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 Porgy and Bess version with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If anyone finds this on a home movie format, let me know. I always talk to my daughters about things that they think are new, which have actually been done. We went to see a live theater of version a couple of years ago and all I could talk about was this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters cannot remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in some production, even if they have heard of him. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other major actors in the film. It is a great overview not to have this classic movie (because of the cast) on a home environment format for collectors and future generations. Anyway, in my opinion, this version was the best!
