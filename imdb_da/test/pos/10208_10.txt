Fritz Lang instructed two major Westerners: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". Frank James movie is similar to "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerns. I've never seen Robert Young in a Western before; He is great as a telegraph employee. This is the only movie I can think of, it's about the telegraph company opening up in the west. It is a high-geared story of telegraph in the west, a triangle of love history and loyalty. <br /> <br /> The support molding is fantastic. Dean Jagger, who made a few Westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is the interest of love in the film. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in film. She stopped filming in 1952 and became a drama trainer. She is primarily known as the first wife of Yul Brynner. It's nice to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other amazing films: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
