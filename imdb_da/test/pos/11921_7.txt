Yes, it's not a great cinematic performance, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. The young cast does a great job with both dramatic and comical aspects of history, and I especially liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I've seen this a lot of times over the years, and will probably see it more more. Just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy it!
