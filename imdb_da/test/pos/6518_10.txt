Wonderful family movie that should be a staple at Christmas time. It is a mystery to me why it is not. A real lost movie that I first encountered flickered on my old 19 "black-and-white RCA when Million Dollar Movie was still in fashion on Channel 9 in New York City. This Rudolph Mate-directed fantasy should be placed underneath everything Christmas tree, but it has never been released on home video, I think I saw some of it on the AMC some years ago before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. Any movie with Santa, Aunt Bee, Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actress with the first name King can't be bad, Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energy, she jumps over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann's Help and give guidance to her mixed and financially strapped family, so it works, then, after graduating, she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom, at one point the entire O'Moyne residence has moved to another address. I think it was ok place to put an end to a neighbor's dispute between O'Moynes and the shabby guy next door. Blyth is cute like a button. Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All in all, this is a satisfying movie experience.
