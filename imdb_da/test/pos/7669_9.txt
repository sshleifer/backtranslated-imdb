I had the pleasure of recently looking at this beautifully recorded widescreen adaptation of the 1943 scene revival (as opposed to the original 1935 production), which included extensive spoken recitals. This had been fashion at the time, so blaming the film for a 16 year tradition. The movie should be seen if only for Sammy Davis Jr's brilliant cat-like performance like Sportin 'Life, creeping in and out of shadows. His seduction by Dorothy Dadridge's BESS "There is a boat data leavin 'soon for New York," is one of many highlights. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. It certainly never lives as the latest PBS and MET versions did. It was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the film, and hopefully it will be available in the near future for those generations who have not had the opportunity to experience it.
