Before I see this movie, I suggest the viewer removes any expectation that the victims of the crimes depicted will receive equal treatment and consideration as the offender. There have been many films about victims of crime. One is about the killer. "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: There are no crack lawyers going to save William Poncelet and no dramatic story turns. The film is not trying to put him in a good light; he is guilty of being contradictory, a racist, and responsible for horrific murders. On the basis of all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being despite his crimes. In this way, the film challenges the idea that the death penalty provides "justice". Whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption, inequality in the legal system and the appropriateness of the death penalty. Great performances by both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the film's last moment shows the true depth of Penn's ability.
