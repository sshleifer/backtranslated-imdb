When I watched this movie for the first time, I didn't believe in my own eyes. In front of me there was a big and well done parody of Valentino ... see Stan Laurel bullfighting that way is like seeing an excellent fender in action! It's a very good parody, rich in ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... old and good as whiskey. (or the blast after that)
