Watching the Preview of Armored I thought the movie would be a very bad or very good movie. Fortunately, the film was entertaining, exciting and realistic. There is never the perfect crime, and the armor showed why. The movie shows perfectly when people come in stressful situations, they behave like animals. The last hour in the movie is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Difficult to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I wanted to buy this movie. I give armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. Did I write ten lines yet? Nix! Yet there are not many action films. Armored has a lot of excitement in it, giving the film a choice over another comedy.
