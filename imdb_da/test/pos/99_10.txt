This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I've ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artificial with its camera angles and beautiful in its style, and skillfully recreating the short story with the same name written by a master of short stories Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> Do not want to spoil any of the movie, I do not go into any other details than to say that this film is magnificent in itself. It is proud of what it does and does well. It shows the most important memories in life, all of which can be summarized by the most unpleasant feeling: unexpected bliss. This film, with its own will, has created in me the same feelings felt by the protagonist (Tom Noonan) when words transformed his existence and it is an impressive experience.
