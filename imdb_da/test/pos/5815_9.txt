Although it may not be Cassavete's best work, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all of their efforts. The plot is moody and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive selection of emotions - much more drama than comedies, unlike IMDb's profile. Yes, the story is moody, but not arbitrary; It succeeds as credible, albeit a bit forced - as I will come back to. All the artistic aspects are of true Cassavetes form: cinematography and camera work are delights, and the soundtrack - albeit almost there - is free. And I think I've noticed some nods to Godard and such in the editing - as I have in a couple of Cassavete's other movies - (the sudden cutting of a song in a scene) that is interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel the plot is neatly built, with the first half being particularly fun. For example, Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) at the eatery is wonderfully fun and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. This philosophy - a tradition in Cassavete's film - is what made the movie to me. Seymour's entertaining and profound monologues immediately eliminate the first impressions that one can have of him as a hippie simp - even though his character is curiously similar to his face (1968). This, however, struck me (by other view) in the opinion that it stands for Cassavete's best work. I got a love for this movie, which I lacked at first view. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this movie incomplete. I find the plot to be unbalanced. As I said before, it builds nicely, but it fades slightly here and there, especially towards the end. Because of the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and especially the freedom that he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either. In this case, it is inconsistent. I think most of this movie was improvised, and mostly beautiful. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. Especially after the scene Seymour struggles with Minnie's work outside her house. Under what is supposed to be the movie's most intense scene, Cassavete's allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue - provided some were planned in advance. I think this was a mistake. You get the impression Cassel does not quite know what to do, as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech, often does not make sense and supremacy; All this destroys the stage and character development. I understand that Seymour is supposed to be a bit of a brash stupid, but Cassel's attempt here is mistakenly used. Why does he cut his mustache? These errors are due to: Lack of direction on Cassava's part; a lack of understanding and thought on Cassel's part; lack of repetition and preparation, etc. It was obvious that Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes when he allowed the same in his next film, "Woman Under the Influence" (1974) - the committed scene and ending. <br /> <br /> The errors I mention are no less, but they do not destroy the movie. They simply do some scenes that are dignified and unrealistic, destroy the film's flow and compromise its potential. However, I am very fond of Cassavete and all his actors, especially Cassel, despite the mistakes I mentioned. This is a very entertaining movie, although it turns out that Cassava's style is uncertain.
