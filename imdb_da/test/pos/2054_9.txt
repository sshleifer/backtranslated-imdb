I had never heard of this movie before it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena expels Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a teacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues the life for 8 years with a man and a daughter. Clues starts coming to her that she might have been someone else, especially when someone is trying to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and wants to make sure she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they form a couple who are as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally recovers her memory, she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine, once with the song "She's Not There" in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad and hopefully stay alive. Through the rest of the movie, Geena has to decide who she really is. It kills unfeeling machine? Mother / teacher with quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the evil one grabs Geasa's daughter. Big action scenes that match any of the Die Hard movies!
