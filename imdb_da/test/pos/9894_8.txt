Peter Falk shines like 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, the patriarch, who has decided it's time to "check out" after holding a final blow-out bash. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold are announced / invited by. Letter and come straight to the door to handle their eccentric father. There is a large father / daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character happens to get the greatest growth from the test. It is a well-rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pain, growth and ignorance / tolerance of each other's life. The musical score is one that you will enjoy and one liners is well-timed and fun. Although I found the actual "Checking Out" party a light down, the rest of the movie is sure to make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move over "Big Fat Greek Wedding" .... "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has arrived.
