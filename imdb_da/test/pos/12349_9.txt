I actually first saw One Dark Night in the theater and wrote a review of the movie to my high school newspaper. I loved it then & I still love it. The story is about two people. First of all, a woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death. She has feelings about her father's powerful powers even in his death. The mauseleum he is buried in plays host to the other protagonist, a high school girl does something to get in with a group of girls who just want to torment her and dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group. They go back at night to scare her and find scares for themselves. Cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles by Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Check out this one if you love 80s movies and cheesy horror movies, you won't be dissatisfied.
