Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor working today. Her chameleon depictions never fail to marvel; she actually seems to be the characters she brings to the screen. In "A True Thing" she gives life to a wild, deeply complex woman who does her best to play the hand that life has treated her. Survival with cancer is not an easy task, and not just survival, but actually continues to live one's life is even more difficult - and that's exactly what Kate Gold (Streep) means to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only keeps her own in this exalted company, but shines like Streep's daughter, who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own. Streep is a power plant and received an Oscar nomination for her work here; her "I will only say this time", the dialogue with Zellweger will leave you ruined. Zellweger, however, is the real revelation - her face transmits all emotions, any conflict, as she begins to learn the many truths about the parents' strengths and weaknesses. Director Carl Franklin ("Devil in a Blue Dress") handles the extremely difficult story material with sureness and delicacy.
