Nicole Finn (Madonna) is just released from prison. Although she is ordered to take a bus to Philadelphia, she will stick to the place she was arrested. This is because she claims she has information that would clear her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) escorted her to the bus of her future son-in-law. Louden will still drive around the city (in his future mother-in-law, Rolls Royce), pick up the wedding ceremony and a rare big cat for an eccentric collector. However, Nicki starts the subsequent chaos as soon as she jumps in the rollers to take over the run. Between big cats, taxi drivers, hit men, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns, Louden's lawyer says he's no longer in Kansas. Is there a way out of madness? This movie is a wild ride down comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunneare perfect foils for each other, making their connection troubled as they play their roles as an ex-con and an uptight, down-down lawyer, respectively. The script is commendable in its ability to send the viewer to the subtleties of hysteria, as an unlikely scene provides space for the next and the next. Everything else, from the supporting actors to the nature to the costumes, is also pretty nice. If you know someone who needs a scream of joy, hire this movie for them. You will both be cheerio pronto.
