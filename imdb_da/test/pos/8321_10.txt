And frankly it just sums it up. <br /> <br /> It's a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an expensive documentary. <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (I thought the long-necked dinosaurs eyes looked fake). <br /> <br /> But some of the model shots didn't look so realistic ... and I thought Jurrassic Park made a better T Rex .. <br /> <br /> If this is the kind of thing we see on a normal British television series, I can't wait to see what they can achieve in the movies. <br /> I give this 10/10 stars ... <br /> <br /> The video of "making of" was also fantastic ..... dinosaur on the skateboard was halaric) <br / > <br /> <..>
