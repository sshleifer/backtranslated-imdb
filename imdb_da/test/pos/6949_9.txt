This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torno and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with music, scenery and reality in the film are quite convincing. A look at a true, tell it as if it is logging, mountaineer who refuses to give up his lifestyle in propulsion and development. Horseflies music is very unique and adds a scary quality to some of the scenes. After watching this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy the video and audio track. All in all, a quiet type of movie with outbreak of panic. Both the reef and the cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
