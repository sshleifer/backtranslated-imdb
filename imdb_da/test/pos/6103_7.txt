Even worse, she has to live with herself in what she experienced almost every day the little girl's family, she drove down Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer, who goes to the same school as her two daughters Mindy & Holly, Gretchen Esau & Kira Posey. Joanna's life begins to come apart as she tries to keep the truth from her friends and family, not to mention Eaton Police, about what she was involved in a little Kelly's accident. <br /> <br /> You can easily see how the words of her friends and neighbors as well as her husband Doug, Drew Phillbury, about hit and run, performed Joanna. These were the words that Joanna was unable to bring herself to admit to what she had not only for her own concern but also her two daughters and her husband. Feelings of being scolded by the people they knew as friends as well as neighbors for years. <br /> <br /> Joanna on the verge of losing her thoughts trying to imply her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, in Kelly's hit-and-run accident by trying to plant her ear that she lost in Joanna's house at the accident site.
