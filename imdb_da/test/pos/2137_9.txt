I'd like to walk around in a museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the most important composer, Michael Cimino & this amazing art of desinger of light .. Vilmos Zsigmond. As I said, I was like being in heaven and discovering the whole creation that this man can apply to a single frame. Imagine when you can see a moving picture of this artist. I can say: this movie is one of the best.
