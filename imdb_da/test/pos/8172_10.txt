After growing up a Mormon and seizing the church's bigotry against blacks (they were not allowed to keep the church priesthood when I was a member) - I was not aware of the organizations policy to exclude gay men and women until I left the church in 1966 - (I was 20.) I was stunned when I learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after being on missions. LATER DAYS reveal Mormon's persecution of gay members. The movie is LONG delayed. It does an excellent job of showing how the two leading men are expressed, while steering to grow and develop more fully as individuals. LATTER DAYS has great heart, wonderful original music and an extra touch of class from Jacqueline Bisset. The film tells the story of an individual who leaves the boundaries of the organized religion and regains his soul.
