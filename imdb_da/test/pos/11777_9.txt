I just got the Hardware Wars DVD in a shiny new package that looks irresistible. Put it in my DVD player to find a lot of extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who have (shame!) Never seen Hardware Wars, it's a terribly stupid Star Wars spoof (of Episode IV, of course). Household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and a waffle maker) stand for thieves, X-wings, R2D2 and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairdresser. You get points, I'm sure. Mad stupidity and a fun trip to any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, DVD - wow! A director's commentary on which he basically goes to the film makes it fun of himself and the project through. An interview with Fosselius about Creature Features (remember it?!) And hilarious "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (all jokes of course). It's good anyway. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and I'm so happy to have the DVD in my collection - squeezed between the MST3K: movie and Thumb Wars!
