Stanwyck at his fateful best, Robinson right here - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western. <br /> <br /> Some great action scenes, strong use of location, color and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of stock footage in the stamped scene? Ford is reliable as always, and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the evil movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly bursting villain as Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer. See it for the camp value.
