George Scott gave life's performance in Paddy Chayefsky's HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging metropolis hospital and a medieval doctor on the verge of suicide. At the same time, Diana Rigg comes as a free spirit determined to save him from herself. Their dialogue breaks and it is clear that they are made for each other right from the start. But will she save him? Their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for their passion and rage. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who do not want it to transform a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is loose in the hospital that specializes in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the film is entirely focused on Scott. As it should be. What a difference a few years back when this movie was made. 1962 had given us the INTERNS, a hokey, old-fashioned rework of DR. SOURCES with horrible plays and a cardboard script. Along came in 1971 and HOSPITALEN. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something right for a change. Seeing HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how much medical shows like ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe this enduring classic. And if HOSPITAL reminds you of NETWORK, it should. Same script.
