Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary film of the German filmmaker's extraordinary Werner Herzog, filmed for several years in the late 1960s, is one of the rare DVDs to be listened to with the comment lit. It is a visual feast of North African (mainly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply couldn't tell it was made over thirty and five years ago. The soundtrack for the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel) and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also gives its timeless quality. The story from three different German narrators (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog continues with Eisner's imports for this project, herself and film history, but the English translator's translator, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems fair, which makes it much more perfect for this project, although much of the text - in both languages ​​is quite redundant. Yes, faux-biblical sounds from the Popular Vuh Mayan creation myth in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and the Golden Time) along with quotes from a German poet Herzog names like manfred eigendorf, almost seems a satire of the first party's crooked tone ??. The film seems to be pieced together during the recording of several other Herzog projects simultaneously - the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small and the documentaries of the Land of Silence and Dark and Flying Doctors in East Africa, but these projects' rejected material only adds to the beauty of this movie, such as aerial imagery of a distant flamingo mating lake, giving an eerie creepy sensation, which Herzog wrestles with in his comment. This monstrous feeling is present right from the start of the movie to several planes landing on a desert track, with their images gradually blurrering, as the heat of the earth rises and increases the distorting waves that hit the images. That this film was influential in The Quatsi movie by Godfrey Reggio is an understatement. But while Reggio is happy to cast pictures on you, Herzog has the ability that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has: to make a completely independent vocabulary from the compilation of images and words, and one dependent on an emotional first pressure. Analyzes can fail when brought to such endeavors. Herzog often doesn't understand why his art is great. The best thing he does is quite unconsciously and mesmerically. Therefore, his contempt for the lowest common denominator of Hollywood's Hollywood is obviously on the comment. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that on the commentary Herzog tells us followed a serious drought in Cameroon. It shows the cattle carcasses, and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. Still, the viewer can sense all of this from the pictures, the sun's dark dried portions of animals and the blanched bones. Yet Herzog focuses on the stench, not a deeper meaning, even in this comment. He is pleased to let you explore and interpret what you want into and of his work, as the almost erotically feminized forms of dunes, reminiscent of a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Time of the Wolf, where Max Von Sydow runs his hand Ingrid Thulin's beautiful nude body curves. But the archetypal image in this movie, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is a mirage of a distant car that runs back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake. It is deep, hypnotic, illusive, elusive, supernatural, yet real, just like Herzog, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists is. But then it ends like everything else.
