When I first got wind of this picture, it was just called "Shepherd" and was supposed to be the movie that would put JCVD ​​back in the chances of making theatrical shtuff. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> <br /> When called "The Shepherd: Border Patrol," I was taping in excitement for this flick. With Isaac Fluorentine in the helm of steering and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination, I almost enjoyed pants in anticipation. Pictures were released by JCVD, who kicked 8 different kinds of ass as well as Scott Adkins who played it, I thought was the villain, and I was crazy about excitement. I thought it was another epic martial art situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I booked it from Blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. Reviews from vandammefan.net have changed my ideas a little, but I braced myself. The email arrived on day 4 and I tore open the package. My original plan was to rush upstairs, tear the face out of the cardboard packaging and smash the case into the right dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player. However, I stared at the case for 10 minutes and then placed the disc in my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I was cool as a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is definitely one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video movies ever, and makes Derailed look even more like toilet toilet as it is. Sure, some of the games ran a two bit card, but they were still very amazing. The shootouts were amazing, like Scott Adkins, who should have been the villain, unlike the forgetful Steven Lord. I highly recommend this flick. Seriously.
