I love absolutely promised land. The first episode I saw was while I was on my mission from 2003-2005. I really loved the rich family background exhibited in the show. Here was a family with their own battles, but instead of living on them; they would reach out with love to others who might have had the same problems in an attempt to forget about themselves and go to work. This has made me fall in love with the show. All actors; especially Gerald McRaney; had shown the true meaning of "family" that has left an indelible mark in my life. I have been on the same path they have, but it has taken a lot of time for me to develop that kind of character. I love this show so much that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really stunned when I heard it was taken out of the air. I thought and still think they should carry it back! So many lives can benefit from inspired media from heaven. I honestly think this show was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time I see only one episode. This show really (in my book) has really defined what a "Promised Land" is. It is the love that you hold in your heart for others; which brings you to a higher destination. The spirit of love is one of the most potent messages in this series, and all I can say is to bring it back. -Robert
