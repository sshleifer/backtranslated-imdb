Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses great visual graphics to show live dinosaurs. The information here is amazing. The mood of the series changes to get your attention, things like dramatic music when the fighting breaks out. There is clear evidence here for a cracking documentary! My biggest than to the authors, directors and producers and not to forget the others involved. If you stumble across this video in stores, I suggest you buy it not only for the graphics but for the extreme effort and productive work the series has to offer. 10.10
