This is a whundunnit in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark when suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is supurb as Dexter, a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his child. There is not much to suffer from this little excitement, and all pieces fit nicely together as they should. You won't be sorry you saw this if you like excitement.
