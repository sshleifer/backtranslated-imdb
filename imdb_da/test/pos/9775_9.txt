Somehow CHANGI lost in AFI awards to MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was excellent - but in my opinion not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics dismissed CHANGI as being irrelevant, insignificant, historically incorrect or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is outstanding. More than that. Brilliant. It should not be a documentary - certainly, I can forgive the actual Changi survivors (or any survivors of a POW camp) to be disappointed with the production - but for the rest of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. It contains part of the Australian culture that seems to be diminishing as times become lighter and less challenging, but we should never forget: Australians were respected worldwide after Gallipoli and World War II for their companionship and sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LATEST BULLET; The sugar factory.
