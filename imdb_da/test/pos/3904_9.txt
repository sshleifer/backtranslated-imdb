I first saw the victim (aka Out of Contention) just over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to see something that stood for Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles as her depiction as rape victim in a rape case and as the suspected murderous in the legend of the lizzie tables. Her performance in the victim like Kate, a frightened woman caught in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her is brilliant. If you like exciting thrillers than this is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end. Another great achievement worth mentioning is Eileen Heckhart, who plays the creepy and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most of Miss Montgomery's films, The Victim is not available on DVD, and I think that even though it was released on VHS some years ago, it is a rarity these days. I was lucky to have lost it when it was broadcast on TV some ten years ago and then have a good copy of this very good movie. A must see!
