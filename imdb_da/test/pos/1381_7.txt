The "7" quality is not necessarily a smudge - this film was made on a low budget - but done well within its limits. A usual pot-boiler plot - Ship with a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoners escaping in pods, landing on unknown planet, where their presence arouses something. Mayhem ensues, a lot of ammunition is exploited. <br /> <br /> The special effects were extra and properly executed, highlighting future technology with holographic displays and controls rather than relying on clear, inexpensive plastic props. Plus the movement of the story moved without allowing the viewer to fall into boredom, where they begin to pick things apart. <br /> <br /> I point this as a little Saturday afternoon flick. You can get up and beat the fridge without stopping it and it will still be fun. Even better, your girlfriend can talk all the way through without destroying your pleasure - and she'll be happy: after all, she came to TALK for you! It's that kind of movie. In any case, the actual story line has a few holes in, after they hit the planet, but hey, it's a Guns 'n' Ammo action movie. Contiguous story lines are not necessarily necessary as long as you have beer and chips at hand. Then don't get into a brain cramp at the end.
