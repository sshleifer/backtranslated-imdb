Veterinarians in World War II return home and find it difficult to adapt to civil society. This amazing drama is academically directed by Wyler and beautifully recorded by the famous film photographer Toland. Despite being close to three hours in length, it does not pull for a moment. The script of Sherwood has very human characters and great dialogue. Andrews may have his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good is Wright as a loving sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real veteran Russell as a man who lost both hands. But top honors go to March and Loy as a long married couple facing challenges while being reacquainted with each other.
