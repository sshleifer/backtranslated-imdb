Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a chick-flick. And yes, this movie is not perfect. However, the women are a smart modern update of all women's social behavior with an impressive piece of A-listers, including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film is about four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the outside of this world's female the creature responsible for most of the film's drama with the name Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to deal with her cheating husband (who has never been seen in the movie) by following the advice of both her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Apart from Mary there is Sylvie who is torn between her social life and her professional life. She has decisions to make it test her moral and ethical values. Then there is writer Alex, who is a lesbian, with a lot of spunk, but knows her way with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby along the way who loves kids and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Together, the women live for revenge, trust each other, and teach each other life. But there are cameos by Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, showing the woman's cruel and usual behavior. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is hard, silver-tongued, experienced, and yet she feels she could be what her daughter does later. There is Fisher showing how to extort and test the boundaries of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl who doesn't show mercy to what she says and who she says it to. Leachman who plays Ryan sassy housekeeper, she knows her place, when and where she needs and how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally, there is MIdler playing Leah Miller, a crazy, eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. She is the one character who gives Ryan's Mary an epiphany about who she really is discovering "what do I want." Despite Midler's stage-telling performance and memorable quotes, she was underutilized. <br /> <br /> But with the movie, the women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until you get the time when you answer the very question. It addresses feminism, what it means to be a woman (hard, reckless, bad, sticky, smart, slim, smart, shy, proud, ashame, self-conscious, careless, handsome, strong and independent); And also what women want, why are women as they are. It's fun, modern and probably not a masterpiece. But the bottom line is, it's worth the money and time to watch veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.
