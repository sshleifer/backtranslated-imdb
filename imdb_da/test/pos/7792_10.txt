I saw this movie probably more than 20 times. The witnesses are now 10-15 years old, but every time I see it, it makes me fall off my chair. Two of the finest actor Salman Khan and Aamir Khan are starring here. Although Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the better role (clever guy) in movies Salman Khan battles and sometimes performs even better as the stupid guy. All the characters are memorable. This movie is filled with fun, one-liners and fun situations (a little too silly probably). Try not to seek logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for some time. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
