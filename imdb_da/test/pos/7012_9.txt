Hi all lovely Dirty Dancing fans !!!! I came across this bulletin board when I was bored one day and thought it was cool. I absolutely love DD! I saw the first thing in my friend's house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and got hooked !! I saw it there at least 10 times and soon I bought the DVD for myself. At this point I have remembered most of the script and can recite it when someone asks me about it. "I carried a watermelon?" '' It's been so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone !! Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I don't care what they think about it, I know it's brilliant! I read the comments earlier and I have a few questions for you very much. 1. Why do you ask trivial issues such as Lisa and Baby? I don't think it matters so much. They are teens in the 60's, isn't it enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition that you are talking about? It sounds very interesting ... Please reply to this. I'd like to see other fans' opinions ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
