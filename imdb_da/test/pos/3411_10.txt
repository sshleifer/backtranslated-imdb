Several weeks ago, I lost my beloved companion and friend for fourteen years, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home from the animal hospital alone, after making one of the most painful decisions in my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I could be wrong, but I remember a line that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan tried to trick him into hell, but his dog couldn't go with him. . .and his dog, on the other hand, was cruel over the gatekeeper who tried to trick the old hunter into "entering". . that it would be "a helluva of heaven whose dogs were not allowed", and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (of what they had believed was heaven, alone walked eternity.) What a foolish moment when they meet a "good ole country child" on the eternal road to discover only that he is an angel sent out to find them, and "safe neighbor, of course, dogs are allowed in the sky." <br /> <br /> I admit that I was crying when I talked about this with my daughter while grieving over the consumption of our beloved gold. Rod Serling really was a genius, a voice that at the beginning of the sixties spoke against racism, hatred, "know-nothingism" and was a deep inspiration for me to become an author. This episode, over twenty-five years, brought a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a loved one. I encourage you to get a copy the next time there is one of the Twilight Zone marathons or buy it. There will be some tears, but also comfort. As always, thank you Rod for everything you taught us. . Even now.
