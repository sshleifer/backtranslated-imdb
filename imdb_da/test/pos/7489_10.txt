One good thing: This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from the beginning to the end. An example of low-budget film production by the best writer / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he could find (eg: Lamborghini, supermodel, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all his camera settings . <br /> <br /> Another good thing: This movie seems to be made for the DVD era, with several segments that include a larger story (similar to Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's Desperado's work). Each "chapter" of the film features Thomas Jane's protagonist who spends a day at home meeting fast and memorable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and an unforgettable role of Paulina Porizkova. Even another good thing: Not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable ... Every person watching this movie remembers an important scene. Much like the release will always be remembered because it is terrible rape by Ned Beatty, Thursday will go down like the movie where a woman rape rape an unwilling man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> One bad thing: The title makes people believe that it is somehow related to (or derived from) the "Friday" series of ice cube movies. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
