Knowledge is a typical British comedy for the period. For someone who is not familiar with the process of becoming a London cabby, the film has to seem very average with a few laughs from a couple of old faces. Knowledge, however, comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife who know what these poor people are going through. And find yourself comparing your events with the characters.
