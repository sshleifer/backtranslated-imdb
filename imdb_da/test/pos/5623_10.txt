Let's see, many of the bad movies are made all the time. For those people who work in movies, you probably have spent a lot of time and effort in many of these plot minor wonders. Sometimes, and that's my opinion, it's just to make the movie that is important to us. To tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). The collaboration process is also a key feature that is unique to film and theater. In order to produce some caliber, the talents of a variety of people, depending on the scale, require bringing their story to life. However, the most exciting part of American Movie is not the film being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself as a character of his own life, which requires our attention. None of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with. But I would argue that they are archetypes of small parts of us that try to be part of this cult activity of independent filmmaking. (Alright a very small part of us) These are the people who live under their own life's rocks and just as random is the snare of romance in the cinema. This leads me to my next argument. American Movie captures the raw spirit in independent filmmaking. Bad stories told about (today) digital movies with sloppy effects and horrible beliefs - because this is the best thing they can do with a budget of a few thousand dollars instead of a multi-million dollar budget a day. This is the difference between low low LOW end productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker will just make a linear or even nonlinear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he invests in himself and the resources around him to see a finished product on his rundown TV. Robust individualism materializes in every art form. I find this movie to be a brilliant truth document for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of myself. Man, these people are funny. Their problems seem funny, their properties are fun. Best line in the movie: "It's okay! .. It's okay! ... There's something to live for! .. Jesus told me that!" Said a million times by a fun old man. Hat is off to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
