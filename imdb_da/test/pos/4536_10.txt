This is one of my favorite comedy films. Chris Farley is fun as the unlucky victim of fun, and David Spade is perfect for playing straight-man to Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene where the two are in the car, song for Superstar by The Carpenters is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great cartoonist with great potential - unfortunately he will be missed. /> <br />
