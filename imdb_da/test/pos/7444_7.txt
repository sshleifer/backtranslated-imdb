Some great SPOILERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival and I have to admit that it was really a fan, it was really IMPRESSIVE. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on ... BUT there is one guy. EVERY movie was thought exclusively for the players who loved it, and so can enjoy every reference, character, interior joke (you should see a joke about winning music that is special cartoon), etc. A poor man not within for the world of FF will of course see the amazing technical part, but CAN NOT understand the inner satisfaction of seeing, eg. The barret looks and shoots Bahamut right out of now. He asks himself, "WHERE IS THIS GUY?" And I can't blame him. He can't even understand what a gamer feels like when in the opening season the game opens music, Nanaki runs in the canyon with his two kids, howling in Midgar's ruins and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all characters have made a look or quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno & Rude were really goofy and comical to see, but the final impression that the movie left me was "hardcore gamers' last dream, but far less for a MOVIE fan ... ".
