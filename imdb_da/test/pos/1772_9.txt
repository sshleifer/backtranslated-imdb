Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate ............... but by golly Miss Jean Peters has fun trying - and this shows especially during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr. Thomas Gomez - extremely upbeat) when the sheer joy of performing is evident on her face. With fifty years of oversight, feminists seem to address this movie as a kind of anthem for empowerment of women in a male-dominated society, but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had such a concept in their minds the time. It was an exciting, entertaining family movie with absolutely no pretensions, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. It was fun. M.Louis Jourdan is both immense and treacherous as her love interest. Sir. Herbert Chapman is clever and philosophical as the wise and philosophical physician. Mrs. James Robertson Justice is just a bit incredible as a bosun. But it is Miss Peters who stays in memory. Unfortunately, young, illiterate, hard but vulnerable, wonderfully agile and ultimately brave, she is everyone's idea of ​​a lady pirate. There was a clear window for her in feisty costume roles - that she didn't choose to grab it, is a matter of some regret.
