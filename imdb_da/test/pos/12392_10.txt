François Truffaut, Young Jerk from "Cahiers du Cinema", the main bastion of the upcoming so-called New Wave, made a big show to hate this movie and even accused it of drawing French cinema into mediocrity. Translation: Truffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already envious of how Carné could make a great success of a story that pushed all the right buttons from the audience and actually involved it in something important with all sense and seduction of sensuality. In other words, where the public and many critics experienced a perceptive sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful movie, then Truffaut "Girls on the Loose". After all, Carné had everything that would be seriously defective from New Wave: intelligence, sophistication, humor, a great talent as a storyteller, a great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical splendor, the ability to make his actors do what he wanted Have them do and a good dose of good taste. For comparison, Truffaut is a provincial drilling with nothing to say. <br /> <br /> A 50's tragic remake of "Pride and Prejudice", the French response to "Rebel Without a Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells a story of unrestrained Parisian youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespectful respect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics perceived Carné cases on the subject as the moralizing slope of an "older person" while I think what happened, on the contrary, is that Carné is gay and knows one or two things about oppression, felt countless sympathy for the young iconoclasts in their history. Moreover, this is a French film, there is no mistake that the rebellion is substantially sexual, something that still needs to be decoded in American films such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One". <br /> <Carne's young people are all extremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They run the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of their suits, dresses and duffle coats was a highlight of the fashion dog of the last century. Their haircut is still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. Their body shape, as they reached and maintained without effort, is still the modern western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. They know how to move, how to be sexy and how to love ?? even though the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined by and live by the code and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice versa. The events depicted in this film have long had long tongues in France on amoralism and nihilism in youth, while still making it a great public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stylish and beautiful, I suppose the older viewers saw that they could wish they could be like the people depicted in the movie, and a lot of young filmmakers or Hopeful filmmakers like Truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice, reflecting how they would never like to make a movie as sexy or popular as this, although they would be very good at ultimately aiming at the nihilistic bits. On the other hand, considering a particular clichéd aspect of the manuscript (amorous misconception leading to a medical emergency), one can only wonder about the terribly pious and puritanic mishmash Americans would have drawn from the same basic script if they had dared to tackle topic. Interestingly, the film was filmed at the same basic places as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored its tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
