This is a beautiful but simple movie about a man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need, but has structured his entire life around. It's heartbreaking, it's funny, it's brilliant, it's annoying, it's delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius. <br /> <br /> I've read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the movie adaptation) and I was just enraptured by the characters. I laughed more than once. And every time someone talks about what it is about, I hear the same chopped answer, almost as if it were a big word: "Just look forward to having come to know that you love life. " Yet this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. The call about the ring and "in case." It really gets a thinking. Suddenly, this story goes from a simple search for an inner metamorphosis, and I find myself looking at things a little different now. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting this before, ever, reading it because the book had many obscene, fair perverted stories that were not included in the movie, primarily the story of Jonathan's family that was not necessary for the movie. <br /> <br /> A little trivia I heard is that Wood's current boyfriend has a cameo in this flick as a drummer in the band Alex arranges to perform as Jonathan steps off the train to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half of the movie and try to figure out what it's all about, exactly, and what Jonathan is all about, because his character is then pulled back like a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> It's great, and in my opinion one of Elijah Wood's best movies.
