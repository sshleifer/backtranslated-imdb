I recently saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2007. The title of the movie and indeed much of the movie's outline is from Robert Graves poem Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk leads a play by Petr Jrchovský from a story of Hrebejk and Jrchovský. History begins in 2002 when Prague is hit by one of the devastating 100-year floods that destroy Marcela's household (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children Cuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova). Because of the moldy conditions in which they now live Cuba's asthma are life-threatening. Marcela works and Jarda runs a chopping shop out of the garage they live next door. Jarda's shadowy occupation runs him off the law, and one of his theft is horrified by Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who shares his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to care for Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is Marcella's mother who lives with her regular husband, Uncle Richie, who Jirí Schmitzer plays in probably the best role of the film. Rounding off this excellent cast is Emília Vasaryova as Jada's mentally fragile mother, giving money to the local religious charlatan. There is a lot going on here for a small movie, and it is a good story with a good script and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina provides the music track with additional music from Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There is a lot to like about this movie and I will give it a 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
