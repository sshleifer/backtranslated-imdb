This program was quite interesting. The way the program was shown made it even more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to. All three hours in my opinion it was worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas the physicists gave. Extra dimensions really boggle the mind. If you have the chance, see this amazing documentary.
