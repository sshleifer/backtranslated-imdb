This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battalions were created because of the increasing demand for soldiers when the Soviet Union suffered major losses throughout the war. These battalions consisted of prisoners and dishonest soldiers who were given the opportunity to clear their names by proving themselves in battle. They were looked down as foam and were easily exploited during battle without much regret or much honor from the military side. They were often sent on suicide missions and hit extreme losses. Those who refused to fight were executed on sight. Needless to say, their lives sucked. <br /> <br /> There were some very nice performances of the cast, especially by Yuri Stepanov, who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov, who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov, who played Major Kharchenko. But the series is not really so addictive, partly because it is too long, it can have much shorter and so effective. <br /> <br /> Although it's about war, Shtrafbat has very mild violence and virtually no Gore. It only relies on the actors to make it work, and that's a television series, so the producers didn't want to scare the viewers and the sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime and explains why so many men chose to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I would rather be a fascist when a communist gave the conditions presented in the film. A sign explains that the Soviets beat their farm clean and his family died of hunger. Out of anger he burned it down, which arrested him for destroying Kolhoz's property and he ended up in the criminal conviction as a criminal. Antip reminisced on how his mother killed his youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their homeland, rather than for the Soviets. <br /> <br /> The Penal Battalion had a Naval Infantry who raped a girl, killed his buddy in the process, threatened his second mate to keep his mouth shut about both trials, and then celebrated injuries when it was to fight. On top of all, the girl committed suicide because of shame. I imagine if enough Marines saw this movie, they would pick up banners and riots on the streets that require a boycott or an official excuse from the producers. <br /> <br /> At least I would recommend it to anyone with the least interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I wasted 500+ minutes in my life.
