Loved this movie !! Great acting by Carla Gugino. Interesting story of a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (not all of them?). Some surprising twists in the movie and the plot were easy to follow without being so horrified as being completely incomprehensible. It was a completely unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies are trying to be.
