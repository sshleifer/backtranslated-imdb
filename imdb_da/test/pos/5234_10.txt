I had never expected such an old movie to be as impressive as this 1930's turned out to be. The scenes from the pioneers, moving west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and any kind of trial and danger, are astonishing in their robust credibility. Much of the movie was shot outdoors and the movie has a really epic feel about it. The actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did, and the results are amazing. The carts, the clothes, every detail looks and feels right. The characters are simple but trustworthy, with a fair story moving like the lorry to the destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles as the mirror drives the carts and does a fine job as the idealistic young front man. He is up against a wonderful scurvy trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a licking gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, Senior, like the coarse, bear-like stairs. The beard of power, snarling, greater than the depiction of life is both comical and threatening. I hold pictures of him with a bandana, gold ring earrings and black eyelash, with a parrot on the shoulder as he grunts and germinates various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is lovely as a wily old frontman who is Wayne's best friend. The delightful Marguerite Churchill makes a spiritual heroine whose original encounter with Wayne is a hilarious blend, resulting in a long-running quarrel consisting of insults and mistaken indifference on her part not to show persistence on his side. The results are quite humorous, and you are happy to see them eventually come together at the end. The landscape is stunning, with the carriages crossing true prairies and being lowered by ropes down rocks. Native Americans who are clearly the real article and not white makeup actors act as both friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends who taught him everything he knows about survival in the desert. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a straightforward story told by a talented cast and crew. It will probably seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a silent dignity about what never lets it be corny. There is a great intentional humor, including a rowdy rage of a pioneer making loud animals sound hiding every time the smooth gambler Ian Keith tries to connect the beautiful heroine to marry him. His thriving talk of the plantation he allegedly owns is interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and stifling ducks, causing it to be the seducer to look in irritation for the invisible creatures. Recommended for both Western fans and lovers of old films in general. This is really a classic movie of all ages.
