The hallmark "let's get ready for summer movies." It's stupid, stupid and maybe a door dated, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as I did when I first saw it. Like all "little boys versus creation" movies, so yes, it's very predictable, but it's hot and fun. And no, it's not Bill Murray on his Bill Murrayest, but he starts stretching out into what was his first major role. But strange to see how few of the "fresh young faces" in this movie continued to do much more.
