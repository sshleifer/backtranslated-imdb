David Lynch's ninth full-length feature film, Mulholland Drive, is a deeply moving story of fraud and jealousy. If that is something, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Each frame of this movie has meaning and links to other parts and to itself at the same time. Nothing is what the first one seems to be, and you're back with a real puzzle game as you end up trying to put the pieces together. It is a film that does not compromise and it also fails to handle the challenging form and camera language, as might be the case with Lost Highway. Even though classic lynchian motifs and devices are clearly recognized, the film remains very original, even in the light of being a Lynch movie. Lost Highway marked a new way of telling a story; bred an unconventional means of putting emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive not only Lynche managed to manage this technique, but takes it to new levels, making it much more complex and multidimensional. In doing so, he creates a framework of different layers in time and in the human mind. At a press conference on the Cannes Film Festival in 2001, David Lynch said that the efforts at perfection could at best give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about synergies like this becomes very relevant to Mulholland Dr., where the various sequences and many details contribute to the total number; Dreamscapes and parallels are confused with creating the story. In some art, beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds worlds Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. It is never forced which, in my opinion, for example, Memento does, using an original way of communicating with viewers. Further, Mulholland Drive compares to other movies, I think it shows David Lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and filmmaking in a way no one has ever done. Compared to, for example, Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney, I think Lynch is doing better not to let the artist dominate the film maker or more likely that David Lynch better understands and performs filmmaking as an art form. Understanding the plot is not a small thing, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. The Lynchian cinema is often, and definitely in Mulholland Drive, a wave of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it: "A little too much, and the feeling goes away. A little too little, and it doesn't." In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this balance. Lynch's portraits span all sorts of dimensions and take different directions and create incredibly realistic characters and situations. Looking at Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a true and nude film with undoubtedly artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what has it taken to the top of the cinema history. The ultimate movie.
