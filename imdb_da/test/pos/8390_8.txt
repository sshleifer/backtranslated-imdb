It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I didn't expect to like this movie. I was disappointed with both the Kill Bill movies (though I preferred the other) and Death Proof (though it was better in the shorter double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction, and believe that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature film-making - technically his most superior - including the last major achievement brought on by Robert De Niro. Since then, it seems to me, while his film has been okay (I haven't hated them), he has drawn water in referential, reverent, self-forgetting juvenilia. <br /> <br /> So I read the manuscript last year to Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Sure it had some typical QT blooms and the opening scene was unimaginably strong. There were a few good signs. But on the side it was more youthful waste that was largely destroyed by the uninteresting base of the title. It made me seriously consider not watching the movie. The trailers didn't do anything to convince me. I only changed my mind when I got the opportunity to watch the film with a Tarantino Q & A trainer in London. I figured it would be worth keeping him in Q&A, as I know from interviews how entertaining he can be personally. <br /> <br /> So little was I prepared for the sheer overwhelming fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds. <Just Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes the references are there, but they do not disturb the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting, but he works fine, with a little to do, but looks aggressive and does nothing to hurt the movie as I had feared. While I admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof to magnify the great stunt scene's excitement, her inability to act in a key role was a problem for the movie. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's dawn to dawn, as Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really makes this work is how big it is. Spaghetti-Western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderful over the top without falling too far into the comic quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so great. Courtesy so great. Brad Pitt is so great! In the trailers Hitler's moment hit Pitts performance me, but in connection with the movie they are funny. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifunes blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course an appropriate Lee Marvin edge. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (whom I didn't know before) and Melanie Laurent (whom I first noticed in a brilliant French-English British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and I expect to see both spend much more in the future . Tarantino has obviously not lost his eye to casting, which seemed to leave him in Death Proof. Waltz is just as great in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is the appropriate cardinal innocence, but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here. <br /> <br /> Every member of the cast makes it fun to be heard from what they do while not indulging in just having fun and trying to make fun, tremendously. It laughs - and there are plenty - coming organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping flashes and pushing it too far, but his scene is ruled in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender, who seems to be pulled directly from formenborough's Great Escape leader. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful blooms, but those who work with history. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a rebellion. After a sensational, slow-burning opening and a brilliant intro to the inquisitive Basterds, the pace never leaves more than two and a half hours flying past. It also looks beautiful and marks this as a return to true film-making rather than just self-releasing silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired by Morricone on. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome and hilarious. After a summer where almost all movies have disappointed me, it came as a great surprise that the right fun and entertaining, but also engaging and impressive movies should be this, since I would never have believed it from scripting. Welcome back QT.
