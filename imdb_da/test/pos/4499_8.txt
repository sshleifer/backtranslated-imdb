Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and the struggle for redemption. Seen in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of the Taliban regime, all the elements are present for great drama, but under Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) direction, the film lacks the kind of hurtful emotional impact it gives a memorable experience even Whether it is entertaining, well-behaved and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> Seen in 1978 in Kabul, but filmed in Kashgar, China because of the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens film between two young boys is very real, even though they are miles apart in social and economic situations. The 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in a good environment with his wealthy and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his wealth seems a little unnoticed in one of the world's poorest countries. Although Baba is a loving father, he admits Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business associate, that Amir is too soft and that there is "something missing with that boy". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who dopes on his every need and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. The two are separated not only in class but also by ethnicity. Amir, a budding author, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Although we learn a little about their traditions or social situation, they are bound by their love for kite flying, a popular sport in Kabul and Amir's reading of Afghan people to Hassan, who is illiterate. The annual kite-flying competition for the boys is a big event in their lives and the CGI effects are breathtaking. The kite cords are covered with glass particles, and the winner is the one whose kite string can cut down the other dragons in the sky. Hassan is the kite runner who has a ghastly ability to find the fallen kites and bring them to Amir as a trophy. However, after Amir wins the important competition, a sad event arises that will shape the rest of his life. Bullies led by Elder Assef (Elham Ehsas), later appearing as a ruthless Taliban leader, attacking Hassan because he is a Hazara and brutal rape him (without camera) while Amir is too scared to try to prevent it. Unable to confront his perceived lack of courage (although one may wonder if anything he could have done to help Hassan), the debt becomes the driving force in his relationship with Hassan, and their friendship becomes strained. In one incident, Amir throws pomegranate at Hassan as if he is asking him to fight back and punish him for his inaction, but Hassan does not bait and continues to be loyal despite his friend's cowardice. When Amir calls on his father to dismiss the servants and accuse Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits theft even though he is innocent. Eventually, the circumstances force Ali and Hassan to leave. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave refugees to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story picks up years later. Baba is forced to work at a gas station and to sell trinkets in an open market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) apparently goes through life's movements, studying to become a local college writer. After he falls in love and marries Soraya (Atossa Leoni), a Kabul generals daughter, Amir finally publishes his first novel, A Season of Ace, and things look very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan asking him to visit him in Pakistan, he says "there is a way to be good again", the specter that has haunted him all his life, Amir speaks to go home . He returns to Pakistan and returns with great risk to a Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to confront the demons of his past and to discover an exciting secret in the process. <br /> <br /> Kite Runner is a sensitive movie dealing with the inner pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allowing you to go beyond shame to a new one level of responsibility. Nor does it hide the pain caused by Afghanistan by wars and revolution, a pain that may be represented by Hassan's suffering. Unfortunately, the complex situations reduce to the level of good guys and villains and distort what actually happened as the United States was liberated, engaging in anti-government hidden operations within the country, from any responsibility for the disastrous war that left a million dead and millions more disabled. Although inspired by the excellent children's actors and moved by the freedom that kitesurfing represents, Kite Runner relinquishes his power as it attempts to replace the melodrama of history.
