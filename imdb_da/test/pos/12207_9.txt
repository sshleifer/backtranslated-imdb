The surface, from the day when the teaser first appeared in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On the one hand, it seemed so high concept and plot driven that it seemed to the passenger that it would work better as a movie picture (or more). Plus it meant that it was NBC's attempt at a "Lost Killer". On the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of Lost seemed to be fascinated. So after a (and possibly only) season at NBC, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault of Sci-fi or fill a gap in NBC's lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or above. Its reviews were some of the better ones on the network (which doesn't say much) but the show is taken out of the air without any real official announcement of its future. So is it worthwhile? Yes. <br /> <br /> The surface follows a continuing history format, driven by plot alongside no filler episodes. Almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, like a movie picture. No filler episodes that have a pain on your side when you missed an episode. Nevertheless, the show's double contributed to it; Big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie, you end every episode feeling a little happened and you're back, want more! However, the feature of the show shows how great it is. The casting is solid; The three main lines, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, put a solid performance on each episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding / studying the creatures. The support casting, including Ian Anthony Dale and the short execution of Rade Serbedzija, fills the casting well. The story is slow to start (my sorry, it doesn't really take up to 3-4 episodes in the short 15-episode season), but the last half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are amazing (your jaw falls when you see an overview of one of the creators 'attacks' a ship). Many of the show's problems can be remedied by buying the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> In short, if you've missed the first season and you're curious, go back and see it. There are no Twin Peaks in the form of quirkiness, but the high concept character puts in the league with it, Lost and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. Enjoy it.
