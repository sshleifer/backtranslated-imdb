One of the movies I came across through the Criterion Collection and, as usual, spoiled as a change of pace. It turned out to be a great decision. I was almost fascinated by the quality of the movie, the story it was told and the way it was told. The almost minimalistic feeling of the movie with sparse dialogue and almost constant music has just added a totally evocative level to the film. This is really a great movie to spend some time with and enjoy.
