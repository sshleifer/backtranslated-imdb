This movie is one of my favorite comedies from time to time. The dialogue is sharp, the pace is fast. This is not just a smart comedy, it's an interesting look at what's going on behind the scenes in the TV news industry. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun lines ... a few of my favorites: <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastic) It must be nice to always believe you know better that you always think you are the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) No, it's not, it's terrible !! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must look good Jane: How do you know? Aaron: No one invites a badly serious idiot to their room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully fun Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the newsroom staff runs to beat a deadline. There are so many fun scenes that it's hard to choose a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
