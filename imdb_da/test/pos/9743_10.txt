As previously mentioned in one of my major reviews, the Universal Pictures'Trilogy of FLASH GORDON should not be classified with the other series. Indeed, for the three of these, a kind of celluloid-electronic mythology has been made into a tightly-warped mid-twentieth-century world. They stand alone in the minds of many people as an example of what a cliffhanger was. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest at NBC's late evening talk show, TOMORROW, hosted by Tom Snyder. This was around 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe asked about his personal fitness habits. He credited weight training and swimming with some healthy eating habits - which included vitamin and protein supplements. (And would you believe he smoked more cigarettes!) When questioned about his career, Mr. Of course, Snyder was the subject of his depiction (and strong identification with) the character of Flash. Buster said he had read and enjoyed the feature in his original medium, which is a cartoon belonging to Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He said he had thought it wouldn't work when it was transferred to the screen! Luckily he was wrong. <br /> <br /> With regard to the first series, it was a very good adaptation of the original continuity from Sunday Color Comics. The world is coming to an end due to impending collision with Planet Mongo. It is up to independent work Dr. Zarkov to rock to the wild planet to change his course. He listens to the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, well-known paratroopers from the airline landing in Zarkov's estate. The serial has excitement and manages to make one feel that there is always another danger lurking just outside the film frame. Costuming and decor are varied, from Romanesque to Oriental to Art Decco. It would be easy to convince that this was due to fertility from Universal, but once again it was faith in the creator, comic film Alex Raymond's visual concepts. (Just look at the old strips that are reprinted in many collections). used before in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a science fiction musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by Universal's prop dept., There is the best Hollywood company that makes Scream and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The well-known features of Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) coming into a good girl vs. bad girl fight over flash. Charles Middleton portrays Emperor Ming in a sort of overly melodramatic villain, but makes it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is toned down from the sheer madness he suffered in his newsprint appearance. (By the way, ever wondering how Zar-KOV has a brogue?) Richard Alexander makes a fine, heavily built Prince Barin, ever helpful and so noble. Comic actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the surprise of the casting, stealing the scene after the scene as a lecherous, Henry VIII as the scoundrel became ally, King Vultan, ruler of Hawkmen. Among the others, Jim Pierce is best known as Prince Thun from Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, had also portrayed Tarzan in a movie - but he later married Tarzan Creator, daughter of Edgar Rice Bourrough, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and the two successors, FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS UNIVERSE (1940), have been a rigid juvenile fare for generations, first in the movie then housed in television release . As good wine they are seen to be better with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr. Crabbe was wrong.
