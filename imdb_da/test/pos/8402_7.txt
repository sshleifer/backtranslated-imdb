I'm a great Gone With the Wind fan and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and loved it. This is a successor of sorts. Just as you didn't expect it with the "Frankly dear, I don't give a shame" end. Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though no one will ever replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could give Vivien Leigh a run for her money (though I'm almost guilty of saying that.) Her attitude and presence in the movie fit the character of a tee so you love and hate her at the same time which is how most people also think of Mrs Leigh's portrayal. The film moves slowly, mostly because it follows the book so closely and was not released as a feature film. Excellent choice on the manufacturer's side. I think this movie deserves some recognition for the great story, the revival of characters that had gone for nearly 50 years, and something that even Margaret Mitchell herself could have been proud of.
