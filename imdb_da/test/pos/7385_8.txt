Rickman is sexy and good, but "alien" is less convincing - Reedus is kind of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - it could be the director's fault in this case - we should find him close at the very end just because he is "beautiful "- but that's not enough. The forbidden wife is almost convincing - 7 years of marriage and she and Rickman's character should be more determined with each other whether their roles should be incompatible or not - they must have patterns now. I understand it, though I think the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and not convincingly attracted to "strangers" - so it is a failure - the unspoken link between the Rickman character and "stranger" is better done, though We are not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips into it and out of the American pattern). disappointing but with some great actors.
