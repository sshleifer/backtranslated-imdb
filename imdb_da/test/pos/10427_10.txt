This should be one of the best movies we've seen, and we highly recommend it for its exposure to the injustice of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly amazing as Corby / White Wolf. But felt the story would be improved if his character had multiple scenes. This is a movie that can be seen over and over without tiring.
