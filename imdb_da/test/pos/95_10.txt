Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian movie. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references and then this movie is likely to be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal and it is lovingly told by the author Roch Carrier. It's a hilarious story I've known for quite a while, and I was recently lucky enough to see it again, so I just had to write a warm recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece and a must-see if you are Canadian.
