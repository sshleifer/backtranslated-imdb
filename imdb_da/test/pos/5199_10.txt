This movie makes for infantry what Das Boot did for Submariners. If you appreciate Das Boot then it's all you really need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well done piece of cinema. Equal to Das Boot. Basically, it follows a company of the elite German "Stormtrooper" infantry leaving the garrison service in an idyllic Italian seaside resort and immediately pressed into the chaos of the disintegrating Russian front. <br /> <br /> A good war film sheds light on both the senselessness and brutality of warfare, and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight. This movie does it. The film is full of drama and action, and it is also entertaining at this level.
