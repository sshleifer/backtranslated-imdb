For comedy to work, there are many factors involved: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't be afraid to take risks. 2. If anyone or something deserves to be poked fun, do it and continue with it, <br /> <br /> ... but most of all: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUNNY !! !! <br /> <br /> "All of these three things succeed in Chaser's War on Everything. In fact, it turned out that the show was so popular and so fun that only a month after the first episode, a DVD from the first season was released. I picked it up within a few days after it was released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu # @ ing tears in my eyes - it's so good, good! In short and to save me blabbing about the show - watch it, buy it, podcast it, whatever makes you see the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go CHASER !!!!
