How I spend my vacation closes the TV series, which aired from 1990 to 1992. I have always enjoyed the series for what it is. I've never compared the series to the old Looney Tunes. The video release was divided into four or five episodes (I can't remember writing this) on television, and it's included in the episode's series of the series. What is good about this series is that All the main characters in the show have a major role in history. We see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with his parents in a Safari, Plucky and Hampton, crossing the country with Hampton's parents, Fifi is in a beach, etc. The Climax is very good, and eventually all Tiny Toon signs recover to the start of a new year in "Looniversity", thus virtually ending the good run on this TV show.
