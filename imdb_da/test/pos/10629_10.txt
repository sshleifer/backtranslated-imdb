At the end of my review of Cache I wrote that I was fascinated with Haneke as a film producer. That's what led me to get DVD to La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about half an hour ago. It has all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the horrendously twisted pathology that would "create" an individual like Huppert's Erika, still trying years and years to please her mother at the expense of everyone and everything otherwise in his life, beginning with himself. She has suppressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed slavery, including, of course, her sexuality, which literally has implanted to the point of madness, to where she can no longer begin to understand what a true loving impulse would feel like. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of a serious emotional cripple that has never found the strength to get out of its infancy and become a working adult. I think this topic concerns us all - we all strive for autonomy, but there is a need for so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even at the conscious level. It is also excellent with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually and the reality of these fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another person. Huppert's character gets what she asks for during the movie, and it's hardly the emancipating experience she'd imagined. <br /> <br /> Regarding the much discussed scene in the bathroom: I really understood how this sequence had all sorts of erotic charges (for the viewer I think) sucked it out because of the previous scene where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. At that time, she has already discovered that she is dangerously disturbed, and then it's not a trip, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting pigeons. I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how halfway through it I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I read subtitles. It has never happened before in any foreign film, and I have seen a few. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like Cache, the end is not all wrapped up in a nice little clearing arc, but unlike Cache, at least we get some sense of finality, even though we don't do it ourselves surely know if Huppert's character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste when it comes to Michael Haneke, I needless to say more than a trifle that is fascinated.
