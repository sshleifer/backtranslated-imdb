Fantastically written, acted and produced! Loved seeing this shiny, talented cast - every one of them - giving such a great performance. This movie thoroughly warmed the hearts of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for Black History month. Full of a precise depiction of recent history and very accurate characters that weathered incredible pain - with dignity and faith in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that will eventually burn the talent of his adulthood. Next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child, remember; show or he can be a writer-in-the-making!
