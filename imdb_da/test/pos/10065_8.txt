If this movie was made in the 50s or 60s, both critics and fans would have praised it. I even enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is not a timeless piece, and it has not aged well over the years, but it is fun to see, anyway. As for Mrs Ritchie's performance in the film? Not the best on the planet - but it adds to the movie's unique slapstick comedy aspirations, showing Madonna's (often undervalued) sense of comic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former judge framed for a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unhappy future groom / doll sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occur, creating the plot. (And there * is one, people!) Give the movie a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised at how fun it really is.
