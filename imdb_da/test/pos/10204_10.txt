Long makes the sharks and gardens in the first part of this extraordinary western, before settling in typical deterministic, dark and guilty Lang for the finals. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that show its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtle. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and persecuted, we do not know why - he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse but discovers that Creighton is in a bad way, decides to repair him first. This is mainly promoted through facial expressions and very short, cut dialogue - for 2 minutes we know that Shaw is a crime, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton move toward civilization, then disappears. <br /> <br /> Cut a few weeks or months later, with Creighton at Mend and responsible for an expedition to lay telegraphy wire west of Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout trying to leave when he finds out that Creighton is responsible; But Creighton still wants him to repay a debt and feel some quality. Also employed is a budfoot, son of a charity for the project, but atypically, Austrian Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent as he immediately shows in a fun but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both rents strike Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - again, not typically - seems right to be able to look after herself as any man. The comradeship between the three men, the comic elements involving an unwilling cook and various panes and thumbs, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the movie and reminds me of more of the Howard Hawks' Red River or 'Only' Angels have wings "than most Lang - but they play so well and the action progresses so naturally that it does not matter, and does not change our joy - if it might change our expectations - like the more common Langian themes of the haunted past Dark secrets and the enormous traits of the lighter, destructive and evil ways will dominate the later part of the movie, Shaw's old friends come back to haunt him as the lorry and its wires move west; Shaw must fight with whatever he wants to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), the leader of the Forbidden. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cushioned in early Technicolor and moving pretty smoothly from sound steps to western locations, this is for my money easily along the best western and one of his very best movies, which as powerful as any of his films conveys men's tragic inability to Escape their past and build a new future. Scott is as good as I have seen him and shows more with a glance at the eye than many actors can do in a piece of dialogue, and the rest of the casting is uniformly fine. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's former criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even to a long-standing long-devotee like myself; And even in 1941 it seems that there was no place more full of meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can get shaving, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really be one as long as the old bands are still holding you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
