Have lived really well - still exciting and exciting today. Definitely one of Hitch's best movies. Beautifully shot, with a great precondition for excitement, sex appeal from beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise, you want to see it to the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as Master of Suspense, I recommend this lovely little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
