I liked this movie. Nobody likes it, but I do. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it as much as the first one, but it was still good. The script and plot may not have changed, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had Jackie Mason's part. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another mistake in the movie I didn't hate so much was Dan Akroyd. The film was made 8 years after the first. Bill Murray, "Carl," could have interrupted his work as an assistant farmer and joined the military, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought of it, it could also have made the film better. <br /> <br /> This was my comment on Caddyshack II. I give it 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but good anyway. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Caddyshack 1 and are discussing whether or not you want to see Caddyshack 2, I say give it a try.
