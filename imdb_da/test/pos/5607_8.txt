One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a "bad" one.) Although it may be a little more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect. Nevertheless, it still claims that Hartley slopes as we are all used to. <br /> <br /> First image Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes, and regrets the impending end of civilization. Now imagine the whole conversation going on over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar. And as an extra conversation (not to mention visual) distraction, let's throw in PJ Harvey as the hungry companion (aka Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Next, just for fun, in the background, an ever-present Salvation Army Band (played by Yo La Tengo) to serve as an added diversion. The road to moral reasoning has never been so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Maybe more questions than answers, but it's fun. And Mr. Donovan is subdued, as always.
