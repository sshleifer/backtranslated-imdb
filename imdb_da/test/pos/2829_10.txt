And that says a lot. Rent this if you want to be staggered by inequality, blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts, direction and casting in the history of the movie. I'm staggered. I can't believe I saw it. I'm a big Bernadette Peter's fan, usually - but it tested my decision. Don't read more reviews here, it's best if you don't know anything about the plot. Just rent it. You won't believe what you see .......
