Having grown up in New Jersey and spent many day and night on the giant streets of New York in the 1970s, one sees a movie such as "The Seven-Ups" or his relative spirit, "The French Connection", always reminds one of a time and a place that for some might be NYC's darkest hour, but which in my early twenties was always a fun adventure after another. I really miss the times. As a reviewer noted, "This movie is quite appropriate enough to capture the strong, cold and material sense of the NYC winter season, while underlying the subsoil of the area's infamous underworld of crime and police. A good snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. "A spot-on characterization of both the film and the city. The stellar features of this movie - the plot, cast, the characters and of course the billiard - are amply described in many of the reviews here, so I will not go into it except to say that one of My favorite moments arises during the car race when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch riding shotgun for maniacal Bill Hickman. The look of horror on Richard Lynch's face along with the defensive gestures is so characteristic of an actor who is much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to see. I get a chuckle out of it every time.
