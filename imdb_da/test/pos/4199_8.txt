After winning a championship match, the boxer celebrates John Garfield (like Johnnie Bradfield) with a drinking suit that leads to the killing of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr Garfield is due. When the leader dies in a car accident, Garfield's stolen watch, the authorities believe the boxer is dead. Yet another WANTED man changes Garfield's identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (like Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as angel), Leo Gorcey (like Spit), Huntz Hall (like Dippy), Gabriel Dell (like TB) and Bernard Punsly as slim) . <br /> <br /> Garfield bonds with the young "Dead End" comrades sent to stay with sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to reforming the school, thanks to his brother deceased priest "Far Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to watch the kids. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him ?? <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids" make beautiful (Max Steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in great shape. Garfield and "Dead End" children are a winning combination; Although Garfield did not make additional films with the "East Side" band, the studio had started him with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost immediately for "Dust Be My Destiny". <br /> <br /> Boxing scenes are nicely staged. But the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of New York's "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climbed into a huge water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives at risk. Other, more short, highlights include Floozy Ann Sheridan (like Goldie), Boozy Barbara Pepper (like Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (like Douglas) losing on strip poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They made me a criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
