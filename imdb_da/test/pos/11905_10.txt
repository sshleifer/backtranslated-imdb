I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Only the characters pull you into the movie. The management was also magnificent. The most creative images I've ever seen. I was stuck on the screen throughout the movie, not a scene was slow. The film also has many action-packed scenes, cars blowing up, etc. The movie is just a whole masterpiece. If you like real entertaining movies, look at this because you will be on the edge of your seat all the time. I put this movie on my top ten all-time list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and that's my type of movie.2 thumbs up completely !!!!!!!!!
