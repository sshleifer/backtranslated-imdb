No, it's not Citizen Kane. But would you expect to be with a name like "meatballs"? It's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. Is there any quote "Little Darlings" line for line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of the movies that came into my brain when I was in junior high and stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel geeky, I mumble "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz." Or when we walk in the brush in the woods, I tell my husband: "I am Wudy da Wabbit." (He doesn't get it). "It just doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter." I think these things are classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the DVD. Wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a presentation of. But the film itself is a perfect snapshot of life as a youth in the late 70s. Maybe not my life ... You can't help but will run around in the woods in shorty shorts and knee-high socks and feathers every time you watch this movie.
