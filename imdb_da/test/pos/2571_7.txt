In "Black Snake Moan", writer director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt dismissing the entire movie as pretentious - a roaring southern parable with some oh-so-risky topic. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtitle, where religion is drawn into the picture - again this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the movie is increasingly blowing its edge until the entire production comes out with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I admit that the last 15 minutes go too far into the "Happy Ending" area to my liking) . And that's not to mention the archive movie of the musician Son House, who rumors about love and death (and heavily foreshadowing things to come, of course). Yet in a strange way, these prejudices are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan", the tale of aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently dumped by his wife (for his brother no less) coming across death nympho rae (Christina Ricci, who easily gives the hottest depiction of the trailer's trash can on celluloid ever); cares the girl back to health, he drives her to his radiator to overcome her demons and hopefully solve her own fallen self. While there is a certain clever appeal in seeing Ricci fall out of his skimpy outfits, her performance is risky and mature - not a trace of Wednesday's Addams that exists, and she easily holds Jackson, who personifies "blues" in his portrait of an erroneous, godly man. While the big hand Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning / blackout, it's convincing, like a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you want you to be there. The setting is strong and a case can be made for the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who claims Raes libido), which is a deliberate propagation of superstition and spirituality. And that is the conviction with which this spirituality is played, which gives "Black Snake Moan" a great deal of its strength - Jackson's and Ricci's gifted notions make this a movie that goes from scary to uplifting with, well seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot I could have done without, neither he nor the sledgehammer's subtlety can keep this from being a fascinating meditative movie.
