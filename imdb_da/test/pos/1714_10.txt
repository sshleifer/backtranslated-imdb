For those who have access to BBC or CBC, it has proved spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from scratch. But in the case of Dr. Who saved the best parts. I can't believe I'm saying this but ... this is by far the best dr, who. This has none of the cheap production values ​​and sometimes slow plowing of the old show. The action is quite good and there is a true sense of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily the same as the great Tom Baker, and the author (former QAF leader) seems to have made even the little characters come alive. I know ... I'm gushing. .but this should be on every sci-fi geeks list. I just don't know why it's not been here. Whatever you do ... if you ever loved Dr. Who or sci-fi .. see this !!!
