I enjoyed this movie a lot. It combines effective humor, imagination and a few moments of horror with a solid film that makes Higuchinsky's effort. Brilliant visuals and a very original story about spirals. My only complaints are that it had its boring moments and was not as bold as it could have been. Nevertheless, I give this a solid 8 out of 10. The US should take note of this and other fine Japanese horror / fantasy films that have come together recently and have them available on Region 1 DVD. In fact, Asian cinema generally has some of the finest movies that have been unnoticed by the American public because they are hard to find. I highly recommend people to look for these treasures they are hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.
