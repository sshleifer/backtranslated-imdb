The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and all about it. 13 years later I am now 17, and decided to see it a month ago, because I am taking a 1960 class in school. I didn't really know what to expect since it was 13 years since I last saw it, but I was totally blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and now I find myself singing along with each song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the "hippie group" leader, who always gets what he wants in one way or another (except in the end of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, Oklahoma Draftee, falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is lovely as the primary and real rich girl who ultimately raises her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as cute as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as sweet and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays the Fathers Day, has a great voice. <br /> <br /> However, the only problem I have with this movie is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are hardly ever shown together, and when they are, they struggle (remember the skinny dipping scene?). It seems that their relationship is very weak, and at the end of the movie we believe they are crazy in love, based only on the few meetings they had. I also see that many people write reviews here are disturbed by the PG rating this movie has. Personally, I would raise the rating to a PG-13, only because there is some drug use ... but remember in 1979, PG-13 did not exist. I don't think nudity is bad, it's not at all sexual (in fact there is no sex in this movie at all), and it's just to show the childish innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered bad, and I cannot see why it is here in the United States. In any case, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it was made again then, because today they wouldn't think about doing it, and even though they did it in the insane "politically correct" world of Today would be a very "water" version, and I'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. <br /> Finally, this is a very underrated movie that is definitely worth checking out.
