I have never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, laughed myself silly and hit the R button on Sky +. I'm glad I did !! I hope I don't offend anyone (because BF and I loved the basics!) But we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially the occupied (which I understand is a great Bollywood star because we've seen him on the face of lots of dvds since and i once saw a doll of him today in hamleys !! BF continues with these blocks - i'm starting to think he's obsessed! He says it's odd for the traditional great one to be anti-hero in a movie! But then we like movies that are not your stock predictable Hollywood ticket). It was all over the top, but really good fun. If all Bollywood movies are like this, we'll see more. I've had the bloomin 'song in the head all week and I can't speak a word of Hindi! PS any recommendations would be appreciated!
