This movie just felt very true to life. I liked the end, which seemed to solve naturally without big moments, but with many small moments that came together. You can tell it's an honest love story. It doesn't matter what the main characters "sexual orientation" is, it's still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes involving the family. The setting is below what for some people is a very stressful time. Namely the "holiday." Christmas to be precise. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, this issue deals with love, incorporation, expectations and non-overcome obstacles. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice for each other by knowing that love is difficult and about giving. Well done.
