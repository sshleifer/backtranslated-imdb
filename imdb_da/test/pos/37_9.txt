This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I go as far as setting it up with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young bi-racial boy living in a guest house run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka "Nanny". You fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other cast members do the same. If I were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles, I should probably mention everyone in the whole role. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie fits perfectly with the story, almost dictating the way it goes. And what's more, this movie is actually entertaining. It won't bore you at all, not even for a moment! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend an evening at home and watch a very smart, very entertaining movie.
