Okay, if this movie had been made much later in the history of the cinema, it would not be worth it. But in 1898, movies were in their infancy, and they were almost all boring and had no real stories to tell - rather than simply showing ordinary everyday people doing everyday activities. Looking today, almost all of them are hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than a minute long! And so in the light of this, this short clip of a movie is pretty swollen and can just make you laugh. Two boys, one mill and one chimney sweep into each other - falling and throwing flour and coal dust over each other while they break. IT'S ALL - the movie is over before you know it.
