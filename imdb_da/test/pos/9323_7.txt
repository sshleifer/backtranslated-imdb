Musical bios are all cut from the same cloth. Hopeful battles, succeed and finally win the girl, but this - a life of the Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - has more for it than the usual stairs. It has great charm and great sincerity and is beautifully played by all concerned. Dennis Morgan is fine in the lead, just as Arlene Dahl is his girlfriend interest. Andrea King's supportive performance as Lillian Russell is far superior to Alice Faye's leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career. William Frawley touches the aging tenor master, William Scanlon, and Sara Allgood is lovely as Olcot's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale provide good support. There are over 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come down My Evening Star; My Nellie's Blue Eyes; You tell me your dream; Wait till the sun shines, Nellie; Want to love me in December? By the Light of the Silvery Moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If I dream Wee Rose of Killarney; Shake hands; A little girl; A bit of heaven; Mary; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When Irish Eyes Smile Mor Machree; Kerey Fair; Room in my heart; My Wild Irish Rose. Even though the movie has only received an Oscar nom to Scoring - and deserved, it also deserves nods to Art Direction and Costume Design - sumptuous and delightful in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Reasons why this is not video may be due to the large amount of time spent in the Minstrel Show atmosphere - at least a quarter of the movie - with a lot of material rather politically incorrect for today's audience . It is historically accurate, though. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and well worth finding out. It leaves one with a warm glow.
