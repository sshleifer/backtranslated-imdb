This movie was soooooooo good! It was fun! There are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love these guys! I also love the adventures they went on. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is great too! I love to sing along with all the songs!
