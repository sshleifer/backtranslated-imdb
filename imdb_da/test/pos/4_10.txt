Unfortunately, this film was undermined, but turned out to be quite unusual. Entering the Theater I knew nothing about the movie, except that a friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was captured with high quality film. I couldn't picture Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really showed his character. This movie is unusual and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other films. It won't be easy for me to recommend any movie, but in this case, I strongly recommend that everyone watch it. <br /> <br /> These movies are truly exceptional!
