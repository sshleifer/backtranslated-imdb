It was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out. Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the tracks" in the "40s movie) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely and even plays a double role as Rusty and Rusty are grandma Rusty has a chance in the big time through John Coudair (Otto Kruger) who romanticized and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The reason is about Danny cutting loose Rusty , to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance of success that he cannot give her, but of course that is not what Rusty ultimately wants, because as the usual in film at that time, the right guy is the only one Things on the girl's mind There are no surprises, but everyone does their thing well. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances the first of his amazing tricks, this time with himself as a reflection of a glass window. that kind of dance, and one must still wonder how they timed everything so p frankly, he really seems to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a little thick and there are some free war references thrown in the low, but allows for a song or two, but Kelly takes this movie to the next level. It was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good. An underlying edge of rawness to his character makes it a credible and almost wistful air. <br /> <br /> Kelly's character in the 1980's "Xanadu" was also called Danny McGuire. This movie was the beginning, the movie end, a great race for a dancing genius. It was clear that this movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
