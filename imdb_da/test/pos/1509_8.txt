I couldn't help reviving the whole of CAT IN THE BRAIN, because it obligedly explains that a director is getting angry and sees people killed by previous films he has made. Even earthly activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running taps give some horrible slaughterhouses from a movie in the past. Director Fulci plays himself, manages GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And cannot seem to deprive his mental well-being of constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a means of performing a number of innocent people who hypnotize the instructor to believe he might be responsible. This is, of course, a movie that playfully jumps fun on Fulci's image while exploring the themes of how such a profession that produces so much death and destruction, rarely untamed, could push and shape an inheritance. The film has virtually a social history that surrounds non-stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in pig details. This has a shower kill Hitchcock could never directly or probably will. The film's wildness complements the mental state of Fulci's Fulci (.. I know) over time. Reality and film fiction have melted, and Fulci can't find any escape. The end (.. explains the old cliché: "It's just a movie") couldn't work better than it does here. Fulci's boat says Perversion (.. excellent touch) and he sails out. I can only wish this was his final movie because it is a perfect close if ever there was one. David L Thompson is the counterfeit psychiatrist who plans to kill his incredible wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a policeman Fulci fear had a family murdered by the enemy. <br /> <br /> The ultra-violence in the movie has lots of unique ways to put your head on like a chest door, a scythe, a chainsaw and a hatchet. The most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces (.. how a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits nicely into a nightmarish hallucination sequence) .. the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy being beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away and celebrating on Fulci's brain is a shelf. The scenes spliced ​​in the movie, with a horrified Fulci, are obvious, but I couldn't help but enjoy it anyway.
