I caught this on the local Mexican television at 2:00 am and I decided to give it a try as it is based on a real-life case that deals with the murder of the typical All American family (a father, a mother and one young son). <br /> <br /> Initially, Walker points to being the killer as he had strong differences with his father. Shortly after Walker and Luke are taken to the Sheriff's Dept. Being investigated by the lie discovery machine, it turns out that things are very different ... Even when Walker and Luke participate in an agreement with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke would receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. In any case, this is an excellent mystery film dealing with scams, ambition, emotions and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real name was changed, but the experience is still the same. Give this movie a try. I know there are HUNDREDS of "based on real murder" or similar events, but this one is really worthy. Clean quality of acting, direction and plot.
