Back when I was working, I remember having a really disgusting client to deal with who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I told him things that my agency could do and couldn't do, and he certainly believed that I was personally unable to make him do what was right for him. I swear, but I was thinking of this guy when I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their wits battle. In The Line of Fire, Clint threw Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent at work in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. He has had his doubts ever since and has been drinking, and his life at one time was a real shame. He has returned to the White House details now, and when a potential assassin's hostess rats on her rents for the secret service, it is Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draws the case. <br/> <br /> But the killer is no ordinary crank case. He is a professional at his work, educated and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Oscar nomination for the Best Support Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive, and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. Strangely, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge of breaking into his apartment while he was at work, and he insisted on personalizing the whole case. He calls Eastwood the whole movie and cheats him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does, Clint gets really personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential murders we have had in our history have been fortunate amateurs unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories of some of the killings. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined courage, is the most dangerous kind of enemy. <br /> <br /> Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as science leaders (and would be real-life president), Rene Russo as another agent who falls to Eastwood's masculine charm, John Mahoney as the secret service manager , Gary Cole as the white house secret service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is on, he owns The Fire Of Fire. The climate with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
