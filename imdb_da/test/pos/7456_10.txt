Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the United States is the "Duckman" card of 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the often innocuous criticism found in "The Simpsons" (a pretty good show in itself), and the rude-for-rudeness of "South Park" follows every bit of this series a plan. The criticism of American society, from its mercantilism to its egoism, bears much more bite than it does in another animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in the "Duckman" also tend to be unclear sometimes (some browsing fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). Thus, it is different from "The Simpsons" that usually uses pop culture instead of high-brow stuff often stored in "Duckman." As other people write about it, there is a growth in the signs (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also by making the protagonist not just an offensive neurotic, but actually one who lives a personal tragedy (as evidenced by episodes such as "The Once and Future Duck" ('You will love her until the end of your days .. .) and in "Bev takes a vacation" (when he takes a chance to tell Beverly all the things he couldn't tell Beatrice), the series is rooted in a deep sense of reality. <br /> <br /> can not help but be sad and his clear madness. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think the best cartoon ever made in the United States and one of the best series ever. Ever been on DVD, too many things, said Duck, give much more meaning today.
