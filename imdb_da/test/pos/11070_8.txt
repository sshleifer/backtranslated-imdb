I thought Nick Gomez looks at New Jersey's ugly streets, where the billiards are full-time, were both thoughtful and entertaining. It's as good as movies like Boyz n Hood or Menace II Society or Over the Rim. I thought the actors and scenarios were suitable, it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, whether appropriate or by chance. I liked this movie a lot, an undervalued gem I found on TV and glad I caught it. Go see this movie if you get a shot. If they do not have a DVD, they must release one. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
