The basis of this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever. <br /> <br /> STUEY is a tight, coherent biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one-way highway to Hell with a few detours. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature is far apart from other films about poker. It represents a rare and serious attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling coercion. The complete obsession that destroys any closeness of spirituality and abolishes any chance of redemption. This is the least likely movie a Vegas Casino executive would recommend. And that's the only poker DVD you'd probably find on the shelves of Gamblers Annonymous. There are scenes in this movie that poker buffs will surely refer to as some of the best playing scenes ever. Stu reads his opponent's hand and especially a Texas Hold'em blues scene. <br /> <br /> Prophetic, early in the movie, we see a young Stu bullied out of the pocket shift by a bunch of neighborhood heads. Poker is for loners seeking revenge. It's a patience game that bullies are missing. "You can't bully me!" may well be an underlying sense of the punishment that a master poker player releases on his opponents. <br /> <br /> Conservatives will look at this movie as a warning of a soul lost in sin. They can awaken Mark Twain: "The best throw on dice is to throw them away." The young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplified and sympathetic perspective. They may not have heard of Twain's quote, but will surely remember a remark from Stu's anesthetized friend who learns from the upcoming Stuey that he had won a car from a local character in an overnight game. "You tell them to go to hell and they look forward to the trip." <br /> <br /> The mosaic of Las Vegas vignettes that we see in STUEY will slowly remain in memory. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget it! No tip as extravagant as a hot-shot gambler. And for visitors in Vegas who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay, check out the stage at Stu to check out a hotel in Vegas! <br /> <br /> 'This was what I should do is where I should be. Hollywood movie stars, Washington politicians and Vegas players. '
