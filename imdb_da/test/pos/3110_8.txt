Recently I watched this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom on a plane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I suggest this? <br /> <br /> Or is this part of "clean-up" of movies where some have been changed to exclude parts that some believe are not "appropriate"? <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's like the friendship between a friend and I, and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together. Her husband thought it was us too. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Joan
