Overall, I give this movie a decent 7.6. To begin with I would like to say that I love how the character was portrayed and adapted to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or just watch DVD extras, then you can see that the Blade character is drastically different from what we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire and therefore acquires "all their forces but none of their weaknesses". The credit for this goes naturally to David Goyer, a co-author of the darker genre of comics. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite heroes really. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some would probably have worsened Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His performance here doesn't have to be exactly Oscar to win by. Says in consideration of the character, but I'm glad he decides to play DayWalker in the two successors. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our biggest villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The action is actually good and the action keeps the plot safe. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I have to say. As much as this movie, there are few things that disturb me that take away from this movie ranking with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I had not so much honestly. Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really seem like a cartoon to me. Plus, "La Magra" a bit disappointing as the final villain, but the intense sword fight does well, I think. Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather jacket with a sword beaing # $% out of a policeman in the broad day, some shed light on how to go unnoticed by the crowds that went a little, seemed good . ..stupid. Move away from a couple of its flaws, the music of Mark Isham was great and fitted the movie nicely. Fortunately, all these issues are addressed and improved in the amazing sequel, "Blade 2".
