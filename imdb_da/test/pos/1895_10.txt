If you watch this movie, you will quote it and refer to it for a long time to come. It's been years since I saw Dolemite and I still quote it to this day. It's a true classic. It is so fun-numbingly terrible that it makes a hilarious view. Every terrible dialogue line is amazing. Each wobbly shot a work of art (?). And every stroke and kick so violently executed. You will not believe in your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really get into how fascinating this movie is, I won't be able to stop and I go way beyond the IMDb 1000 word limit. <br /> <br /> Please see this movie. You will be in hysteria. Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
