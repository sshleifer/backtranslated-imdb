This movie is excellent The passion between Jade & Billy is memorable and the play was amazing. Therefore, you do not leave a 16-year-old and a young man alone! It shows why a single mother should not dance a younger man with a teenage animal daughter in the house because he is so young enough to be Judy's son. <br /> <br /> I give it ten out of ten, The acting was great, and the movements between the actors were correct. The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good because they were the same in age. All in all, it's fun. movie but i think no one under 13 should watch this movie because of sexual scenes.
