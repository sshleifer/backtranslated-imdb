The problem I have as Finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every Finnish movie. I have a feeling that Finland only has five players. I think if you are not from Finland, you really like this movie as a refreshing news. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a terrible event chain that affects a few people quite hard. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness can all be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. A lot of people in Finland have depression, especially in winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is very melancholy. I enjoyed it and Louhimes' instruction was again very solid. I liked this movie a lot, only negative thing is that you see the same faces that you have seen over and over again.
