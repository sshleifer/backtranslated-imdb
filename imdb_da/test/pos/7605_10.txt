'Never Been Kissed' is a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it out. I will buy it when it is released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, she plays her part well. I felt that I could relate to this movie because of the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance, which is the type of movie I love. I loved the end because even though you know what will happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating !!
