I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl in heart. There are no movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing about it was when one of the boys said "stupid". I welcome them to step out and make a real family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know how to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can't stop talking about it. It comes with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one. She even called one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can't say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more movies like this one.
