I enjoyed this program tremendously. It is exceptionally well written with fine judgments and clear visuals. It is also very honest and honest, refreshing in relation to the sanitized representation of drug use in film and television. <br /> <br /> Unmissable - one of the finest TV shows in recent years and victories on all scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
