John Ford paid the wagons his tribute to a special image, 'Wagon Master' made after two great Indian-cavalry epics ... It is a lovely poetic movie full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit ... It did not top the great who had preceded it ... <br /> <br /> Photographic it's extremely simple ... The camera only moves once or twice throughout the movie, and never when an instructor would have made it move for to emphasize a shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight of the women who wear marches together in the dust behind their carts ... They come and go - while the camera remains motionless and the audience remains one spectator of the story, not a participant in it ... Of course, when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'Stagecoach', he just knows how to do it ... But the "Wagon Master" is a sore, nostalgic look backwards ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional western songs made by The Pioneer's Sons, it tells of the trek West to Utah (in 1879) of a Mormon truck combination led by Ward Bond in the role of older Wiggs and two young horse traders (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.). And in a series of beautiful images that the lorry is fighting for crimes, Indians and nature in its struggle to reach the "Promised Land", the modest "Wagon Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br /> < br /> Ford himself has said that the "Wagon Master" (which he wrote the original story) was among the three films of his "almost what I wanted to achieve." <br /> <Ford's career as a Western Director was astonishing ... More than anyone else, he could use the genre to protect his feelings about the family, society, and American lifestyle ... Ford saw the border as a land to be subdued by a special class settlers and lawmakers whose great sacrifices make the earth safe from those who come after ... These early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they served and the civilized citizens who followed should always keep them in fear and respect ... Ford's westerns often use flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach ... <br /> <br /> In the 'Wagon Master', folk song songs on the soundtrack tell us about the parents' pioneers a century ago, and Ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion. In a row, the train is camped in a circle, and the settlers decide to hold a square dance ... To form a dance floor they must lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the desert through the metaphor of boarding the land ... It is a nice to watch movie, full of wonderful light-hearted optimism, and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying? It never breaks the belief in the mood and style of the first few sequences ?? But you are wondering whether the ultra-romantic is best suited to the chosen theme? The wagon-train experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nerve-racking trials that man (with his womankind) ever sat down? It must have been riddled with doubts? Was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How will we fight the other end ?? almost every other pain step? <br /> <br /> But none of this feeling really comes through in the "Wagon Master". The journey such as the general ebullience does not strike one as particularly dangerous ?? It could of course be that the Mormons were so "high" in religious spirit that this used to act as an anesthetic ?? In other words, their reactions were not those with normal human weakness. If so, Ford was right, and the doubt was wrong. <br /> <br /> What is undoubtedly the right and right ebullience, especially at the first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of light hearted adventurous youth, especially a sense of western youth in these extraordinary times ?? It is a remarkable relationship and it remains in the mind ??
