I've noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show. I have all 26 episodes broadcast in the United States and will be willing to share these with anyone interested. All I require is that you supply VHS tapes or blank DVDs. I have them on both formats and pay for shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, send me an email and your request and I will notify you and we can make the arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very pleasant to see especially if you have not been able to see them since they were sent in the 60s. It was one of my favorite programs as a child and has a very special place in my heart because it brings many memories of my childhood with other shows like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
