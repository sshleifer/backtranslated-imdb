It is quite obvious that many of your nights were spent alone. If you saw 5 minutes on the show itself instead of watching the ad, you would have seen one of the biggest TV shows in Canadian history. Too bad you would have seen it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... no fight. Keys for VIP are fun, bright and fun. Guys will eat this show. My game is tight and I can hardly wait to get on this show. The chickens were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked ass. I want to see every week. It makes me wonder why several great shows like this are not made. Now, it is clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television.
