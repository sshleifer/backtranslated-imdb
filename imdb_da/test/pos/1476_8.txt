Sam Elliot is brilliant as a tough San Francisco detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed during a meeting with an informant Fallon schnapps, the informant beats death and dumps his body into a river. The next day Fallon falls to a beginner's partner and has the task of investigating the informant's murder. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man tortured by the blame in his own murderous acts and grief over his partner's death, which may have been involved in police corruption.
