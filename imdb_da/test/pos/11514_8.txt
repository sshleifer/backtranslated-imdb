As far as I knew, it was my first experience with Icelandic films. It is such a relief to see something other than your regular Hollywood movie. Too bad that movies like this have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope people see this by accident, by recommendation or otherwise ... Because it's really worth it. I left the cinema's feeling really sad. I couldn't get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And that impressed me even more when I thought about the complexity of the film. Not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, see it! It's really thoughtful and made me think a lot. <br /> <br />
