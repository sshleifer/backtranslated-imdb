I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally found this DVD title from the shelves of a Shenzhen bookstore after a long search in many places. This is a great departure from former Zhang Yimou work, especially in style and style. The director himself has said that this is the first and only time he will ever try to make a black comedy in today's China. You can even say that this work is experimental in relation to his other well-known large budget and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a handheld camera and wide-angle lens throughout the entire movie, the fast paced editing and high energy performance and naturalistic tone never let you go when it grabbed you from the start. It presents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban feelings, which in this case is set in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will absolutely love this movie. Also watch funny comos by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> One final point: I find the characters in this movie as in any other Zhang Yimou movie, showing similar personality traits - stubbornness that always tries to beat the odds and up. Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
