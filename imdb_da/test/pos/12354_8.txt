Sheba Baby is always underestimated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating a Grier movie gets. All that PG means is that Pam doesn't take her out, she takes her into every other movie she's been in anyway. It's more exciting than Coffy, more action. It slowly takes off, but when it is on the screen, the voltage has started. Like Dolemite d'urville Martin is the heavy trying to get Sheba's father, but she doesn't. She makes a women's war against Martin and his gang of curses. The best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car, which I still laugh about. I thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating, but I was wrong, it replaces sex with violence and in a blax flotation movie that can only be good!
