I thought this movie was really good. It ends up showing the viewers eventually that Leila should keep what she had. Leila was sick of her husband Jim, who was more worried about work than her. He was then into his work that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very sloppy. She couldn't take it anymore so she went to see if he would miss her. The film shows that he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night when he smashed. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He seemed like the man she had always wanted to be nice and notice her. In the end, she sorta foreshadows when she looks at schuyler's shoes and the way he let his cigar ash fall to the floor the way jim did the same kind of thing. Jim ends up making a lot of money and cleaning up. Leila finally believes she should keep her husband because it was all she really wanted and he changed.
