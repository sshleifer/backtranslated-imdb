The man who knew too much {1956} is a remake of a movie that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later efforts are far better. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock claim that remake is mediocre and does not have the spine that spins the tip of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, with the exception of the original set in Switzerland and remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation with their young son and meets a suspicious man who is very curious about their past. It just so happens, he's an agent looking for a couple involved in a plot to murder a world leader. Then he gets stuck in a marrakeck market because it is discovered that he is a spy and continues to fall into Stewart's arms. Death, he tells him the whole story of the murder plot. Stewart and Day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and kidnapped their son. The film features excellent performances by Stewart and Day, in an equally dramatic role as anxious and frightened parents. This film showed that Doris Day could act in exciting dramas and carefree musicals. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is first class. The film keeps you at the edge of your seat every minute. The scene at Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and sad. I don't know how people can compare the two. Just see the remake and you will enjoy it. I give the movie a 9 out of 10.
