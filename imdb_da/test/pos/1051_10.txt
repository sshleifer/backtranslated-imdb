"Christmas In Connecticut" is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. While less well-known than some others, it is nevertheless a lovely way to spend an evening on vacation. I see it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is the perfect cast as Elizabeth Lane, the only career girl. The road before it was popular, Stanwyck designates the only girl who rises. Her NYC apartment and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur around the corner suggest the only girl in the city's existence. She can't cook yet, she writes a homemaking column for a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan is also the perfect cast as our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a "real" home. That creates the lovely matcap story that evolves. It's fun from the beginning to the end. We should all also have Uncle Felix!
