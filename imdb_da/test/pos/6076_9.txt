Be curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where the film in Italy was finished. I know the name of the villa: However, Villa San Girolamo would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be great to visit this area. I would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is so good. Travel a lot in Europe and Africa and would be interested in visiting the areas that the book and the film were about. Please email me with information about the sites that anyone may have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, it would also be great. I await any information and I thank you in advance for your time.
