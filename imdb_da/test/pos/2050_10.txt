This is movie is actually one of my favorites all the time. I'm not a Renny Harlin fan because most of his movie sucks, but TLKG hits its mark time and again. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) suffering from amnesia. she is married to a child and as she says "I am a bad member of PTA." And then her world will crumble as the pieces fall into place about her former identity. Samuel Jackson plays an artist cop who does PI-gigs, he is pulled by her to solve his identity and to pay some money for his work. In the way we find out, Samantha is really Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy that was abandoned in recent years. The reason is great, making this story a reality, and Jackson does a good job as a second fiddle to Davis (who always does a great play). The explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with a memorable scene after a memorable scene. pretty impressive visually, though the baby came on my nerve at the end (beware of the cars!) I am tired of young children screwing up a movie to be saved but still worth this movie that the baby adds to the movie. Again, this movie is really good, I never understood why it didn't do more at the box office, but if it was a man starring in the movie, I'm sure it would have broken hundreds of millions. It's good that over the years, more people discover this movie and give it good marks, as the average of this movie on this site has risen over the years. I hope it goes on, as this is a great action movie. and i love action movies
