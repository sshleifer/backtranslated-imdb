The impossible sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse at one of these movie-type asylum seekers, where the responsible doctor has his own, unorthodox ways to treat the inmates. With reluctance to bring her aboard, the officious Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.c. Annabelle Weenick). The inmates are not too friendly to Charlotte either. <br /> <br /> Share Mystery, Part Horror, This Initial Action by B-Movie Director S.F. Brownrigg has a suppressive feel to it. These colorful psychoses, including a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, dominate the screen with their unpleasant presence, a gentle giant who already has a lobotomy, and a supposed judge who speaks in legal jargon. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good image, and sets up the gritty, ugly atmosphere right away. Some short bursts of graphic violence also help give it the good old-fashioned exploiting quality. It builds in intensity as the imperial heroine struggle to maintain its own sanitation and offers a surrealistic encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetry quote, dotty old Mrs. Callingham. For inexpensive 1970's era cheese, it is quite effective with a particularly unpleasant climax. I had a good time seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
