I was five when the show was debuted in 1958 and later was a regular viewer. I remember really enjoying the show along with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", the subject of "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys" etc. I now enjoy the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and have seen the first two episodes. Donna Stone has proven to be an intelligent, well-behaved, problem-solving, peaceful, resident resembling June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Mrs Reed becomes a surrogate father, acting in her dress for sweat and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to physically defend herself against much greater bullying. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood I grew up in, including my own, just met the idealistic standards exhibited by Mrs Reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision making prevails at the end of the day. today's accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among one's neighbors. I can't imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that assault on the neighbors' yards is okay, letting a dog outside bend all day is acceptable or telling their mother to "stop" in a supermarket in front all.
