This must be the stupidest movie I have ever seen and therefore deserves a special prize. OK, so it starts pretty well, logically, humor and changes quickly to complete and pronounce, so it makes sense. The strange thing is that I almost didn't laugh at it, even though it is supposed to be fun, with a very serious message. After a moment of thinking why I'm not laughing, the answer was pretty clear ... this movie is much more realistic, so I'd like it. So it is extremely stupid, yet very wise, if the object was to reach out to people who are not "blessed" with quite a few neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). This movie can actually be understood at some level by a large audience! <br /> <br /> Although they're probably just laughing. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, try ... <br /> <br /> I'm editing (adding) my comment because I read some of the other comments. First, I noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, it was nothing at all when I looked at it. But I can imagine if you look out of that perspective, you will see some. We could of course discuss the connection between intelligence and race, but I don't think it's the place to do it. I wonder if we were to assess the Huxtable family here, would you complain that everyone is black? I don't think so, but I think you could ... (apart from that, from the 2 brightest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem quite caucasian to me, so what's the problem?) <br /> <br /> Second, the film gets very mixed reviews; from 1 to 10 and everything in between, but very polarization there, which means that the film does its job very well! It touches people up, causes them to talk about it and judge it. That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes, it becomes very predictive and boring though, but you continue to see this complete crap. I think you continue to hope this is not the case. Or maybe it's our sick way to look at horrible accidents. Well, that's for sure.
