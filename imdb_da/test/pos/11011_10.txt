Under my teenagers, or should I say, I first "ate" all kinds of SF novels every day of the week. It was in the 60's and 70's when television was not such an important leisure murder as today, one night in the mid-seventies, I watched movies on TV. I think it was ARD and I was stunned. I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember every scene even today. <br /> <br /> Today I see my kids playing SIMS or something, and I think we're close to what the Fassbender Movie was saying. I would also greatly appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD. But in vain I tried almost everything to get a tip where. The film MATRIX can not far remove the quality and knowledge of this film. And by the way now we do not have glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a few simulation models. Probably after our death we will definitely know ...
