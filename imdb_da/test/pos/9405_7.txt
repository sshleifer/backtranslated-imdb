too badly showed the palms that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ... This Martha Moxley case had become "cold" for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided that he would not be remembered only for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson case .... which could have been detrimental to his reputation (if it had not already) followed when the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... using flashbacks we can see the relationship Martha formed .... Unattended boys who are age without a mother around to help and a father who was always looped ... <br /> <br /> Plus in fact they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star ... she was a sweet sweet girl next to the type. Other than that, the other characters were really good, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played as Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were also good, consumers had to keep everything in the 70's look and back to the 90s .... <br /> <br /> It kept my interest, even when I caught on to the Switch guy .. ..
