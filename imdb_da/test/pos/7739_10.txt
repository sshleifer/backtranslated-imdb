What is Prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why should a man choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend? Because it is too difficult to live and love in good conditions in "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken heart giant, he can control the storm. He has power, strengh but he is human. The deep love of life is the subject of this extraordinary film. The action is incredible, the whole genius of John Cassavete, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky of course. Don't miss it, it will be a mistake. This movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.and I've seen a lot of movies.
