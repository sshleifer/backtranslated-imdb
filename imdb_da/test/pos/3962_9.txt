This is a fun, smart movie and worth your time. In my opinion, it's much better than American Pie and other movies of the same genre that seem to be knocked out all the time. I hadn't heard of this movie, so I assume it wasn't very crowded, which is a little shame. It doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time gives a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what's important ... Unlike a movie about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and a guy sticks his d ** k in a pie, but eventually everyone gets laid and who does it ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty amazing and not the usual cheesy american poppunk ... they actually had real punk from back in the day like Ramones ... It made the movie in itself better! To be honest, I don't expect much from this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy is.
