This Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle comedy is best remembered to offer a young Buster Keaton, fresh from splitting with his family's Vaudeville act's home in his film debut. Buster gets a big part in this movie, and it's pretty funny in general. "The Butcher Boy" has lots of laughs and is an example of pure old-fashioned slapstick done well, although apparently it comes from the short era of two-wheeled comedies, as filmmakers still envisioned in one-wheel segments as a course issue. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie takes place in a regular store, with Arbuckle as the title slaughter girl. It is an excuse to remind the many quick physical humor options that a regular store gives, and Arbuckle really turns out to be a 300 pound acrobat that demonstrates subtlety, skill and grace in his performance of what might have been unremarkable slapstick routines that raise them to another level. An ongoing gag causes him to turn a big butcher knife randomly, so it jumps exactly into the right position stuck in the cutting board, and I'm still surprised that Arbuckle really seems to do it every time. There is also a really nice gag that sees him lean on his scale and confuse why his pieces of meat weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a boy who comes in to buy some molasses and fills in a foot-to-floor routine that follows. Apart from the odd and almost disturbing half smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him recognizable as Buster we know. He even has his last trademarked hat - here ruined for the first time when he of course filled with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film moves into more situational comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dress in a row to infiltrate Fatty's boyfriend's boarding school. A lot of humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysterious frightening sight of these two strange comrades wearing drafts and trying to "be girls." Buster is also in this segment, but mostly in the occasional cutaway, St. John. The end of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a bit emptily frenetic, but on the whole and beyond its historic curiosity interest, it's a well-appointed comedy that gets just the knockabout laugh it goes for.
