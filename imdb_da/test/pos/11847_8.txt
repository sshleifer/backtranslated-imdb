I was very impressed with this movie, if only for the comedy. It may not be the most gruesome, humorous humor all the time, but I found it appropriate for all scenes. <br /> <br /> The flow of the movie is definitely a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that's how characters feel. Sometimes we see some slapstick and other scenes are about a crucial discourse on relationships. This can be a little frustrating for certain viewers, but it brings me closer to the character's dilemmas of irregular chaos. The action is amazing from everyone. I'm a big Andy Richter fan, but I wasn't head over his heels as everyone else seems to be. He did really well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. Jay Mohr performs as expected if you have seen him in other movies. I always wanted him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very fun and provides some good foundations for a few types of relationships. When it comes to relationship issues and problems, some movies try to surprise. There is nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it is entertaining to see them being revealed throughout the film.
