When I first looked at this movie, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know that the director almost always has an intention when making a movie. So I decided to see it again. The second time I looked at it, I realized that Albert Puyn is a very talented and very original film producer. In the beginning, the viewer was told that the film took place a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a design typical of the 1950s. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think that means the movie's real time is not set. The music in the film creates a long music video that tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics, especially for intro and outro. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses red and blue back colors when he shows the symbols of communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). One can notice that Ice-T, named Mao (Communism) and that when in focus, is the back color red. The American politician, starring Burt Reynolds, is always filmed with blue color. The club, where Mao and his gang hang out, is also red in color. Crazy Six is ​​commuting between the red and blue colors. <br /> <br /> The white little dog that Mao had at the beginning symbolizes, I believe, the governing force. Mao had the dog in the beginning, but the policeman finally took it. It symbolizes, I believe, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist way of thinking from the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a great movie. Albert Puyn creates a sci-fi / action film with a political depth. It is different, but a very special film about communism falls in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing another spectacular movie by Albert Puyn.
