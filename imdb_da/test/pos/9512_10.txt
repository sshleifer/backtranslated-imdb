I don't know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I found this movie to be one of Japan's most exciting epics to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. For what I know of movies, most disasters in movies are basically run by the mill asteroid flicks or one by Global Warming. This has always been another course. A course of natural means where the crust has begun to eradicate to such an extent that it will take another piece of land with it for the trip. What the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to long and Sinking Japan altogether. In most cases, this will simply be called tectonic shear on steroids. I found the characters quite appealing in every way, from the child who lost her mother only to meet her own death among unknown friends. Or the rescue girl who does everything she can to save lives in the light of the disaster. Or a man who believed that he could change her thoughts of not being such a peat devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world just shaded them all back just to be forgotten by the world turning its back on the Japanese citizens crying for help. This was a fantastic movie in every aspect. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not made by Hollywood that it was made in Japan that it had characters competing with other actors around the world that the effects are very beautiful as he mentioned, but it everything he was waiting for was nothing else. He lacks the vision of what is important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling, greatness and humanity. I thought this movie was top-notch, and I have seen many disaster films knowing that Japan Sinks might have been one of the most original and thought-out projects I've seen. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. Oh and by the way, I'm not Japanese, but in many ways I wish I was. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid movie buffer in all aspects. Predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth considering as an opinion. Dick you should see it with a more open heart and mind, not just look for the eye like that makes a movie content, look for what's more important, and understand it. They may not be American, but the Japanese have recently hit the market for some of the most breathtaking and downward cruel movies that make it to date. That's why spending 25,000,000 is just what the doctor ordered. You've heard right, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now you tell me was it worth it? Or was it worth it because American players were not in it?
