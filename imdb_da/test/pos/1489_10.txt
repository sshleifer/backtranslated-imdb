Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No food, how many times you see the same, the show never becomes monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't have to talk to make people laugh. His movements, his facial expressions and his face are so fun to see. The situations he is facing on the show are simply fun and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show should not receive a 10 because it is great. Its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my all-time favorites episodes from the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean lodges in a hotel 2) The one where he sees the scary movie 3) Remember the baby (the ink scene in particular). In fact, all episodes are so good that it's really hard to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to any height to prove he's fun, including completely stripping one of the episodes. The way he handled was simply the mind blowing. 10 out of 10
