I agree with all the strenghts mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it in the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the borders for the "elements" that make up film noir - not to say that the big movies noirs are not / cannot / should not be good dramas, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Another note of music in movies is sparingly used, but I would say it is used to accentuate the action more often than the royal family. <br /> <br /> Amazingly seen for this movie by the way, with an abrupt kind of non-ending end that is either just right or a downfall depends. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow some specifications. <br /> <br /> The big walk in history involves kids watching their mother die, or it must be the big moment. But the children are never shown to react in one way or another. Neither crying nor asking their father what happened, the children are good actors, and the father's reactions I assume, what matters, but it is a big mistake. This is the heart of history and the children are mostly kept blank in their reaction. They really just have none, in the next scene they look as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, there is a bond that forms between Belmondo and Ventura's characters. Belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed - but it has never been explained and has no influence on Belmondo or anyone else. Belmondo's romantic subplot also comes with credibility, even though it convincingly acted. Ventura's character only allows Belmondo to involve a total stranger in their flight plan for no reason. He doesn't even notice or seem to notice. Another hole. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie and I will not spoil it, the end of the screen with a perfect voice to tell you what happened. I suppose this is trying to make it feel more true in life, but again as if these other failures leave drama from the screen. What is the purpose of not dealing with these problems? I don't know, except maybe the movie's goal was limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melody - suggesting some deeper elements, so keep ignoring them. <br /> <br /> Also bad, there is much to recommend this movie, Ventura is very very good, but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime story - as with IMDb favorite movie all the time THE GODFATHER . This film had potential. Would make a good remake, but if it is done in the United States, more problems would probably sink the movie, but in the hands of the right instructor it would be a good remake, even though it is doubtful that Ventura's performance could be peaked. <br /> <br /> So worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
