For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece did not receive well-deserved recognition and has been underestimated by many American film critics. So it is easy to understand that I have encountered many problems trying to find this movie. Finally I looked at it and it was so beautiful, sincere and exciting that for the first time in my life I saw a movie five times a week after getting the tape. The story is focused on the friendship between two young boys Erik and Dexter, eleven and twelve, who are very different from each other, but they become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been shown in Cure as sincerely and naturally as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful, profound and oblique scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and cannot leave anything humanly indifferent to them. The film is also full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism (especially strong with Erik's shoes), which also increases visual impression from a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well-written and on the contrary an overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood products virtually all scenes. Each sentence and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and gives something important about signs and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who, as I knew, had no major film-directing experience before, showed his great abilities and talents in this area. The cinematography is also fantastic with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important thing is perfect, which with all of the above makes The Cure one of the best movies ever. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. Only one this movie (I haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to mention them as one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also gives a fantastic performance as Dexter's mother. It is terribly boring that such talented actors did not get wide acclaim, while many overstated stars enjoy great publicity and great pay. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtracks written by David Grusin and amazing Mark Cohn's song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in the movies). My big escape. So all I can say about The Cure is a simple word ?? large. At any point of view, this film is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspirational work of all people involved in making this masterpiece. I have to credit all the people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and Universal Pictures, which among many formal commercial projects have found a way to make a beautiful movie. But such films are so rare for cinemas that very often the studios themselves do not know which gem they have made that they cannot deliver their respective marketing campaign. The only minor drawback to Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have the opportunity to watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad English.
