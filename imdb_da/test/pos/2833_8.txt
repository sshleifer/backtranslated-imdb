... I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown 54 years ago I was nine, and today I still remember every black and white frame, especially the blacks, because it was so tense, scary , the insidious attacks through the dark passage in the mountain, the two soldiers, the prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last fight with the uncovered by the cart with Gatling in the fired away, the last battle between Peck and that boss and the smooth end that makes me breathe again. I haven't seen it since then, and I don't know if it would be a good idea to see it again today, it was a great moment for the child I was.
