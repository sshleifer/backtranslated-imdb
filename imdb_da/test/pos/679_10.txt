When Ida Lupino appeared or directed a movie in the 30s, 40s and 50s, you were guaranteed good entertainment even though the picture was black and white. Ida was able to catch the audience and keep them spellbound until the end of her pictures. In this movie, like Mrs Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", 41 along with Robert Ryan, (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves," 40, she keeps you guessing how the relationship will show up and how little Mrs. Gordon will be able to get. a normal and good marriage with love and true love. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of a criminal in a woman's prison and jailer who was hated, it's the movie you can enjoy. I really think Ida Lupino didn't get the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry !!!
