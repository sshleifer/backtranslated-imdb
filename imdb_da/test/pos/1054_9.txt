I just got this movie for Christmas and have already added it to my favorite list. A sweet and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have their mouth water on the sound of all that food. Definitive points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance by Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloane, the impossible boring fiance. Really a gem to be seen every Christmas.
