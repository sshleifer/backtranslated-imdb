(Possible * SPOILERS * warning) <br /> <br /> You never know. The guy says he's a stranger, but ... oops, seems to be the most human in the whole story. Arrived from the remote plane. Said strange things. Advanced Earth Science. Healed the doctor ... Or was it just a crazy dream? You never know. Better see K-PAX for yourself. Think. <br /> <br /> Great play by all the cast. Don't forget to notice the music, it's right in one place. Very funny, a little sadness. 8 out of 10, after all.
