any movie that has a dialog that goes something like this .... "Judy gets ready for her date, Butthole!" must be good! I found this on DVD with no rating, unprocessed and was pleasantly surprised that much work was done to make this movie. I have actually enjoyed the fact that many 80's movies I've seen. Great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The build was fantastic, scaring the rest of the movie. Loved GORE and T&A. I never thought the eyeballs were carved, would look like popping boils, the color of the eye splatter was gross! Still thinking, "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but more black, does anyone agree?
