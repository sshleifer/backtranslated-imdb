When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the American bio's history." It wasn't quite heavy in the cheek. TW & TL remains Milius' best work, and it is boring that he has so little opportunity to work any more. However, TW & TL remains a striking display of what was once known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's excellent portrayal of Teddy R. (Naturally Milius - and Keith - admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including "The Rough Riders.") It is hard to film this movie at any level: a great action balance, life, relationships, and the serious issue in America that ages in the world. Moreover, TW & TL has an extraordinary appeal across the table: Please note that the statistics show that it corresponds best to less than 18 men, women 18-29 and over 45! It was clear that Candy Bergen beat a responsive chord with women as well as men.
