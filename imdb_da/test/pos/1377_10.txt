Okay, so maybe it's because I'm from the north east of Scotland and I'm talking like the guys in this movie, but I found this fun. Inexpensive fun to be safe, but there is plenty of effort to make the movie look good and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually done right when they died. In particular, when the captain finally fell. The script? Make it; s a 2-half game. The open half of the film is well-written and sharp. The last half hour is not that big, with many questions left unanswered. This will undoubtedly annoy others as it annoyed me. But nevertheless, good fun and a very smart first feature from Sturton.
