Being a huge die-hard Monkey Island fan, I fugured this would be terrible when Ron Gilbert didn't. Boy was I surprised! Although it is still not as good as the first two, it has the comedy I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine, and just the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite people. I especially enjoyed the fact that SWORD FIGHT had returned. And the whole story of finding the big unsecured ring was just amazing. Go ahead and try this two-cd adventure. And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island comes out really soon! This fall!
