I ran through the canals and had to stop and laugh when I came across this movie. It was so clear about teenagers in the early 80's, and I called my mother "hahaha, turn to channel like that and the child looks like father was a child." <br /> <br /> About. Yes. Turns out that this movie is about my father and his friends. Even without being loosely based on my father's childhood, I would say watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ..... bizarre to say the least, apathy is set in teens even then. This is a good "human interest" and shows some weird sides of the psyche.
