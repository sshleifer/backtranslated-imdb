I do not know what it is about the CKY crew, but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly stupid and fun that it's almost comical expertise. Sometimes it makes sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> It made me laugh my ass. A must-have for CKY / Jackass aficionado!
