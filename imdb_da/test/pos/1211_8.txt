In the 1980s in wrestling, the world was simple. Hulk Hogan wanted to go to Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenans cronies or Ted DiBiase and get out victors more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that was how it should be. <br /> <br /> But this night was changing, a new master, a man whom WWE thought would be their husband in the 90s, was crowned. It didn't work. But WWE was right about one thing: Hulkamania was finished and a new order had to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first to be held outside America, began with Rick Martel, who defeated Koko B Ware. Koko never had any good luck at Wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here. <br /> <br /> Next up in the colossal connection Andre Giant and Haku put their team of titles on the line against demolition axis and smash and lost. New take team matches crown. <br /> <br /> Next fight saw earthquake defeat Hercules. Hercules was another guy who did not really succeed at Wrestlemania. Good luck to Brutus Beefcake when he joined Mr Perfect's unbeaten streak. Now I suppose someone had to finish it. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought for a double count in a slow but fun fight, next up in the Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov for 19 seconds. Not really a fight, unfortunately. The barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short match. <br /> <br /> The American dream Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated Macho King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a cluttered mixed roof match. This was the only female wrestling that really took place in WWE at this time. Next up was a fun game when Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheal defeated Orient Express at a fast pace. There were many good teams at this time. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in no match. Next, Ted DiBiase put his most beloved possession, the Million Dollar Championship on the line to Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and figured out so Ted could keep his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer games on the show. Next up the Twin Towers collide as Big Bossman defeats Akeem in short, the order is followed by Rick Rude, who wins a short fight with Jimmy Snuka. Finally, we come to the main event with Hulk Hogan, who puts the WWE title on the line against the Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is an entertaining back and forth battle won by Warrior after Hogan missed a fall. The audience was extraordinary and the match was a great play. <br /> <br /> And then the torch was gone, but would the ultimate warrior turn out to be the champion WWE hoped he would be?
