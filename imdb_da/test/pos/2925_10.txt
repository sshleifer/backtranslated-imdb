One of the most enjoyable aspects of movie viewing is to be lost in a movie. To make it completely wash over you so you absorb it as it is and thus experience it fully. Every time I see it, the Egyptian is such a movie. Over the years, a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone that the film brings instead of its most obvious characteristics. It immediately prohibits remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies inside! The music's haunting chords, seen over the 20th Fox logo, put us into titles of second-class turquoise letters. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we fall into an old vault, where there can be big treasures, mixed with uncertain dangers. (One can imagine Darryl Zanuck ordering, "Do the old one!") So what a dark dramatic story unfolds, all within the same tone that is set in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Of Hollywood's mid-50s 'Egyptian trilogy', 'The Ten Commandments' depicted the stubbornness of the civilists, the phenomenal 'Pharaoh's Land' its nuts and bolts, while 'the Egyptian' shows everything from glamor to tragedy for us to wonder. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say much about the players here, but I think Bella Darvi will be redeemed over time. What a perfect face for the role, right out of a symbolic painting. If her plays do not need anything, she can be argued that in her role as "courtesan" she is obviously better in bed than to pray to some poor helpless admirers. I think Curtiz caught the kinkiness in his sado-masochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with aplomb, censorship it was at that time. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was quite kind to 'The Egyptian' and wrote that it was like being lost in a big set to 'Aida'. His pronunciation of the word 'beer' I have ever adopted myself. (One of the film's historically accurate references: The Egyptian invented beer!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect achievement. Gene Tierney what a screen treasure. Become DFZ to give her this 'late' role. C'mon people, don't be so hard on Victor Mature! He is a cheesemaker's son! Who rose to be Pharaoh! It sounds like a special American option. One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observations on the truth of time. And Purdom is an expression of living beyond the world's sunset. If it's not degree 'A' epicness, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, the music is sublime, along with everything else. It is often noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the screen's most convincing parties, completely harmonious, but each theme is well-developed with its own life. Newman, currently pressed by the DFZ, called Herrmann, a person he could rely on implicitly, to take up half the burden. <br /> <br /> Of course, Benny, not the easiest guy to work with, respected Newman enough to really deliver inspirational music. They switched signals, a brilliant approach. No spoilers who did what here, but Benny brings an edge with him, mysterious, amazing sounds. Alfred brings fulsomeness, longing, poignancy. Both are completely epic. Even when looking at a pressurized TV print, the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the main credits that the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could easily accommodate, is the spine. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, Dean of CinemaScope, doesn't let us down here. The lousy greens and moody shadows (probably distortions in all the horrible television prints I've seen over the years) follow perfectly with the multidimensional script (by the great Philip Dunne and WB, Casey Robinson knows who Curtiz must have brought him to 20. ). How remarkable is that Shamroy, who was just as much of a Fox's film institution as Newman was with music, wanted the lens Cleopatra a few years later, but in the lighter, sharper images of the 60s Todd A-O. These old study chambers are really my heroes. <br /> <br /> For me, who will worry about all the imperfections and criticisms in a picture like this? I'd rather give it all to its spelling and dive into the sumptuous sea that emerges after the ultimate climax of the 'End' is updated, moved and hungry for more. And yes, we should cry to the 20th Fox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.
