I was delighted that this movie did without the supposed depth of too many pseudo-serious interracial movies. race was a problem, yes, but it was also class ... and loyalty ... and honesty etc. I also loved the idea that the love affair was not solely placed in 'decorative' aspects of any sign appearance. is not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I daresay!) Now filled with enough couples who thought 'looks good. together.' is all that is required to make a solid marriage? In any case, both characters' tenderness and sensuality were thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a rainbow to every sad day! in other words, a light hearted movie that is by no means a lightweight!
