AWWWW, I just love this movie for bits. Me and my cousins ​​enjoy this movie a lot and I'm just such a big fan !!! I hope they will soon come with the TV series on DVD. Come to mention it, I didn't see the TV show for a long time. Such times! Where I come from Australia Chipmunk Adventure is only known to people in their late teens and adult years, which is a bit sad because the young children do not know what is missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are the ones I love the most boys / girls of Rock n'roll, Diamond Dolls and the song that is sure to make you cry my mother. <br /> <br /> This movie is sure to thrill both young and old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
