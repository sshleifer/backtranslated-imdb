George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as a monstrous general who led his rgiment to their death in the battle for Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots on," another picture of General Custer paints. In this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and mistakes are mainly due to his love of adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we first encounter as a convinced recruitment at West Point. Custer quickly distinguishes from other cadets as being a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow, this never seems to disturb Custer and only seems to confuse him as he really does not know how to get into such difficulties. Despite his poor standing, he may be trained and become an officer of the United States Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a union regiment to fight the Confederates. His campaign is successful, and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his treasure, Libby played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife who stays by her side and follows him into the border as he assumes the leadership of Cavaly's seventh regiment. Custer becomes an honorary man who strives to keep peace with the Indians. To prove his intentions, he entered into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of Sioux. When this treaty is threatened by a conspiracy to spread a false gold rumor found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as men's life under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates each scene where he appears. He successfully shows Custer as flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and fun, depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's portrayal of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had acted together in several other films, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not Custer and his wife. The other actors' portrayals of their characters really enhance Flynn and De Havilland's performances. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp is among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining. The reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. While it is not historically correct, it is very entertaining. The movie has a bit of everything. It has adventures, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a wide variety of audiences. Casting the characters is excellent and the actors provide credible performances that make you forget that it is largely based on fiction rather than facts. The reviewer especially thinks that the Indians were not shown to be the bad ones, but showed them just as protecting their holy land. <br /> <br />
