A beautiful film about the upcoming early silent cinema to China. SHADOW MAGIC combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between China's antiques and modern Western culture in the form of films. An amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I properly understood Mrs. Hus's comments at the Sundance Festival in 2000, this movie was produced as a US film co-financed by the Chinese government and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of movies like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feeling.
