I always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Better Betty" was no disappointment. I saw it on satellite on sad Sunday morning. Life has been stressful, and this movie made me laugh and see things we usually consider dire in a happy way. I wish she would make more movies like this and "Saving Grace." Brenda Blethyn is a big gal for us approaching 60 to see in action. She is sweet, beautiful and full of life without being plastic and false. Not many actresses are out there for us to relate to in a realistic but comical and / or serious way. Brenda - if you see this - continue with gems like this. We need more Mrs Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
