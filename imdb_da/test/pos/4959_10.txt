Okay, here's the deal. There is this American pilot who flies together and thinks of his own business when he is suddenly the head of evil, swept non-American fighter aircraft (they are Middle Eastern types, but enough to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley ) who continues to shoot him down Now this American pilot did nothing wrong, but the evil non-Americans didn't care about it, and before you know it, he was smashed into a foreign prison and sentenced to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what would normally be the case here is that the US military would blanket bomb a few nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. The types of these evil peace lovin were probably involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliation killers. As you can imagine, this does not need the pilot's family, and the evil foreign dictator has this alley, happy look at him. He'll make these Americans pay, oh yes! <br /> <br /> But he didn't count on Doug Masters, the captured pilots 16-year-old son. You see, Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive (which cannot be so long) and decides to fly into the evil, foreign land and get his father back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot ?? Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches a two-man air raid on foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now, you'd think this plan would be bound to fail, but you'd be wrong. Sure, the Middle Eastern types may be all veteran pilots, but Doug has a box up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and gets his now injured dad aboard the plane. Understandably, the evil, not quite the lie anymore, the dictator gets quite annoyed by these fakes and goes to heaven himself, bidding to shoot down Doug. But the young boy is listening to more rock music and blowing the villain out of the sky. Hurray! After Doug and Chappy shot down 90% of their air force, aliens send their last few planes in a pretty bad attempt to shoot Doug, but over time, a flight of American F16s pops up and scares them away. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. It was the first movie cassette I ever got, and until I was twenty, I was hoping that my father would be shot down over a foreign land so that I could save him. But he doesn't like flying so it didn't happen.
