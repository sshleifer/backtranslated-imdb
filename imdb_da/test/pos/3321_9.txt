A classic late 50 movie. The super-engineered headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not the best, but the direction, the cinematography and the younger cast's action are convincing. In a 50's sense (which I love). The look of the artificial (over-artsy?) Concurrent film "Far from Heaven" reflects just this kind of movie (and I suppose this movie may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hello, it's 1959!), But like a movie - wonderful! As a reflection of society, very interesting. And as a witness how Hollywood breaks away from the idealistic depiction of American sexual mores, fascinating.
