I'm sure the movie contains some gaps in the logic, but I was so excited about it that I really didn't care. The movie plays like a fun, light-hearted teen romp, combined with a Schwarzenegger-type action girl. It's packed with action, filled with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. Sean Astin is fun to see and I haven't seen Louis Gossett, Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He is a fine, underrated actor and I love to see him on the screen. I'm just wondering what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he can play the leading role in many of these direct-to-video flicks. Hopefully my assumption is wrong. Anyway, this is a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and I definitely suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
