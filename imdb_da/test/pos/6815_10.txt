I absolutely loved this movie ... So much feeling in that little time. I loved the beginning and how it completely throws you away. I love the story, and the deer is brought in. I know when I think of deer, I think of innocence and prosperity. Also in Psalm 42: 2 in the Bible, it says: "When the deer pants for the rivers, my soul commands you, God". It can even connect the last minute when the woman says it's okay. As if she knows she is walking with God. Maybe I think a lot about it. But sometimes it's interesting to see what's going on through people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and I had it on cable ... I immediately came to the computer to find out more about this movie and this amazing director! I really liked the music used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely sets the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
