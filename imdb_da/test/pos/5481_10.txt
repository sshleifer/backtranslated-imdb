I really love action / adventure movies and it's one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but it's the story that really counts. The best thing is possible, but we can tolerate those who are a little "over the top" as in the comic. The more turns, the more serious situations the hero is involved in and the more shocking moments in the movie; The more we action / adventure fans enjoy them. "In the Fire Line" has all the elements required for a rip-roaring action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a secret service agent near the pension whose one failing moment commits him. It has one of the most vicious, despicable, maniacal villains in John Malkovich, the type where you can't wait to see him, "get his decay". It has Rene Russo as 'love interest'. It has twists, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well paced by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score of the great Ennio Morricone. This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! Do not miss it!
