I watched this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it thoroughly. What a movie. I'm in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I want them to watch this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romantic movie or Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for most stores that sell both new and old movies, but haven't encountered anyone. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong that had a lot of old movies, but they didn't have it here. <br /> <br /> I also look at the successor Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of VHS or DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> Really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Many thanks.
