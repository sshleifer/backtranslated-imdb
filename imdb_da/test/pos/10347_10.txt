Recovery is an incredibly moving work that handles devastating effects of brain damage to not only the individual but the whole family. Without resorting to sermon or Hollywood sappy endings, Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The highest praise goes to David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I had supposed before I saw the drama that I would see some of their previous on-screen relationships in Blackpool blow through - but it never does. Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and I did not see any of them as an actor playing a role in the 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway's performance as the son just started his own life at the university fantastic - throughout the play, he shows a teenager's worn nature, thrown into the unwilling role of the house man, <br /> <br /> Sometimes almost every character in the drama is unsympathetic. As a viewer, I wanted to give them all a good chance to wake up to reality, stop moping and begin to adapt to the rotten, but very current change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself acting as one of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to something, including behavior that is quite unlike myself. It's the show's greatest strength - truth, without sugar coating, to force us all to think about what we could do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult but must-watch show. I hope it somehow manages to appear in the United States
