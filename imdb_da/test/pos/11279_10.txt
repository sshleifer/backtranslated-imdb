What this movie is not: Cool, Entertaining <br /> <br /> What this movie is: Visually interesting, Hard to get through, Intended <br /> <br /> I feel this movie sets the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of time when they experience a world without language. Like how animals should experience the world. You really don't see the movie as much as you witness a horrible series of events in what "feels" as real-time. Consistently it goes much longer than it is comfortable. This movie can be edited down to a 20 minute card and it would be a completely different movie. It would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. I've seen many cool movies, but I've never experienced such a movie here. If you can get your head in the right place for this, you really should appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what they did here. 10 out of 10
