ALICE is the kind of movie they made in their 30s and 40s. Never try to be an "event". Just want to entertain. And it does. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a clich√©, he did it right. The reason is alusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A guy dressed in white goes through a hole and Kiefer falls down one. As ALICE acts plotted about and vice versa, but with freshness you do not see in small films. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
