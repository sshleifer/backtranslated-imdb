I caught this movie show about the most unlikely success? , from a lower league, football team. The plot is thick and trains some great exciting twists. Intercut with shots and comments from the 70s. I was surprised by his crooked footy fun. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the outstanding Tim Healy as the confused (full) manager who bumbles with hanging on to something that will make his team win ...? I still remember bits like the stolen secret file that Don Revie (Super Leeds United and England manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else) has at Bostock United (the subfield men), as in his detailed report of their resistance, Bostock United , in this FA Cup final, just say "Sh-te". Many other footy gags long before the amazing feature-length "Mike Basset - Football Manager" with Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with, Gung ho English beats Germans, in football. Well moral. Although the score lines differ, by "Escape to Victory" (I still look forward when England scores) <br /> <br /> And the incredible eternal wear of following a really bad team in Micheal Palin's "Golden Gordon" from The series "Ripping Garns" (with Terry Jones) became the team called Bostonworth United if you are interested. <br /> <br /> I have seen high and low for a copy of Bostock's Cup self Nick Hancock's biography doesn t list it (probably someone-not mr hancocks error) <br /> <br /> Play it again or send me a copy - PLEASE ....
