I expected this to be like the others, trying to be scary - ending up looking stupid. Somewhere along the line, the authors must have realized it, and then the film, in a completely different direction, basically ignored the other films. This feels like another movie than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works far, and it does it best in the series.
