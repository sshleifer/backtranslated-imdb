A family travels through the Midwest. There are widow Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town called Hillsboro, where everyone seems more than a little strange. Their car breaks down and they have to stay. They quickly find a witch the coven has a spell over the city and is up to the evil. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that good. People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the hedges are at the end. There are also many loopholes in the end. The action is also pretty bad. Bateman and Capri are boring, and everyone else is about the same. Only old benefits Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. Still, this movie works. It renounces blood and gore (there are some, but this is PG) and needs to work with some very eerie visuals and atmosphere. The action hinders much of it, but it still works. Martin chews especially the landscape in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (kind of) like this movie, but it worked on me. It is a silent kind of horror that is not made any more. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
