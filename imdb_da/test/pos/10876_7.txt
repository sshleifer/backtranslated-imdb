I was actually happy when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But still, I felt I wanted more out of this game. For a James Bond game, it's pretty good, but not as good as his other games. It would be great if they could make a 360Remake for that. Maybe it would be much better then. It can just be cuz I'm in games like Resident Evil, Dead rising and those kind of games. So it could be better, but it was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! She was annoyingly dying all the time, and she couldn't run either. I recommend this game to those who like FPS games more than I do.7 / 10 STARS
