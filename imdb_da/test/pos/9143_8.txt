China White (1989) was Ronny Yus first international film. This U.K. / Holland / Hong Kong production was shot in English and was easily edited to the western audience. American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) were supposed to star in the movie, but because of past commitments were inaccessible, so another Western actor Steven Leigh took his place. More Hong Kong stars like Tommy Wong (playing a mute) and the always eerie William Ho seem as good as the director in an interesting cameo spot. The Chow brothers are in Holland to run the family business. They want the family business to be legitimate, but the other Asian gangs will not and will not move as a face-saving move to please "foreigners" and will continue to make money in the old fashion way. Others want to take their business to even a new layer of smuggling drugs and what not. After the Chow Elder is shot in cold blood, the brothers make their move toward any family that is not with them. Can the Chow family keep the families from killing each other or while the streets of Holland are flowing with innocence and gangster's blood? <br /> <br /> A heavily underrated movie. I was surprised at how good it was. I haven't seen the Hong Kong version. It would be a great treat for me. It is longer and has many more stars in Hong Kong Cinema involved in production. Too bad, this movie is not available on D.V.D. The video print I saw was washed out and the sound reproduction was not that great. <br /> <br /> Recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> factoid: This film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in the Netherlands.
