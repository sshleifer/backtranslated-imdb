Like most people, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far we have had Primeval and Rogue for the last 12 months, what can they do, it's new? Where both films were about action and violence, it is about fear and excitement. <br /> <br /> The performances are not Oscar-worthy when nothing happens, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much as torture. There are gaps in the plot, and maybe crocs doesn't really look like others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective, it's a stretch to say you want to enjoy this movie. It will make you feel as uncomfortable as the passion of Christ.
