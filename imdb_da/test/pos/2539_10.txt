Fernando Ramos Da Silva's violent death only eight years after the completion of this film, adds only to the grower BAbenco's strong message. The film is divided into two halves - the first in a Reformation, where a group of young people is abused and violated by the violent law enforcement and guardians. The other background is the city where they are limited instead of their own actions and morals, which include mugging, pimping and killing various characters entering their lives. The different sexes and sexual roles in the movie allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is teh character of Lalica, a transvestite who is the mother and lover of some of the children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute is both exciting and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story, and I recommend watching it with caution as there are some very unpleasant scenes to watch especially on the opening in twenty minutes. But while you see it, it's important to remember that this is not just a fictional story. The actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streets of Sao Paulo. They actually lived this life that was portrayed so vividly on the screen, and when Silva's case they died in police hands depicted so brutally. A documentary? A piece of fiction. It borders on both, but it certainly makes for heartbreaking material and is a movie that actually leaves you breathing and thinking long after seeing it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
