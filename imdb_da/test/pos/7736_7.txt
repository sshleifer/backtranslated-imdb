William Shakespeare probably did not believe Stephanos as a gay doctor, Antonio as a troubled wife or Caliban as a goatherd with a Trinitron, but Bardens had done worse for his good work over time and could even enjoy the lavish art of life it is his "Tempest" as reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-author Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect tired of designing Atlantic City casinos for the gracious Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering Alonso , is doing an affair with Philips wife Antonia (Gena Rowlands). Along with daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip flies to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a lovely Catholic girl struggling with the Philips celibacy lifestyle. Should a sudden storm come to an end in the end? <br /> <br /> Here's a thought of career in Cassevetes: How many other actors could make a movie so confused to something so great? A treasure trove of film critics for his previous work, often with his real wife Rowlands, he presents a central character that really suffers from his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and also make us enjoy him. It's not Prospero, but something nice and strange that makes a fantastic sea change all by itself. "It's here," he tells one of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." That it is. "Tempest" transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and finds some fine resonances in Philips' displaced life. "Show me the magic" he calls out for a storm-damaged skyscape and Mazursky's version, enhanced by Donald McAlpine's sterile filmography of purple seascapes and naturally tanned Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, in any way. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's history in any faithful way, is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to care for in this movie, and after meeting Sarandon in all her brilliance, it's hard to understand Philips' continuing concern for his wife, let alone his left-wing desire to make an unhappy "victim" to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot to love about "Tempest". Besides Cassavetes, there is Ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of the desire for the primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald is here very much the same teenaged mouse of privileged adolescence who would inspire John Hughes, but with an emotional depth, the later Hughes films did not fit in. Ringwald and Julia never received any Oscar attention, but they both would win the Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to awaken her on her island isolation with her TV rune of "Gunsmoke" in Greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want to balloon you with my bonny johnny," Kalibanos declares to be pushed aside, yet wins our sympathy anyway, especially after performing "New York, New York" with a goat grain. (When the "Tempest" hit the screen, Julia Broadway's toast was the leader in "Nine".) <br /> <br /> It's Mazursky's show, though it feels at times that Cassavete's running things with the line of improvisation readings and emotional breakdowns in widely. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha by telling her "I'm right in the midst of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as a gracious obsessive who seeks to crystallize his happiness by building a theater on his otherwise uninhabited island. /> <br /> For the sake of happiness, Gassman's rich performance as the other man who is as gracious as Julia, while telling a youth affair Philip: "Boys don't have half as much fund as we have. Be nervous ... and they love the back of an old sports car. "Despite being overblown and pretentious in spots, like so many art films," Tempest "is entertaining in its excesses and a trip similar to Shakespeare, although his dreams did not involve the smoking pot in a Go-Gos concert.
