I watched this movie through one of the actors' agents, and it certainly corresponds to a lot that comes out of Sth. Australia with regard to the overall * tone, * which is rightly dark and mood. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was excellent. Most young actors are * hammered up * and embarrassing, but not in this case. He was really very good. As for the * surrealism * thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this movie is pure 'weird'. It's a really strange movie, with strange places, history, strange things going on all the time. But "good" strange as opposed to "bad". It's hard to think of other movies like that, but it's not like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a hammer movie from the 60s. It certainly has an interesting mind working behind it. JINGO, my question is also about the title. Why modern love ?? Anyone? Also, jingo, what did you mean by "god Forsaken" when you talked about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
