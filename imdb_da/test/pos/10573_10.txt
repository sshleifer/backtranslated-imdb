This movie was amazing !!!! I didn't know the back story about it, so I needed to let it unfold in front of me on DVD. It had many twists but still kept the story fresh and exciting. The act of Elaine Cassidy was in one word Brilliant as well as Sally Hawkins. The story is rich in probable events as well as fresh ideas from the present. There is really something about Mrs Cassidy's eyes that leaves a mark. This film is a refreshing look at the way we look at the 'victorian times' and how we see that society. A very worthy watch.
