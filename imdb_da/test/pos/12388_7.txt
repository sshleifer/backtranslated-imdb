I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. While I watched the movie, I felt I had seen a movie with a similar story before ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I can't remember much of it. Of course, this is a lot more dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer sustain. After 20 years, all his life suffers from his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> See Emilio makeup lies exciting and fun but after a while you get tired of the same thing ... affair with a young girl should do something, but it doesn't. Despite this, the film is still fun, exciting and involved. Either way, you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone else catch him. I liked analogies, photography and the good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
