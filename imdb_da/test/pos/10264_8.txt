If you need the immediate buzz that only late 60s / early 70s Euro sex movies can give off, look no further because you've just stumbled across the mother! Subsequent TV director Schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) generally cannot be considered a classic of its kind, but it paves the way for many better-known titles from, for example. Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato for a run. Radley Metzger was certainly hip in this way before anyone else, when he picked up this wonderfully twisted little number for American distribution through his company Audubon. Beautiful filmography (favoring symmetrical compositions) can evoke screams of 'pretentiousness' from those who swear by scary skin flicks shot in a person's backyard. Hi, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss for this is a thrill of a movie with twists, so twisted that you might not even believe them when you actually experienced them on the screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as having gone to the dawn of Lucio Fulci's House by the House) has never looked more exquisite than she does here, subtly depicting the innocent (?) Scientist held hostage by the bad doctor Philippe Leroy (with the whole art house favorites to his name, you wonder if he has the good mood to mention this on his resume, since their originally violent "relationship" turns to S & M-tinged love story. Nothing is what seems in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. I for one was completely confused and enchanted by the way Schivazappa chose to propose oral sex in a scene (I will let you find one out for yourself ...) and Lassander's gauze boogie for an impossible groovy 60's tune should have iconic in a way similar to the picture of Sylvia Kristel lying in the basket chair in her EMMANUAL days. You may not know this movie yet, but believe me once you've seen it, you'll never forget it !!!
