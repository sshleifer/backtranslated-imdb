Many people remember Waco standoff long ago. What most probably have confused in their minds is the "Head of Culture" David Koresh and the images of the connection burning to the ground after a long stop. Many people believe that Koresh was a kind of madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being a children's master and was credited for the collapse and death of his successor. In addition, many people feel the cult committed suicide when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel Center and when the building burned. Most people feel that the cult was guilty of not accepting the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel the cult was brainwashed by Koresh and followed everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of-a-kind documentary shows just about it !! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced studies of the situation that arose. It is much more thorough and very detailed than what most people have received in the regular media. To many shockers, this documentary reveals that it was the ATF, the FBI, and the higher levels of the United States government, who were unjust, cruel, and deceitful, and not David Koresh and his supporters. What Korseh and Davidians did was just to protect their constitutional rights, and the higher forces violated and raped those rights. AFT had no reason to disturb the connection; It was the AFT that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above with unarmed men, women and children !! What is even more shocking is the FBI's actions when they entered Mount Carmel. See it for yourself, and you want to develop and renew perspective on the US government. There is infrared recording that clearly shows that the FBI shot with machine guns for men, women and children in the fiery connection. It will make your blood boil. It will make you really angry. It will make you wonder what kind of people are running this country. Finally, it will make you wonder what you are told about the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentary need not be purchased; it can be viewed for free on google video!
