The 08th MS team has two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina, Zeon officer and Shiro, Federal Forces' new pilot, meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episodes series (and a "movie") the two debate their love for each other while trying to get in touch with the war that surround them. It has a Romeo and Juliet romance and unmatched animation. By far one of the best to beat US shores. Get ready!
