I found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent filmmaker might face (something I never even believed in). The film managed to keep my interest all the time, and I actually shouted loudly more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I know nothing about the technology, but I was told the story even though it was well edited and flown smoothly. As a disclaimer, I contributed to this effort after giving music to the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this movie, and I could not tell you anything about Repo Man except I remembered to look back well since I am not really a sci-fi enemy. I enjoyed the comparisons movie made by punk rock file for punk rock music. My wife went with me to watch the movie and she didn't know anything about it before hand and we had a good time.
