'This is not a movie' works because it is so true in what it is trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you'll see a bit of yourself in the protagonist, Michael. Whether it is a man or a woman, we have all come to a point in our lives where we will look back and reconsider a situation or relationship. Did it really happen as we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out. But yet he is a sympathetic character, because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We wouldn't be in them otherwise. When the movie ends, I'm not sure if Michael has learned something new about himself or not. Our best goal of the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. She is the movie's soul and reminds us how there are always two sides to each story. I found Michael to be pompous, arrogant, and just plain clueless. That's exactly why I liked him. He is a true character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a past relationship, then this is a movie for you. Finally, it's a movie for everyone.
