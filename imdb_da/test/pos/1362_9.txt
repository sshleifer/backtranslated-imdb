I liked this, but I have friends who hated this. There is no sex, but there is very little nudity in any of the episodes - which is a good thing. Also, Keitaro has a toilet fixation that is explored in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated this so high myself ...? It is certainly not that I like naked cartoon girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (protagonist) is analogous to Johnny Bravo except instead of being an uncomfortable, muscular jock, Keitaro is a hyperactive geek. Or you can think of him as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. He's easier to take if you see the subtitle rather than double, but he'll grow on you in some way if you give him a chance. He's Goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. Boy meet girl, boy trying to win girl's heart despite being a dorky pervert, boy in some way against all odds. Typically, the girl does not understand that she likes Keitaro before he is massaged and / or pulled a spectacular stunt like engineering a modern operating system for a week or winning a race against a petrol-powered motorcycle using his bike. Episode 1 has a rich software tycoon. I think animating her breasts puts a big belly in the budget because she is the only woman who has this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessional. Most people who evaluate this negatively have probably never passed the first episode. Episode # 2 has the rich, young daughter who likes to tease. She's only 16, but it's legal age in Japan (and in some states in the US I can add). Her father is also a brutal yakuzza type who has a reputation for killing the guys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner mingled with a bad girlfriend. Except for the Keitaro, interference for the girl is running and being kissed by a guy, there is almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode - a sharp fall from the previous two. Nevertheless, Keitaro and the evil girl lover each other. Episode # 4, Keitaro has tried to impress on a first-rate swimming coach. Keitaro seems more "direct" about his intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and she's pretty direct in return ... Girl # 5 is a biker babe. She is probably the most heavy of the 6 (although not super-flowing as girl # 1) and 'raciest' in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily the most over-the-top in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against biker babe, but I think the manufacturers and the authors said, "It's just a cartoon! We can do it all!" The end in realism makes it a favorite for fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode # 6 introduces a new girl (it's works in animation), and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro as he tries to cope with the impossible time and resource constraints to get an OAV out of door before deadline. With regard to ecchi, this is also very tame, but there is plenty of humor. The end has all 5 extremely beautiful girls from the last team up to chase Keitaro, who slides away unnoticed, apparently for the purpose of grabbing him. Yes, the -MALSTE - happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (Ala Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (Ala Family Matters) ... All in all, there's no gap for this. You will either hate it or love it. If you're new to anime, you probably won't start with this. At the same time, if you can stand on characters such as Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that lean more towards sadness but have very sexual overtones, you should give it a shot.
