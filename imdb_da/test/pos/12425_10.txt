I first saw this on demand. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But it must always be my favorite movie! I mean, this movie has blood, gore, laugh and chills through the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I've seen "Monster Man" ever since I got it. Believe me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comment on the DVD is way fun. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" under the comment. Let's hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best movie released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
