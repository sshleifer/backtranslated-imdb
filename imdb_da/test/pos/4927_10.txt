CAUTION: Potential Spoilers Ahead! "Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it's still). And this movie captures everything I love about the show and puts it in full length. <br /> <br /> Beautifully animated by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB outsourced each "Tiny Toons" project and it was the best studio to handle the show), the movie starts at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity , the famous cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation) and their teenage tone companions learn from the masters of animated lunacy, Looney Tunes. After the final bell, the movie splits into five different plots. Buster engages Babs in a water gun battle that culminates with a blast dam and a tidal wave that sends Buster, Babs and Elmyra's dog Byron downriver on a toppled picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south. Plucky Duck talks to Hamton Pig and his family to let him bring them to HappyWorldLand, "The happiest place in the Western Hemisphere", but he has to put up with a monstrous drive and the threat of a chain-removing hitchhiker. Elmyra's cat Furball finally runs away, but she's not scared ... not when there are lots of "aminals" to play with at Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume uses her summer to chase her heartbeat, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel he is holding is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon creates a fortune telling on the Acme Acres Boardwalk ... and lets her guard down on her day off when Fowlmouth takes her to see the scream tab "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All these stories lines are sidesplittingly hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it does not make full use of the Tiny Toons roster - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the movie and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Still, they are excusable errors in an otherwise perfect movie. This movie is pretty rare today, as it is over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD for my knowledge, but I strongly suggest that you track it - anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, either classic or modern , need to watch this movie.
