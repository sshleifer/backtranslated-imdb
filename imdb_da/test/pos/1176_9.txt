I was totally surprised at how good this movie is, because when I first saw it, I was only mildly amused! However, I must say that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor did not get a bigger and better role! He was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> There is a good chemistry among all the major cast members, and Matthau has never been more fun. I am incredibly happy that this picture was made because we will see the Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek, the next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. The storylin is really quite simple, but comedy and the characters work really well, and I laughed heartily in this whole movie and I highly recommend it.
