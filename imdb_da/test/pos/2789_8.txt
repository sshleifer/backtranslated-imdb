L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and it is honest, realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or a drama, but more a piece of life film about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people sharing an apartment in Barcelona for a year. Beautifully photographed with a good soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring back a river of good memories. If you are young, learn by this example.
