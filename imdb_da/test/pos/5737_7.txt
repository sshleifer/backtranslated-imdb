Why has Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) brought his five college comrades to an eerily abandoned school building that used to serve the black sheep's children with wealth? That answer can only lie in a diary in his possession allegedly written by his dying father. What they come into contact with is actually a revived episode involving another group of six, five of whom are likely to encounter graphic fates in the hands of a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy) who emerged 20 some odd years ago. But as they seek a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as the horrifying moment of time the group runs for their lives, often in panic, as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a different bloody way . Will Ramón and any of his friends survive this night in horror or will ghosts forever repeat the same night as them before them? <br /> <br /> Stylish Spanish slasher has the professional brilliance and powerful shocking violence to match. Some witty exchanges between the characters. Stored in their dialogue are pop culture references to American horror movies that can annoy some viewers. A denied Naschy really loves the kiddies as he pleases them. A bloodthirsty madman who performs his violent acts with lovely. I found the high musical signals a little annoying, and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from past events in the movie as reminders to the audience. I do not think these tricks are necessarily necessary, but felt that the director wanted to communicate in depth with the viewer therefore the use of signals and flashbacks. A minor redirect to this movie's plot moves, and the camera follows the pace of the beat and how they respond to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this movie may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Time revelations and a killer who continue his work apparently from the grave. The twist seems a little scary and abrupt, but it may (or may not) work to consider how history plays out, why Ramon's father is shown among the ghosts that reintroduce the pigs events two decades earlier. I would say that this movie would probably not stop if it was reviewed in detail, but as a slasher flick it is a fresh breath.
