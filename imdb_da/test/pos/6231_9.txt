I really liked this one. I know it's violent with what is now clich√© plots and lots of abuse, but it was hell very fun. <br /> <br /> In our search for 70's and 80's fear cheese, we come across many flicks that are so bad they are good. We also have some that are so good, they suck, and then we have some that are so bad, they are just bad. It's certainly so bad, it's good. Some teenagers travel across an 'oasis' in the middle of the sky, a forgotten piece of junction America, and they decide to 'check it out'. They cross each line inappropriately until it is absurd and they pay for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't normally give a movie like this one 9, but the girls in this one are the type we miss from the 1970s: ditzy, scantily-clad and FIT. These are not the anorexic broads of today's terrible horror; They look great in booty shorts. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9 out of 10, kids.
