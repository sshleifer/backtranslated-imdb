A grumpy old baron, happily unmarried, decides to send to his three adult illegitimate children and give them a home in his mansion. To his surprise, he finds himself tied up with his uninhibited American daughter. Can he find satisfaction in his new role as THE BIBELOR FATHER? <br /> <br /> This 1931 movie, which provides robust performance, marked the arrival of MGM by Elder Sir C. Aubrey Smith, who would soon be one of Hollywood's most valuable character actors. With his large chopped nose and paddle blades, Sir Aubrey looked every inch the part of the Duke or General or statesman he would play so often. The renowned head of British society in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey, would also master the game of Criquet in Southern California. He would remain highly sought after in studies throughout the city, right up to his death in 1948. <br /> <br /> The movie's top star is Marion Davies. Best remembered today as her master William Randolph Hearst & Chatelaine of Hearst Castle, the most amazing residence on the west coast, she was actually a very talented and beautiful comedienne. For a couple of years, Hearst tried to make her the Queen of MGM (with her own production company and a large bungalow changing room), but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and he eventually moved her to Warner Bros. Here, Miss Davies gets a chance to joke and clown and her scenes with Sir Aubrey are entertaining. <br /> <br /> Her love is played by Ralph Forbes, a beautiful young British actor who just started to find great movies (TRAIL OF 98) as the silent days ended. He had all the qualities of a big star, but unfortunately it was not. Celebrity would come to Ray Milland, here's one of his first screen appearances. Halliwell Hobbes & Doris Lloyd also seem to be an advantage.
