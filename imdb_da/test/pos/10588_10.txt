The movie was amazing. If you are a fan of Bams' cky videos, jackass or his show Viva la Bam, you can't help but like it. I have a few friends who are not fans who enjoy it, and others who thought it wasn't that big. Those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they really didn't understand the raw humor, I personally think the movie was so fun. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in Bam's hometown, which contains many of his regularly visited sites. Cast off consists of all his friends and cky friends, and also includes some great name pro skateboarders too. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with music from HIM. In my opinion, Haggard has all that. A great plot, character, you will never see anywhere else. Lots of humor good music and a throw that was dedicated to the project.
