Don't quite know why some people complain about this movie is not a comedy and at the same time is too unrealistic. If it had been realistic, there would certainly not have been much comedy. I also don't think a comedy should make you laugh loudly 20 times. There was very subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In fact, many people whose facial expressions do not change much, so Kim Frank holds his, was quite okay. The ending was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a light hearted movie with a good feeling. I liked it. Loved it, actually. One serious part was that Krueger was going to Schwedt, and I'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there. Shows how he was when he came back, it clearly indicated.
