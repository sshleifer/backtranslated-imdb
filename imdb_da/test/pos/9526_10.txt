I think together, all reviewers have taken this movie really well. I've seen it many, many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth like I did the first time. My emotional response to this movie never seems to fade. The final scene brings me determined to tears, but it also makes the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And like the kind gentleman. Something else happens with that character. The generous provider and solves problems. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect father to run to and make us feel safe. I do not know how the film does, but it touches a lot of English deep inside that has long gone from our daily experience, yet we all recognize and long for again.
