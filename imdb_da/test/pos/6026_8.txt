I came to The Last Stop one day in a video store and they sold it for only $ 2. I decided to try it and bought it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about several people who are all trapped in a cabin somewhere because of a raging snowstorm. There is a police officer, Nancy, his ex girlfriend, two brothers who have just come to jail, an elderly man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the cottages and their resumed son who never speaks. Suddenly, someone has been found to be murdered and there is a bag full of cash. Everyone is a suspect. The Last Stop is a pretty good thriller, I would give it 8/10
