This movie is great, it has the same low budget first movie experience of 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but has the style of 'Memento' (also by Writer / Director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'Memento' prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is best when he writes and manages. Don't be discouraged by the low budget look and acting, or even the movie's short length, and just watch it!
