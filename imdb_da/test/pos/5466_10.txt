Excellent story with supperb works by all castes. The heat and insight into who Joad represents moved out of the screen and into the heart of this seer. Mother Madalyn's frustration and retention in her attempt to make her work for her last spirit was also done with the excellence of Barbara Hershey. Joining the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew through the story with a breathable crescendo in the final scene.
