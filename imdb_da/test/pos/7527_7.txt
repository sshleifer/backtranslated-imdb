And so was born the most amorous skunk ever to grace the silver screen. While the plot has an abused cat painting as a skunk and accidentally attracts Pepe Le Pew (called Henry here), Pepe probably steals the show. Without a doubt, Chuck Jones acknowledged that this love-seeking member of the genus Mephitis had the special thing that was needed to be a star in itself, and then threw Pepe in "For Scent-imental reasons" four years later and established PLP's lasting presence on screens everywhere. So, while "Odor-Able Kitty" might be a placeholder otherwise, I try to imagine seeing it for the first time in 1945. Could anyone have guessed that this support character would soon be included in the series of bugs, daffy , porky and the rest? Whether anyone did, Pepe remains one of the most sympathetic signs of this day. I am!
