Despite a few acceptable adjustments to the books' main themes, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT was not true for Anne Rice's complicated storytelling. The deep layers that build up all the characters were spread to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the major events in the film seemed skewed and uneven. <br /> <br /> There were, however, a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the movie caught the influence that Lestat (including vampires) had on the public, especially young girls. The film also did a pretty good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history, which the vampires were proud of. The scenes of sensuality were also satisfactorily atmospheric. <br/> <br /> The play in the Queen's Queen was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, but it only shows when the play is best (not very often). The signs are nothing compared to those established in the INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of FROST OF ALL HOME which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned book had it and much more. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't give everything that seems to be. The effects are dull and very disappointing. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not how I depicted them in the book, and I think many of them were not even taken from history. There are only a few areas of connection near the beginning and the middle of the movie, but it breaks up pretty nicely and gives the viewer a complete story (if they hadn't read the book). Somethings that I feel the movie needed include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; although I had no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is a better way. The landscape was dull and unclear, which is important in a story that moves quite often. <br /> <br /> Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing, yet somewhat satisfying, adaptation to the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. I would recommend this movie to people who have seen INTERVIEW or have read the books so they can get their opinion on the adaptation.
