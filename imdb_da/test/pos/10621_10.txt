Yes, I felt I had been cleaned after first seeing it. But not until the next day I began to see the true shine of this creation. I will not repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the movie, but there is a new area I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in it student pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflects her cruelty and response to an unsatisfactory performance. I have to disagree See the scene again. Huppert has moved to tears when she looks at her studying on stage. The student is an expressive girl (crying and vocalizing her fear) - just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the movie after the girl is hurt when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly disturbed, says "We gave up everything so she could study the piano" and Huppert immediately snaps "You think she gave up everything, not you." <br /> <br /> So it was my thinking Huppert simply saved this young, expressive student from his own destiny. She did not want the girl to end up as HERE, suppressed and hardened, condemned to a life of contemplation ... gradually killing the soul of the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on stage many years ago before things got bad. Maybe she wanted her to have fled when she was age. Does she interfere with the student's life or just release her? <br /> <br /> For me, this realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this movie. Brilliant.
