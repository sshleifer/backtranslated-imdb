I have to admit that I am hurting my voice about this movie, but I have strong reasons when I know some of the true stories that were given Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel, on which this is based, is from an era where real names cannot be used. In a way, this movie is all smoke and mirrors. Although released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is her most brilliant in this movie as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman trying to act on her beauty to get a rich man. Today it is a gold digger, but in this social age she is desirable and the kind of woman who does all the men wants her, and all the old snooty community types talk about her and avoid her while they want them to be. Ingrid is at her best and plays this role well. <br/> <br /> Some sympathy for Ingrid's character has been raised in the New Orleans section of this movie as she manages to get a decent delayed grave for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement of her relatives to get to leave New Orleans. The snooty family of relatives who are so scandalized by her that they will do almost everything she asks to get her to leave town. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this movie, though he already seems aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor / Gambler. He pulls it well considering the disability that he seemed older than he was due to his real life chain of smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as an entertaining actress in this movie. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was overstated in many ways for his role, but is the only comical relief in the movie and does well. <br /> <br /> As the movie moves to Saratoga, it shows exactly how important Saratoga was in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman goes to Saratoge to get some of the "sulfur" water that everyone saw so healthy. When she drinks some, she forces herself not to make a face and comment on how good it is and to have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is the railway battle that really originated on the railway line in Tunnel, New York - which is the actual Saratoga Trunk where the movie title is derived. This fight actually took place in 1869 between agents of Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869, connecting coalland and east coast. The references to it are the whole movie is very real. There are even some dialogues describing Carnagie as a "Scot," although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the story of the fight. The railway and rail tunnel in Tunnel, New York (postcode 13848) still exists, even though the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It's still part of a key-line this year, after this happened. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the movie while driving on the train into the tunnel is right, it's still "mighty beautiful country".
