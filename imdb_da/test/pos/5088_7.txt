Following on from the exclusive film program on complicated relations in some European courts, last night's Schloss theater was shown "Anna Boleyn", a film directed by the great teutonic film director Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film portrays the horrible story of the British King Henry VIII's Queen Consort. She was executed by her husband (not exactly, the king ordered the fines to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first acting star in the early years and Mr. Emil Janning, Germany's coolest actor in the silent era. Both play their characters appropriately; The Lady Gate as an innocent aristocrat who is gradually becoming interested in the power that the court offers her and Mr Jannings as the unscrupulous, moody and female British monarch, a sign that is very well suited to this German actor, who appropriately suits of the extravagance and excessive personality character itself. <br /> <br /> In the early movie period, Mr. Lubitsch was known for his excellent costume films, huge productions with big budgets ("Anna Boleyn" costing about 8 million characters, a fortune even for this German counter) takes great care in magnificent decors that can be seen during the crown process of the Westminster Abbey scene employing 4,000 extras (idle Germans from that time were used, causing revolutionary workers to create a wealth when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during the shooting ). <br /> <br /> In addition to the play, one of the most important aspects of this and any movie by Mr Lubitsch, even in his epic period, is the complex relationship between the protagonists. We experience a game of different interests, dual meanings and the complicated art of flirting, but what is dealt with easily ends first in tragedy. The significance of these historical facts has been brought in an effective way, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I must temporarily take my vacation because this German Count must take care that one of his fat and rich heirs does not lose her head to this teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
