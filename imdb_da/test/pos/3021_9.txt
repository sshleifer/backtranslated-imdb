A bursting and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use his therapy at Carl Stargher (Vincent D ' Ofornio), a serial killer who (using strange and horrible torture tactics) exists in a coma of feds. What Novak wants in return from Deane is where Starher's last victim is and if she lives. When Deane enters Stargher's mind, which has the look and feel of a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. Deane sees a number of countless people ranging from Carl as a young (a sweet Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the shaving gossip. I will not give the end, but the film is all the way to the dynamite performances, Howard Shores crazy musical score and direction (by Tarsem, showing here he can lead).
