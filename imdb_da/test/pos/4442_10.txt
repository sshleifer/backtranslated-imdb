Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way many of them presented a bucket of gore leads to him who earned the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While not a torture a duckling was made before Fulci became known among gorehounds, and that's not all that gory; It is definitely a gritty and ugly little thriller, and for my money - the best movie Fulci has ever made! Don't torture a duck really is head and shoulders over a lot of Giallo genre in terms of production values ​​and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is amazing. The plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have begun to turn up. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after the police judge an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to begin investigating the murders alone. Martelli soon encounters various suspects, including a sexy young lady named Patricia, a creepy priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax images and foams. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not contain lots of gore, it has two of the Fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it. The nastiest implies that a woman is brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a rock and hitting a number of stones on his way down may change some stomachs. Don't Torture a Duckling Feature an absolutely fantastic Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (a personal favorite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and gets to bend her actress muscles more than in many later movies. Tomas Millian is excellent as usual, while the rest of the casting is great by people like Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The cinematography on the screen is amazing, and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts great care and effort into every scene. The story slowly plays out, and it is always interesting, as Fulci never allows the movie to win too much from the central plot line. There is not much mystery about the murderer's identity; But Fulci almost keeps us guessing right up to the end and not torturing a duck climbing high. All in all, it's a shame that Fulci doesn't make more movies like this. Do not torture a duck is his out and out best work, and I insist that all Giallo fans see it!
