a very surprisingly underrated movie. very realistic. and authentic. with great dialogue. Being Italian, I can certainly relate to the situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was fantastic. as a crazy mob cowboy type, and pesci and Vincent were also good. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think the director Ralph devito was on his way to good things, but was cut too early, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was great. it deserved more airplay and recognition. It was a sleeping movie. large. very good. It had really good authenticity. It was well done.
