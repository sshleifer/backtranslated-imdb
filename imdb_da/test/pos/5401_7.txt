The new review says that Sigourney Weaver's character is tense and frustrated, and later she could be the sister of MTM's character in Ordinary People. What do you say? No way. This lady was quirky from the start. Nothing like MTM in ordinary people. Sorry. NEWS continues to say that Sigourney Weaver Weaver Sandy Travis and Jeff Denmark's Ben Travis are 40-year-olds, "children of the 60s". Mrs. Weaver is going to dance a jig. I think at the time she made Imaginary Heroes, she was actually 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NEW perception corrections aside, this was a pretty good movie when it was made by such a young. Of course, Sigourney Weaver thought so, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man who played Tim was excellent. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments I could make about the script. Thus, I never really feel good about why Sandy Travis missed her son. Her kind of disconnected behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but such behavior persisted throughout the film I felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with Tim, and where he really came from and other unresolved issues than from every sorrow for her eldest son. Ben's grief was much clearer. So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did his mother think so too? Still a very reliable movie. What becomes clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women of a certain age, rather that what is required is an instructor like this who is so clearly in love with an elderly woman (Mrs Weaver) and Almost making his movie is a tribute to her. Kind of an anti-Woody Allen.
