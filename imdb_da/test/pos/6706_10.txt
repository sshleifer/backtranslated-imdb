Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi Horror to get out in the eighties. The effects (made by ILM) are still in line with today's standards. The actors are mostly British and are British seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was panned by the critics and unfortunately did not perform well in the cashier office on both sides of the Atlantic. Tobe Hooper owed the promotional work done before the release as the main reason for the low rates. But for whatever reason, it does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent movie with a great cast and successful plot. <br /> <br /> Not to be overstated.
