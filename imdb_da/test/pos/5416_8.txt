It's a shame that by achieving a limited rating, perhaps the audience who would find this movie, the most useful one, will probably not see. <br /> <br /> Imaginary Heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brother's suicide. Not of course the most original story in the world, but it takes a lot of time to humanize their parents, the "imaginary heroes" who failed in the eyes of their sons. For teens, who tend to take responsibility for their failure on their parents, but still refuse to accept real responsibility alone, the film sends a strong message that we eventually have all our own problems we have to deal with and that we Everyone does our own way. <br /> <br /> However, unlike other films that tend to encourage youth independence, this solves the problems between parents and children, and they become a stronger entity for it. The fact that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable but not overlooked later in the film, and the responsibility of all parties to the tragedy is thoroughly explained. <br /> <br /> Although the subject has been covered before, it has nothing, I have been covered quite like this - the film pulls very small beats. Now why this earned it an R-rating is confusing - you are unlikely to get over to a teenager in this era without being realistic, yet giving realism limits the very audience. <br /> <br /> Where my junior high school class has been shown this movie, two suicides may have been prevented. In this case, the censors seem to have performed extremely poor assessment. <br/> <br /> 8/10
