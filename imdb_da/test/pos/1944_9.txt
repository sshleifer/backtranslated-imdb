I've seen this movie three times. Going back to the VCRs, in the 1980s and again on The Encor channel last night (February 11, 2010). Based on a true story that I remember being in the news in the early 1980s, I have decided that I find it disturbing to ever see. But it's hard to look away from a car accident. The most eerie character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves little brother. <br /> <br /> (The story this movie was based on is everywhere on the Internet - just Google it. It's about Anthony Jacques Broussard, who murdered Marcy Conrad in Milpitas in California in 1981.) The characters depict Generation X pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who grows a conscience. <br /> <br /> Old hippies did a good job of generating that generation. <br /> <br /> For such a young child, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent as the serial killer in creative character. In fact, he went to Yale and wrote screen shots as well as directed. His working abilities in this movie were amazing. Just as he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and tearing up the tombs, I gave me tremors. It gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it's still the most degenerate movie I've seen to date. <br /> <br /> Apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make a puke. This tension kill almost makes the Manson murders pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover got a little too much for character. He settled on David Lettermen to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head. Apparently, Glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character. <br /> <br /> Also fight the good fight for the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
