Wolfgang Peterson leads this thriller, which has Clint Eastwood, who plays Secrect Service Agent Frank Horrigan, matching wits with a smart psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game involving Presidential protection. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) keeps in touch with Horrigan, who plagues the agent with dissuasive remarks about his abilities as well as the secret service's protection of the presidents of the past. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan grounded; But he is strong in stopping Leary from performing his murder threats. Very good FX and fast pace maintain the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are excellent. Russo has a way to get your attention. Rounding off this strong cast is: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
