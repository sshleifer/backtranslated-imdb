Although this film destroyed director and writer Michael Cimino's career and bankrupt United Artists, it still stands as one of the best movies all the time. There are many reasons to reject this movie prematurely. Among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal mistreatment of animals on the set list, continues and continues. And yet it remains a movie that catches something. It is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on an equal footing with Strindberg - its moments last as long as they may not have actually been stupid for good cinematic timing. It feels right in its moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness). This movie is to be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling.
