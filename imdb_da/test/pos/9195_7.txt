Isabel has just left prison. She is determined not to return, but life is difficult for ex-convicted, especially if they are homeless as Isabel. When she finds the one who was her boyfriend Rufo, she can see hope, but Rufo is now not just a junkie but also an AIDS disease. This will not make Isabel surrender, because if there is a will, there is a way and she must fight for her future, having normal life, with a house and a family. A very hard and moving film that has passed ignorant of most Spanish cinemas is good actors, and the story is very touching, perhaps a better treatment of secondary characters would have made the movie better, but it is really good. I highly recommend watching it, but be aware that this is not a Disney happy movie, it's hard and dramatic.
