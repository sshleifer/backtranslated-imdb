Another great animation from Disney. Sequels are not always so big and tend to follow the same plot as the original. The son of Tramp is trying to enjoy the world outside the home and family he knows and teaches where he actually belongs. Being a junkyard dog is not for everyone who is dog it is, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voice of the various characters was excellent and provided by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milan and Mickey Rooney. Entertaining and a well-made family movie.
