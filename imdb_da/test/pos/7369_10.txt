This movie is about a group of four friends who destroy a car while driving. They build a campfire to get through the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. To tell if it would ruin the movie, rent and enjoy it !! <br /> <br /> I would say it starts a little slower, but every story gets better and better. This movie comes from some of today's hottest actors Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are big names stars, not just the right ones !! Make rental or purchase it just as fast !! This movie is amazing !!
