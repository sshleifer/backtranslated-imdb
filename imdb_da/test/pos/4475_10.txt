What an incredible story and what a beautiful movie! Hat is off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerful. I looked at what was fascinated, almost breathtaking, as history evolved to its inexorable end. The performance of this movie was almost flawless: simple and clean, it plays with our hearts and leads us to understand the strange platonic absolute possession between two creatures that are not meant to be part of each other's world. Both are capable of love, but ironically, the more "developed" one becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the other freedom. It is one of the most fascinating and exciting views of the many forms of love and an incredible study of how repressive and devastating human love can be sometimes. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind would link this story to any kind of bestiality.
