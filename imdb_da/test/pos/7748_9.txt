I thought this movie was pretty good. It was at TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three o'clock at night one night, and the striking humor kept me up to five. Kelly performs beautifully in this role, especially with grandmother (whose twigs have almost made me laugh at my seat). The main actress was okay, but his father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept the humor that came. If you like a good offbeat, older movie, I'd recommend it. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect leading actor for many of the early musicals, and I believe in this role he oozes his charisma. One disadvantage is that the dance scenes become a bit lengthy, but if you can get through them, you are in the clear.
