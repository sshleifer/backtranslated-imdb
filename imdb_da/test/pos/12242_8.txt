Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen comments on a movie that I disagree with more than the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical views of this movie. As an educational film, I strongly believe it because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not see movies to learn; we generally look at entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the end is downbeat and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network manager introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt) to study for the air news anchor position. Tom immediately praises people with humility. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for its airline, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news stories in and out. <br /> <br /> The network leader wants Grunnick on the air, and Jane argues, Grunnick is not clear, he does not know the news. They don't listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane Altman contacts information on newsletters and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick talks. We see the sharp contrast between Altman's / Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's when Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear to make it understandable, sympathetic and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance for air, and the network experts demand that he seek out coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (demanding) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified but agrees reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Grunnick coaches Altman and is thrilled to note hundreds of Altman's flaws in appearance, sound and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things until he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him causes Altman to have a panic sweat attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is in the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns before being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt at a romance with Jane Craig because she finds out Altman that Grunnick sometimes falls into circumstances to make people like him. This beats her off him. This sends the message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message of making people like you is the most important skill in a job, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the silly down of television news, and how Grunnick represents a beautiful but stupid guy or all style, but no matter. The opposite is true, Grunnick possesses skills and very complex intellect to make people like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he looks and sounds when he is on camera (he coaches Altman to put a word in each sentence). Grunnick's mistake, which cost him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be sympathetic and will fake a situation. Many people call Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman, played by Brookes, is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the scene "Flop Sweat" shows that his mind could not cope with the complexity Grunnick handles when he is in the air. Altman is angry with this fact that he knew the news, and Grunnick succeeded more in getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the television news industry. The concept of winning friends is the most important skill in a job, of course, is not popular, but my experience shows that it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educationally, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.
