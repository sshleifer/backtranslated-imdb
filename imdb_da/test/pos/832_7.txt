This movie is good in its genre, and that genre is obviously a small / average budget. It appears that Van Damme delivers much better performances when he has a good director who leads him. There is your basic bar brawl, spawn scene and mostly a lot of gun battles. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How is this guy not a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I do not know. Director Isaac Florentine has made a movie with Scott Adkins previously called Special Forces (2003), which has some incredible martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2. Check out this guy and make a sound, this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about movies? It is Van Damme who draws a glimpse of some of his recent work. No Oscars here for sure, but you already knew that. But the less it has a nice little town feel, and I could find worse ways to spend my time. So I give this a solid 7 out of 10 in its genre.
