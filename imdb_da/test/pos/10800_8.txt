Not a bad movie, but could have been done without a 10-year-old boy's full frontal nudity in one of the open scenes. This movie has excellent dialogue; which is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act in contrast to American actors who let CGI, stunts and special effects do everything for them. This movie is just good old-fashioned play. Gerarde DePardieux did an excellent job as always. Costumes and landscapes are accurate over time. My only complaint is that they should have called the English words over French instead of using subtitles; It may just be because I hate to read subtitles.
