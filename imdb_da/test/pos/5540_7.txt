Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has wanted her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shot that continues to pester Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very eighties, but it just adds to the fun. A nice little flick, but not for every taste.
