DEATH HAND DESCRIPTION greatly sets a ten on a scale from one to another - by no means, to John Woo's masterful direction along with Kat's amazing filmography: some of the distinct snaps alone are worth the price of a rental; There are moments when this borders on becoming an art house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung provide the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. The ten are particularly good as the worst of the bad. It's a role, conversely, that I don't think I've ever seen before (Tien usually played a hero, and in fact with his mustache I didn't even recognize him first). Sammo's greasy "buck teeth" only make an already invulnerable sign to seem even more erroneous; that he also seems to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less sympathetic - in a villain you love to hate kind. His choreography of the battle scenes all the time is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears shortly early and delayed as a blacksmith, and I think I actually glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead is nothing short of magnificent.
