I watched this movie at 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Beagle is only in a few short flashbacks. Everything is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was divorced in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin had already been prepared. and he wondered if he should finish the book. <br /> <br /> Scripture is based on Randal Keynes book Annie's box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but also includes sex scenes - though the participants are married, both on and off screen. Not too exciting, not much science, but a well-made movie that is comfortable to watch and push the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic weepie, actually. I suppose you can be an agnostic, free-thinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotionally romantic as well as an excellent father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself say or wonder if he "killed God", but the viewer is able to doubt it. What is undoubtedly in view of the deadly struggle for survival and the Web of Engagement at the Engbank (known before Darwin and completely uncontrolled) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of ​​some kind of supply god who loves "his" creatures is untenable. <br /> <br /> I really can't see many Americans protesting against it much. Some may have issues with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing about the movie, or with the fact that Bettany doesn't have horns, a tail and a pitchfork.
