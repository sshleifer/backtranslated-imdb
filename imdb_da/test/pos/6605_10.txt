Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys are a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California as we know it day. With their low pivotal style, they initiated a Larry Bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a few mistakes. After the Dogtown articles were featured in a reintroduced Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was renewed, and the members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot Jeff Ho and seemed to be on summer vacation the rest of their lives by joining other skateboarding teams that could afford to pay them as movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team composed of Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (Photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki's only female) , Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still good and surfing / skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, earned time for drug-related charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes in this documentary are kind of read between the lines, but if there was a clear theme it would be that even children can spark turns. Other themes may include extensive celebrations in one's past that can lead to an unchanging future, and by planning and being careful about one's assets, a very rewarding future may be present. Other works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced or directed. Most with a common theme for surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades and Lord of Dogtown. He also made films with a theme growing up in America as a teenager, movies like: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America and the 70s: The decade that changed television. <br /> <br /> Topics: The topics in Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team with the exception of Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in interviews. Other topics were people who grew up in the 70s and read the Dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area but not on the team were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: Editing this movie was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the topics that spoke, so the audience could see who was talking and getting a sense of character, but would immediately push to archive movies that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could explain the feelings of the subjects better, as Jay Adams' unfortunate life was the subject of talk, the song Old Man was played by Neil Young, causing many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator of the movie and he explained the transition throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surf team was put together to create the skateboarding team, to all Z-boys who left the team to join other skate companies or set up their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way. The movie from the speeches that were spoken was all in black and white and all archived images of Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course, the footage from the 70s was grainy, but it only reinforced the film. The interviewers were largely shot in the same area as it seems, but everyone was outside. All the recordings were very well controlled even the archive films, which I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - Designed by Aerosmith "Toys in the ceiling" - Designed by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - Performed by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses "and" Whipped Cream "- marked by Herb Alpert" In The Void "and" Paranoid "- performed by Black Sabbath" Godzilla "- Blue Oyster Cult" Aladdin Sane "and" Rebel Rebel "- David Bowie" Fastcars "- The Buzzcocks "Gut Feeling" - Devo "I Give You Money" - Peter Frampton "Funk 49" - James Gang "Ezy Rider" and "Foxy Lady" and "Freedom" and "Bold as Love" - ​​Jimi Hendrix "Surf Surfing" Jan and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "Hot on for Nowhere" - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - The Sneaker Pimps "Surfrider" - The Lively One's "Cat Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse" and "Wang Dang Sweet Poontang Ted Nugent "us and them" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - The Pretenders "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I want to be your dog" and "Gimme Danger" - Stooges "Children of Revolution" - T -Rex "Bad Reputa - T hin Lizzy "Disco Inferno" - The Tramps "Hannah" - Rob Trower "Rocky Mountain Way" - Joe Walsh "Old Man" - Neil Young "La Grange" - ZZ Top <br /> <br /> The music in the movie makes the movie . Each of these songs contributes to what the topics say and evokes emotions that would not have been reminded otherwise.
