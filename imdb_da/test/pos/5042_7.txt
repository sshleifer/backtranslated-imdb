The title of the film seems quite appropriate in relation to the person's protagonist, Fanda. He is an elderly man who lives in the late autumn of his life, but adorns himself as an anniversary schoolgirl who has just entered a spring land. The free-fall of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. His wife supports this idea when she notices, "Fanda laughs at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously; He has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life and the pursuit of living life to the full are the philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. He is not one to exist, but must live for every day and every moment, for tomorrow it is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to give a strong comment on living as if there is no tomorrow, let alone dead. For many people, life takes too much and, consequently, lacks the actual living part of life. Fanda's wife for example; She is so worried about preparing for death, not in any religiously connotative way, but in an overly practical and even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just feel good. Her humanity seems to have turned into zombie auto-pilot mode. Fanda, on the contrary, may be too blithe and absent for his own good. He needs a person like his wife, Emilie, to help balance him. <br /> <br /> It is as if Fanda possesses an invincible spirit in a child like a child trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as the adventurous type; He pretends to be people, he is not for gain, wasting money, factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. Deep down, however, he is a kind and gentle old man who wants to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two separate each other quite nicely, though none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until the metaphorical chance of death: meaning, their divorce. It is during this court scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his mistakes, yet is drawn to continue loving him despite his insane behavior. At this moment of forgiving him, Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and making an internal commitment to make her happy. <br /> <br /> However, ironically, after making this commitment, he becomes what his wife later calls "a living body". The life blood in him runs away as he becomes more like her zombie goes through the daily movements. He does not seem to live longer, but exists. For example, he gives up his zany pranks, does not waste money, ceases to smoke because of his wife (not his health), and overall he welcomes whatever she wants from him. Successfully, he changes because of wanting to do her well. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to disappear slowly. Realizing that her husband is not the one he used to be, there is a part of Emilie who misses the old Fanda. She misses her husband's aloofness and the struggles they used to have because it was in those moments that they really lived, not just simply existing. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to cross a certain message here; True and loving relationships will not always be easy or comfortable, but often victims and perseverance will wade through the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any time is what reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened by death, is it literally or figuratively? People watch out for their ungrateful slumber and are awakened to begin living life to the fullest. It is as if they are afraid that they will never live again, so they better utilize it while they have it. Fanda and Emilie were married 44 years of fighting along the way, but it was only until they were both threatened by the possibility of death-like separation that they began to show their true colors. As the old maxim goes, "Love does not know its own depth for the separation of the hour." Both begin to see what matters most in life, and they are the people they meet along the way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.
