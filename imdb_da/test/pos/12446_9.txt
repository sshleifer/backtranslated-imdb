I did too. When I first saw the band, I immediately rejected them without listening to the music. So one day, out of sheer curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. hold on to your lunch kids, this won't be beautiful! The video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, watch some of the promo videos and meet the band ... even though I still can't know how to wear those masks all the time! A must for all fans of the band and fans of alternative music in general
