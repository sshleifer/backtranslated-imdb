"Unconditional love" starts with great promise. As described by P.J. Hogan works the film fine until the last third of the film when it falls flat on the face. The play Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote a myriad of options that fizzle at the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film had great hopes that it could play differently. The reality is that this is a movie that looks in different directions in how to bring it to a decision that ultimately fails. Don't make me wrong, the movie is incredibly appealing and will revive with a lot of its audience. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The hugely talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the movie that everything is not good in her marriage. Ms Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better, even though she does not help what the authors have in her movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable in delivering. His role as the late Victor Fox's lover is well-written, ie. until Dirk is tempted to come to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It's bizarre and it counts all logic rules. Dirk is unable to hurt a fly, let alone chase a killer by Grace and her sister-in-law, the incredible fun Maudey. As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman Maudey is one of the best things in the movie. She is brash and tells it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in movies these days, has nothing to do with the picture; he is completely wasted. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him in the beginning and at the end of the movie, and his Max doesn't make sense. He seems to have changed his life and marriage, only to return to Grace without any explanation, all forgiven. <br /> <br /> The English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity as a hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghostly gentle song. Julie Andrews makes a fun contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the TV show hosting Sally Jesse Raphael is off and doesn't add anything to the movie. The best thing is to hear Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Mrs Bates is the best excuse to stay until the end.
