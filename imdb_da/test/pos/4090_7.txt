I watched the movie Lost Horizons 1973 and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree with the move had many opportunities for improvement, but unlike all those seeking the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best actor, I searched for something a little different and this movie gave it to me. I didn't see this movie as a critic, but as a person looking for a little hope, a little mockery, a little release from everyday life, and that's what I got. You can be critical of acting song and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to a movie. I'm looking for a little release from my daily life, a little time where I can sit back and imagine a better life where people love someone else and help someone else. It's a shame we can't enjoy a movie for what it tells us and stop picking it apart as an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. It can be very simplified, but it would not be great.
