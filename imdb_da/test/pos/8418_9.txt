I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager living in the 21st century, and it is obvious that I am not much into Bollywood, let alone Marathi movies. But when I looked at Shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling that only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating. It is a fact that, like most Indian films, the film has its only true and complete effect if viewed in its original language. Much of the films' feelings and meaning are embedded in their Marathi dialogues, which, however, cannot be translated effectively into English. <br /> <br /> Shwaas explores in detail the relationship between a grandparent and a child. And it completes justice for this strong bond. Dialogues like "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (my parsha is also one in a million) increase emotions. Anyone who has carefully observed the grandparent's child's relationship will be able to relate to the situation depicted in the film. Overall, it is definitely worth seeing. It's a movie that has left me a deep impact. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
