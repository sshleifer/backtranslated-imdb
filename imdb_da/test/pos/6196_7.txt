Smartly written, well-acted, intense and exciting. This show lives in the real world, not as amazing as "24" (and I'm a big fan of 24 by the way). It has credible characters and is in many ways much smarter than most in this genre. It is trying to present both sides of Islam. So far I have seen the first 4 episodes and found the story more evenly balanced. The terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And because of this balance, the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains are portrayed in movies and on television. Last but not least, the hero is really heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.
