Toy Soldiers is an okay action movie, but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriter and director put in to depict US terrorist forces precisely. Just check the end credit - there are more than a dozen US military officers and officials. The film depicts the FBI precisely as having control over the hostage situation, but reversing it over US Army's Delta Force (which is named in the movie when the Pentagon still refused their existence at this time) when the president rejected the Posse Commitatus Act of American Code the end is exactly dressed and armed for the time being. And even the use of an AH-64 Apache for air support - which may seem a little over the top, is not terribly unrealistic. Far more expensive and honestly better films have depicted US terrorist forces with far less accuracy.
