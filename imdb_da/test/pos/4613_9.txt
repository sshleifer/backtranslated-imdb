Good sadness sethrp-1, you've totally missed the point. The girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who had to kill herself ... everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories that they didn't notice her, nor did we. As one of the other students says in the end - we are all so wrapped up in our own problems, we do not notice what is going on for another. <br /> <br /> The director himself said if he had killed one of the others, it would have suggested that their problems were worse than anyone else's. The whole point of killing Kelly was that she was unnoticed by us all. Get it now??
