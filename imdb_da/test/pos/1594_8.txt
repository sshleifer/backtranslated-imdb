CAUTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved a little slowly, the amazing scenery, the richness of the characters and the powerful themes 'Morte a Venezia' give a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am sure that Visconti's visual splendor, musical score and powerful conflicts and desire statements will do it justice. <br /> <br /> The study by Gustav von Aschenbach refers to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This trend has been demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav, when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical - ie. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio alone plays 'Fuer Elise' in the lobby of the hotel, and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is attracted to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his recall after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction serves as a reminder of the moral response to the temptations that Tadzio represents. In the end, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and retire to his desires and temptations? Or flee Venice to save its own life? His early attempt to flee Venice in the railway station resulted in a vain and shadowing of the outcome of the extension of his stay. <br /> <br /> Complementing the fascinating character interaction, Visconti's powerful nature (especially Venice at Dawn and the last scene of Tadzio entering the water and pointing to the horizon) makes this movie a true masterpiece.
