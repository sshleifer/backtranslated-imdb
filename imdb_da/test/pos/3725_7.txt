Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre that he will return fourteen years later with the "Fifth Element" (1997). Although this movie was heavily influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still very entertaining. Back in 1983, "Le Dernier Combat" reveals Besson's own approach to science fiction. He takes an item question back and his efforts are visible to do a stylish job. Widescreen and black and white shot has a disaster destroyed almost the entire population from the ground and we will never know what was this disaster and why men cannot speak any more. Some barbaric hordes were formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives at an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). There is no word in Besson's work. The characters' actions and the evolution of events go through appearance and movement. Although the starting point and background are unpleasant, the film never has the appearance of a despondent. It seems that the man and the doctor are trying to reproduce gestures and actions related to humanity before the disaster. The film opens with the man who has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to get him to talk through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's more exciting, as these paintings seem to come from prehistoric times. Following this justification, one can argue that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) designs evil and threatens the efforts of the man and the doctor to regain what finally became a human being. The same for the god's evil at the beginning of the movie. The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey is not really in the foreground and allows for a glimpse of hope. Personally, the movie could not have got any music at all, except the one you can hear with its cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still foreign films like this, he also increased Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a rude work behind him in the future: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), " Petite Entreprise "(1999) or" Filles Uniques "(2003).
