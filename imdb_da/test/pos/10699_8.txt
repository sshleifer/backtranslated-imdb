This is a pretty stupid movie, including what is perhaps the smallest erotic comedy ever to make it the big screen (the heroine leans V-8 all by himself and invites the hero to lick it out - yuck!). And yet it also has the glorious Lucinda Dickey in what is by far her most erotic achievement. In the long days, women - even action forces - with real muscles were a rarity, and I still remember the way my jaw fell when Dickey took off his shirt and revealed the strongest built female back and biceps I had ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality bears the film: she could have been a female schwarzenegger if someone had had the vision of promoting her.
