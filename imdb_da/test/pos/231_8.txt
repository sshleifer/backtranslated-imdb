The most notable feature of this film is chemistry between the actors, the feeling of companionship in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising star musical has an overtime plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it is still fun to watch. Hayworth is not even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of "inexperienced" charm to suit her character. Kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers gives lots of self-disobedience and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.
