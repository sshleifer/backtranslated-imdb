It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It is reminiscent of the NY City City mind of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, raising his own pet, and eventually retiring into his adoptive parent's bed. Absolutely absurd, it sees life through the magic glasses and sees things that they "really are" ... I don't think it's ever shown anymore. If so, someone would probably Tivo the case and put it out there. A kidnapping goes wrong: Mixed in a rain, dashing in and out or shop fronts, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws her into her bike-driven ice car that jumps her out to her basement apartment in the village. He is surprised, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come out: instead of a delicious lady, he has captured a medieval suburban housewife who speaks and talks and speaks. The film is full of vignettes of commuters life, suburban life, city officials, and all attitudes so deeply held. It pushes the boundaries of comedy, as magical reality can push a drama, much like Daffy Duck is capable of drawing imaginative scenes to demonstrate his suffering or desires, much of the plausibility. Everything is humorous, no one is meaningful.
