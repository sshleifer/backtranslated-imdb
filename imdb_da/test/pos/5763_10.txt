I have not written a review here for ages but rewatching all tied TV shows, live shows and this I felt I had to make my views on this movie known! It is, I feel, the perfect comedy movie. It lacks lovey dovey story lines (I wouldn't really call rigions perception with Gina Carbonara's love would you? Or he and Eddie go up there naked ... not love) that makes the rest of the comedys go from good to shame it lacks the usual dilemmas that you have to overcome in most other comedy films ... unless you count the fact that they poisoned the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma similar to other comedy films ..... No, this movie just puts out and succeeds in doing one thing and only one thing: making a laugh. What does a comedy film require? Laughter. This movie just raises a laugh after grin without filling the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies! So I call it the only perfect comedy movie ever made and I will never stop watching this beautiful movie! I applaud Rick and Ade on such a wonderful genius!
