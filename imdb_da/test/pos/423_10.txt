I like "Hack." Think that "Lone Ranger" is reincarnated as a 2000-year-old driver, a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia doing his best while trying to solve troubles from a troubled past and you have synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of riding "Silver" in the old west he drives a cab through the usual streets of modern Philly without handing out silver balls. The support supports are first class and well above average. At times, the witty dialogue almost reaches the level of the 70's classic series, "The Rockford Files." This show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time game than 9 PM Friday (Eastern).
