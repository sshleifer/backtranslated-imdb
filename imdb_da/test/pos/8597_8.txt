Why is there so much anxiety among IMDb reviewers who hate this movie? It's not a masterpiece, but having seen it twice, it stands as a compelling drama in the world of network TV. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan, Phillip Stone, and Brian What's his name on NBC. A mannequin of a man who is not capable of love who is professionally successful but fails in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in networking news and Robin Stone is EXIST! <br /> <br /> The support molding works for me from Cannon (which can be annoying but is not in this movie) to Greene who plays pathos just right) to Wexler (who scores as the young model in love with the picture of Prince Charming and cannot unite the image with the real ugly inside). Also by note is the end that some IMDb reviewer claims is a cop-out. It is not! Listen to the song "He Moves on" to show the bow, Robin Stone character moves, bringing him to finally overcome his problems. He realizes that the answers are not with the life he has lived, and the symbolic walk away from those he is associated with is finally perfect.
