If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme race types, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are keen to see a rare piece of war animation, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye patrols the oceans and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen trick Popeye into believing they want a peace agreement signed. But appearance can be fraud; the fishing boats turn out to be a Japanese naval ship! What is followed today is considered to be moral-enhancing propaganda. Be aware, Japan's representations in the film are performed in a medieval manner. Remember, however, that there was a war at that time. But I highly recommend this cartoon to those interested in World War II.
