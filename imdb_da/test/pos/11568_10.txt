After the success of "Muppet Babies" Warner Brothers beat "Tiny Toons". But instead of making Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the rest of the Looney Toon band, they created new animal characters that were kids with their own different personalities, but personalities who still mirrored their predecessors. The wires included Buster & Babs Bunny (no relation that became their current gag or catch phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, rats and various animals of Perfecto Prep, and the original Looney Toons threw themselves. "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and participated in Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon band served as mentors to the younger generation in and out of comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show, various shots were taken at Bush SR. administration, pop culture and in combination with various other gags and spoofs. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, possibly the main characters of the show, as mentioned above, resembled Bugs Bunny in some respects, but they also had their own different personality tabs and comics, namely the Bab's tendency to imitate anyone and everyone while Buster, who is able to be a great goof himself, usually played straight men (or even rabbits) to Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not screwball Daffy but egomaniac Daffy), with almost as big an ego as Daffy and as much of an obsession with upstaging Buster & Babs as Daffy had with upstaging bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempt, however, he remained strangely widespread. The Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the tireless task of playing Porky for Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blonde duck gal, was a new age-old girl who Plucky wanted to go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her feelings. Dizzy was the tiny version of the Tasmanian devil. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird. There was also the purple female skunk who longed for a girlfriend and pint sized versions of Wile Coyote and Road Runner. Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a nice child who was always out to make money or make people's lives miserable. There was also Elmira, a fake animal life that everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a weird thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except he was from "Wacky Land" or something. <br /> <br /> Pop culture references included Batman (quite often actually), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dance with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food Collections, the Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons among other. <br /> <br /> Not only fun, but also managed to be hot and touching, something it is the successor "Animaniacs" never quite achieved. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
