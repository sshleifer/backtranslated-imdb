You, the living (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I've never written this word before, but it's going to think here. Let me turn it up. Well, that's part of it - corrosive, but also fun. So corrosive fun. This is a sour film, with so much dry, dry dry white and quirky humor it is impossible not to like it at some level. Filmed in a very exciting style, often with a static camera and really balanced, stable compositions, such as theater stages, we see a short enactment. <br /> <br /> But that makes it seem ordinary - which it is not. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, lovely, coy and depressing. And impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we live, we can also take note. Something in that style. I think it was Ebert who said that you find yourself laughing and not knowing why. Exactly. And the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python, and what they think is that it has the dry, silent look of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish film, but it has it hanging on one or the other. Another way to touch elements of British comedians. <br /> <br /> I would say, absolutely, definitely see at least half an hour of this. There is a part of me that I thought was through then - the rest continues in a similar composition of small sketches and moments, and they gradually evolve, but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. There are some good moments later, even just attention to thunderstorms that take us out of human human events nicely. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautiful in its classic control, almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (and actually exaggerating the photographer). And the actor, with all his ordinary, non-gleaming folksiness, is right on. A spectacular, beautiful, strange experience.
