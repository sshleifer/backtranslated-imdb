I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the store located just on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost contact and wanted me to be able to restore now as an adult. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there might be five or six people who even remember the show being aired in the first place. They just do no more as such, do they? I wonder if it would still stop this day and age. Do you know anyone who could burn DVDs of the show, they taped on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
