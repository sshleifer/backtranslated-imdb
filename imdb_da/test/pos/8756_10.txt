Traffic is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs (about 1987). It tells three stories in parallel about how opium grows in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from Pakistan to Europe and finally how people rely on drug spirals out of control. All three stories are told realistically and with empathy. You see enough of the characters living to understand how ordinary people can be sucked into a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not short cuts, the opium producer is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with weapons and other opium growers. The drug smuggler is a rich German without heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose to lead her life "the old way" or give up. Finally, the prime minister has the hardest role in dealing with the emotional destruction caused by his own daughter. She slips into drug abuse and starts stealing, suffering from ill health, attacking her parents emotionally, so that she can continue to satisfy her desire for the drug (heroin) that destroys her life. <br /> <br /> Traffic is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on television. The scenes in this show remain with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
