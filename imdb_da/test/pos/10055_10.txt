I have to judge this movie on a 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's classic comedy. So if you rate it for other Madonna movies ... well what? Do you want to tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? has Mira Sorvino not won an Oscar for almost the same achievement, not ten years later? Please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. Plus, I like to think of it as a sociological study in the 80s lifestyle. Remember when you could shop from Sam Goody and Cartier the same day? Remember when women had bushy eyebrows proud? so it was not "last emperor", it was still good. There are certain movies I would be willing to watch every day. three, actually, it pep up my day and make me smile. if you like "who is that girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
