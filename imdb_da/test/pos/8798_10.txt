The movie itself is absolutely brilliant, it's the buzz, the rush that makes you just want to go out, blow your wages and lose yourself. It's about weekend, it's our sanitation, where we can come together as one and be ourselves without care in the world. The film is layered in depth, and the dialogue in places is just the place on, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are instantly sympathetic, one is of course a animal's character and his view of what "Star Wars" is really about, genius. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an hour to kill before you go out, stick to this, you will immediately feel yourself growing in confidence, definitely recommending it.
