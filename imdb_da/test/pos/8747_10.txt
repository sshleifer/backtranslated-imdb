I was disappointed with the recent (2000) American remake of this English mini-series. Although it followed the plot line very closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention adding superficial preachy heavy-handed 'messages' ... So my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick to the original. It is much longer, but gripping and quite well done. Interesting, complex and textured without the self-righteous sermons ... and it's also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> I find it wrong that these heartless remakes of big overseas movies get so much Hollywood fanfare on Oscars. (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro to get some deserved praise ...)
