I first saw this movie two years ago at the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brotherly teenage sisters who are at home in their large country estate with their father and founder. Their relationship with their mother-in-law is strained to say the least, as the genealogy is becoming increasingly unstable in its struggles with the younger girls. The film, however, shines with Oriental style ghost effects and horror, adding a strange and disturbing aspect to the story, which at first view is not clear, but is more exciting. The direction is incredibly good, and the play is amazing, especially with the pedigree, who is incredibly good, swings from one mood to another in the movie. The big house adds annoyance and there are enough points in the movie where you will jump out of your seat. This movie clearly shows me why Korean cinema is possibly the best original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything in the Western world, unfortunately and I can really see it being influential on filmmakers around the world in the next decade. Recommended view in my opinion, a real joy and scare ...
