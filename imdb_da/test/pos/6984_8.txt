The effects of other science fiction and thriller films and stories are evident throughout this film. The movies that come to mind right away are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite straightforward and not all the original, sleep-adapted voyages through space, crash landing on the planet without apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out and force different types of people to work together for their mutual survival. while the body counts mounts. This kind of movie always tends to be fun as long as it's done well. I think Pitch Black was doing well. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them, the longer the movie continues, and I think people will be surprised by who does and does not. Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotyped convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physical skill, high tolerance for pain and can comfortably see in the dark. You know he ends up doing the right thing at some point in the movie because it is suggested throughout the movie that he can actually have a conscience about things. Cole House plays the fabric depending on the bounty hunter who is probably in many ways a really bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character reveals the whole movie. It is most likely that he is most brave when the odds and firepower are to his advantage. A very self-service character that eventually gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the convicted vessel that is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteoric storm or tail end of a comment. When he finds the pilot dead in his bedroom, she tries to land the ship, leading to our discovery of its character's fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and leadership. Her character in history's short range grows most likely because she actually grows some conviction, takes responsibility and doesn't sit and wait to be gobbled up by nightstands aliens. In some strange way she connects with Riddick's eternally distant human side, who in turn respects her for her choices and is associated with them. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the story looks like you would expect, but I think you will be mildly surprised at what characters survive this horrible experience. This movie is an entertaining train wreck starting to see. Go see it! <br /> <br />
