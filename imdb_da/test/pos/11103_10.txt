There is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. I think the truth has always been alien to fiction. The Falcon and Snowman tell the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual, trying to find a profession that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealistic son a job working in the defense department. Boyce has little responsibility and seems to be complacent about drinking and walking around with his colleagues. But as time goes on, Boyce begins to learn secret information that causes him to doubt the morals of his governments. The idealistic Boyce soon sees the illegal operations carried out by the CIA in all places, Australia. Boyce finally decides that he will leak some of the top secret information he is interested in into the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is the assumption that the USSR is the good guy because the US is doing bad things. Over time, Boyce and his drug dealer, Lee (Penn), begin selling their top secret information to the KGB. What once was idealism becomes capitalism and espionage. The strength of this movie is the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, both will soon find themselves in an infinite downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not just a good movie, but one of my all-time favorites.
