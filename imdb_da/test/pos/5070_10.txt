Extraordinary transfer is a scary practice that is allowed, surprisingly under Clinton, which allows the US government to seize and hold any suspect, for some reason, apparently, a terrorist to the United States. This is a meticulous issue, especially after 9/11, because the practitioners of the exercise always criticize the opposition for withholding vital powers from the United States to effectively combat terror. Fanatic followers will feel the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> However, as a recent movie that lent a similar humanity level to the death penalty, David Gale's life, Rendition shows us a story of abuse of extraordinary transfers, or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and used False. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer born in Egypt, who is seized on his way back to America from giving lectures in Egypt. The reason is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. No evidence has ever been given (or needed) that it was Anwar who made the calls that his phone was never lost by stolen. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the states and tried to find her husband who arrived on a flight to Chicago, but apparently never came out. The flimsy explanation that he was never there is vaporized when she discovers that he made a purchase in aircraft using his credit card. <br /> <br /> At the last minute I researched modern Chinese history, especially the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship created by Mao Tse-tung, and it is more than a little daunting to see the similarities between extraordinary transfers and some of Mao's brutal frightening tactics, including his public executions (which the people were forced to see) and the extensive use of torture specifically used to extract "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to note that Mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear of obedience from the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created a fear environment and continues to munch it for whatever it is worth would be naive to the utmost, and even though extraordinary rendering was not created under Bush, it is clear that it do more harm than good. <br /> <br /> The addition of the film's thickness is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the CIA and has a little field experience until his boss is murdered and he suddenly finds himself overseeing the torture of a a man whom he is in doubt of quickly has something to reveal. Fatima's (Freeman's boss) daughter also plays a decisive role, as does a senatorial help that Peter Sarsgaard plays, which may have the most satisfactory role in the film. Meryl Streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a cool senator with a dogmatic support for the necessity and exercise of extradition. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the film is remarkably well designed and paced. But the frightening thing about it is that it's all right. The film's goal is to make people really think about the things done in American name, especially when they claim to be done to prevent the same things. Carrying out terror to prevent terror will not gain any sympathy for us or extract confessions through brutal torture, which is the basic form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in the direction of doing these things rather than less. The frightening question is, what is the event that will take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and lead the other way to civilization and peace, or will we just continue toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there?
