Due to characters previously developed in a series of reputable shorts, WORRABITET COURSE is as far from "family fare" that you can get: beautifully crafted and witty dialogue and smart concepts, this is really a movie that will appeal to almost all family members. The story relates to Wallace and his dog Gromit, who lives in a village that is obsessed with growing vegetables for the annual fair and running "anti-pesto", a humane solution for all the annoying rabbits who plague passionate gardeners everywhere. The company is a great success - but Wallace proves to be wise for his own benefit. When trying to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their vegetable-intensive ways, he unexpectedly releases an old horror of legendary proportions: Were-Rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly smart dialogue and references to everything from King KONG to WOLF MAN - more than enough to lure even an abandoned teenager - but the real charm of the matter is in his characters. The number of personality that artists and animators can turn from clays is amazing: they seem to be quite alive as any meat-and-blood actor. DVD release (and I recommend widescreen) also includes a number of informative and entertaining extras. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
