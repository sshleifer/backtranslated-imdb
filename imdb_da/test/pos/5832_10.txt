Oz, was the first original TV show that HBO put on his channel (in 1 hour form), and it's the best day to this day ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look at the lives of the tall Maximum security prisoner at Oswald, primarily focusing on "Em City". Now there are many things to compliment this show on from the writing (which, in my opinion, was the best on television when this show was broadcast), steering (top notch), acting (best of best) and the characters ... This show only literally blew my socks off ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until The Sopranos bowed, after critics were salivating over the epic tale of trust and family noticing this compelling drama ... Oz to me is a better show than Sopranos collected, and it's a shame that I've never won any big Emmys ... kudos to anyone involved in this magnificent, gut-cutting show ... <br /> <br /> KUDOS
