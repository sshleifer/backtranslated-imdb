I am a giant buttock, and at nearly 44 I have just discovered this flick for the first time. I found it in a roundabout from Space 1999, then UFO. I was looking for other Anderson creations and found this to be their first live action work. What a home run! I have actually heard about this movie many years ago, but never knew what it was called, so I'm happy to have accidentally found it. <br /> <br /> These Anderson's were nothing short of amazing in their writing, performing the truly credible and realistic models, the quality of acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I don't think it seems to be dated at all. Let me tell you ... I take good old models of the fake-looking CGI crap today, anytime! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes were quite real. They had it for a science! If you choose to think about what you see as genuine, it is not hard to actually believe it. <br /> <br /> Also, the amount of detail in the set design, the beautiful photograph, the whole look. .. man I wish I could go back to then! They knew how to make great movies in the 60s. Personally, I have lost all interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Take the models back! Think of all the people who are hired! Anyway, I'm ranting. :-) If you like good sci-fi that is very well done, you will do yourself a favor by seeing this.
