I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It's been one of my favorites since ... It's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack, cheesy dialogue, and it was both fun and terribly sad. The first movie I really just had room for at the end ... I don't wanna spoil it for you, but boy is it a rogue guy ... I just remember feeling so sorry Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie is that genius !!! They are all so good even the nerdy girl Gary doesn't like ... (she had a nice little body though). I can't believe all the girls go to Rick, he's such a sleaze ball with the handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... When you see this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story in the heart with real-life issues that act from insecurity to life and change decisions that make you think and feel genuine grief for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl once again classic you will too!
