My ex wife and I saw and were fascinated by the trailer for this movie. We waited to get out, but when it did, it didn't get much in theaters. Several years later I bought it on VHS and I transfer it to DVD so I can keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. It's about real events in a real country. BURMA got such a bad reputation for the political repression that caused them to change their name. <br /> <br /> I find women with a little makeup to be very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are only short. <br /> <br /> Having come home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. A bad feature for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) speaks to her about taking a vacation to Burma. While she is witnessing a peaceful demonstration, her passport has been stolen. In a bold (or stupid) move she asks a tourist guide to show her something out of the tourist trail. Her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to make herself safe. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at this, it reminds me that in the United States we forget it for a farmer Living under military rule, SOCIALISM, where at least eating is almost guaranteed, it looks good .
