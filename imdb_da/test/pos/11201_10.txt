This is not a movie that impresses on high budget, high-tech images, fast-paced camera moves or glittering costumes that are thought of by an overwhelming and hungry instructor. But it is a film by a director who is also a very good photographer who has a very good sense of looking at things like a human, not as a demigod in contrast to most directors. This is not a movie where actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unreal or at best learned movements and imitations. Rather, it is a movie where they seem as real as it can be. In fact, they are not at all professional players at all. The dialogues between the protagonists, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be in real life. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid expressing in words. You show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest. This is the same sense of interruption that you get in modern city life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, distinguished by the protagonists. I saw all the films by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, incl. his short movie Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it in the DVD. Many would compare him with Tarkovsky, Ozu and maybe Bresson or Bergman as he emerges as a true writer. And he is sincere to say that his film does not make money but to make sense of his life. It's the kind of sincerity you find in Uzak.
