When I was five, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at. 14 every day. The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as hostesses for this children's TV show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was done in a study with only 54 episodes being reissued again and again. I remember Sherlock, the puppet in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract and alphabet. For thirty minutes a day I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember these days as pleasurable memories, and now I hope today's children can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories, cheap props, riding the swings and talking to dolls. The set was ideal and simple, but it was Carole and Janis who made it worth while while he was. I miss my childhood and the days when the most important thing was to see the Magic Garden. Life seemed so much simpler and better. Now I hope the children today enjoy the show.
