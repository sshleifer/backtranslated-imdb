If it had been made 2 years later, it would have been BANNED! The number should see the recommendation of the day! The best Rouben Mamoulian movie I've seen so far (has not yet seen J + H). It's no wonder why this movie got less than 200 votes. A larger gray area that could not fit less about what is proper would not be seen again before the 60s. As morally ambiguous and dark as 70's, but with some charm too. Of course it had to be low in the later 30s and unfortunately it did not seem to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. This got it all. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and this time not so lovable Guy Kibbee. And a great good director. So far, I haven't been RM's biggest fans, but I've seen his movie a lot, and with this he goes into a new league. One of the best 30's movies I've ever seen! This is something I never thought even existed! 9.5 / 10
