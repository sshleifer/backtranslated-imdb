what a refreshing change from the PG movies that have teenage girls jumping in and out of bed, young youth educators count how many girls they can "hook up" with, children drink, make drugs, etc. etc. Carl Hiaasen has written so many books that are fun, but hardly classic literature. But he has finally written something that Middle School kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to children who might make a difference that maybe their voices may be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and right. Who cares about its predictable and somewhat corny. So was FREE WILLY and see how well it did. This is a good family movie .......... a rare race.
