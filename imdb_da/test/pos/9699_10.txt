This movie is fun. I would say much more painful and disgusting than the previous film. The entire film from the previous film and series is present. <br /> <br /> These kinds of movies are great to watch in MovieTheater, because the entire audience is crying with laughter, especially on the terrorist part that was damn disgusting. I wish they made more of these kind of movies. <br /> <br /> Strong stomach required! They got some crazy stunts this time around. Warning: contains many snakes! I'd like to write about it, but I just can't spoil the fun. Go see it !!!
