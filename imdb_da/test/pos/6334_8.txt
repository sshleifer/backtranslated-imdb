This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Many people love it and at a creative level it is brilliant. Most of the episode has no dialogue, which is such a good idea, and "Hush" handles the silence really well. This episode also introduces Tara, which I like a lot. But I don't like Riely or Initative or Maggie Walsh, and they seem to get a lot of screen time in "Hush". Besides, I don't think the gentlemen are so scary, and I get tired of seeing float around Sunnydale. I know I'm in the minority, but I tend to speed up parts of "Hush". Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you look at DVD, I recommend watching this episode. It's really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" revolves around the city and loses their voices. Skalatal looking demon-guys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human war, they die. Then they steal all the city's voices. Buffy and Scoobies are trying to figure out what's going on while the Initative is also starting to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander will realize how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen. They're both stunned about what they're learning ... He's a command and she's a slayer. In the end, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> Really, the creativity of "Hush" cannot be seen in a basic disposition of its reason. It is the episode's overwhelming silence that does so well. The characters try to communicate in different ways (widespread boards, pantomime, obscene finger movements, etc ...) and it all works really well. After a while you forget that there is no dialogue because they are so good at expressing themselves. During the "talking" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of "hearing" each other. Anya claims that Xander doesn't really want to talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander protests and insists Spike moves into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "petroleum" for "patrolling" when she speaks to Riely so she doesn't have to explain her call. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all pretty cool. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts to this episode. I love people remembering they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley cannot use the voice recognition object in the Initatives elevator. People are trying to scream. It is basically what everyone really would do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's fun that Spike should move in with Xander. (They will also share an apartment for a while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that is just fun. I also like the start of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show, and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out. <br /> <br /> On the downside, I don't understand how the gentleman chooses their victims. They just seem to be flying around dormitories and choosing random people. I also don't like Riely. I never wanted him, but from "Hush" I just expect angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we have just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is fine ... and then she suddenly fell. I do not understand it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: Giles' "Who are my lords?" lectures to Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful, and his heads are just funny. He makes some similar-looking flashcards in season seven's "First Date." Almost anytime Giles starts drawing monsters, it's just fun.
