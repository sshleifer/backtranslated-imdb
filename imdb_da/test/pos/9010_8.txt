I just love this show.It is so fun and cool.Kuzco is such a fun and interesting character, I love him. He is the thing that makes this show what it is, though Kronk and Yzma are so fun and charming too. Everything about this show is great to me because it always cuts me to laugh, whether it's just an episode. It's just so much fun, and all the characters are so lovable and cool, it makes the show worth watching, unlike some crap on Disney channel. Give this show a try the next time it's on if you've seen the movie, and Even if you haven't seen the movie, you will find it very fun anyway, so keep going.
