I love this movie. Excited with big figures. The child from "Sandlot" is excellent as Corey Feldman. When the children storm on the bank, it is purely adrenaline. Inside the bank it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Flies" situation where they turn on each other. Justin Walker from "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" during channel surfing. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also quite good here as the little town of Sheriff. Taylor Nichols, who I love from "Barcelona" does a good job also as a Federal Agent. I recommend this movie to any fan of film robbery with many good characters. I was shocked to find that Roger Corman was a producer of this, as the film is not a B-movie.
