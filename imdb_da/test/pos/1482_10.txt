When I was younger, and today is Mr. Bean a genius work. Three-time BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human alien fell on Earth causing chaos and evil wherever he might go. He tried to do an exam, put his pants in front of a blind man (he didn't know he was blind), went to church, tried to dive into a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, saw scary movies, changed in his car, had a picnic with a flying intrusion, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), looked for a baby in Portsmouth, been at Room 426 in The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet competition with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair and even met and knocked out the queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, The Think It's Over Nick Hancock, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today's David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Fast Show's Eryl Maynard and Vicer's Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack. BAFTAs were nominated for Best Comedy (Program or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Program. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 largest British actors, he was number 24 on the comedian's comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's favorite comedian. Excellent!
