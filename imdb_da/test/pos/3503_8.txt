Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the movie does not reach the quality of the TV show, it is still very fun and has some seriously evil moments! I have wanted Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he is one of the best comedy characters all the time .. up there with eg. Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this movie was that they actually made some serious actors do it (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will definitely respect them even more, to have the good sense of taking this opportunity. I have nothing really bad to say about this movie, it's a lot of fun. Very young, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> One more thing for Mr G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
