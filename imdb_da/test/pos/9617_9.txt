I was first introduced to this movie in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was the 2nd in a double function. Unfortunately, the theater, where I saw this, was torn down. Anyways, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the United States the following year. Like a lot of "other" Kung-Fu movies released while running on "coat-tails" by Enter the Dragon, this movie was really good. It is the story of a country boy sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his fighting skills. Meanwhile, "opponent" plans martial arts school and plan to counteract our hero, using dirty tactics to try to throw him free and try to prevent him from joining the tournament. To my surprise, I thought since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the US, Warner Bros. had to issue a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie has been released in both English and Cantonise, w / subtitles ..... the latter a more "cleaner & clearer" version. Although the fighting sequences are a little fun to look at (ie flying in the air and hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using the head .... literally .... hitting his opponent, etc.), is it still classic king fu action wonderfully planned and executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection ..... if you can find it.
