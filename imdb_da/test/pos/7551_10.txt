FOUR FRIENDS were first billed on HBO for 82 as a sleeping hit. After hearing the word "sleeping" when 14, I was eager to see one. (!) Boy - was I surprised! The film! I was not really in love with a movie without special films outside of SIERRA MADRE'S TREASURE - much less a "hippy flick" ... but had grown up with a few hippies - I understood the power behind Mr. Penn's movie. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of a kind. The script is so technical - and it did throw !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor as well! He just personifies "writer type" to a tee - both smart and clumsy (the scene at the window ...) and strong but yet so much vulnerable. For me - he catches what it is to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade ... and I've always found comfort in the character - and in the movie. During the 1980s, four friends were a crime partner for me - and I caught the movie every time I could on HBO - though I had to be up to 5:00! And still, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters are shared by viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies "the girl" to the hilt - it's so hard not to be charmed by her. This movie really is the time test. Every time I check my video of it ... or show a friend ... and it still gets a solid reaction. I have known women who completely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredibly small 60s humanity. Very special, very magical. I recently found the NOW OF FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach - and the film is even more detailed! Actual events, etc. A real find! And what's more - haha ​​- I found the novel while turning on a used bookstore ... in Omaha, NE of ALL places !!! You must have an eye on her! When I was in L.A. in 92 as an extra - I went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop - and there was a TON of still pictures from the movie !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and couldn't spoil ... but boy, the pictures of Georgia and the boys together just went right through me! I met director Joe Sergant on set SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in the summer of 92 ... and we were talking about four friends - very cool! Also ... working on a video store in Omaha in 98 - was waiting for a woman who was a family of Jim Metzler ..! Told her to pass the word that there was a child in Omaha who was just fanatical about the movie - and had made the most of it. Once again - the film captures everything that is in the Danilo character's heart ... big, great work --- one of mrs. Tesich and Penn's finest efforts. Steve Tesich is very much missed. An amazing author. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
