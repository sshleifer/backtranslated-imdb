Incredibly hilarious mid-70's Italian red flotation with lots of non-conscientious S&M, lesbian sex, free racist cruelty, etc. Get redeeming movie features, except for the pretty cool theme music with dubby "African" drums and flute. Brilliant sample dialog: <br /> <br /> White Slave Owner (for White Plantation Manager): "You're so stupid, I bet you forgot to interrogate what is midwife!" <Br /> <br /> White Plantation Manager: "I have not only interrogated her, I did so well, she died before I could get an answer from her!" <br /> <br /> All the black actors have the 70s afros and say "yes, mass" in a high voice. The female manager has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze.
