A raw edgy thriller that was aimed at great philosophical heights it couldn't reach. I still enjoy the movie enormously. It had great excitement and left me the lovely spine I expect from thrillers, and it achieved this purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and doing. The sound track and setting added the voltage perfectly. At times it was a little unpolished, especially the play and character development. It could only have been a better movie if we had known more about the nightmares of the past, the signs see when they close their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to seek the "answer" so integrated into history. After all, they seemed to continue to search it, despite knowing, or at least having a limitation on what might happen when they found it. I would recommend watching this movie if you are prepared to look beyond the gravel to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.
