Yes, it's "Flipper". But author / director Alan Shapiro has put together a gem of a version. Spectacular over and underwater photography from "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and the haunting music of Joel McNeely and Crosby, Stills & Nash make this truly memorable family entertainment. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely "The Crush", once again turns out to be an extremely talented and versatile filmmaker. Rent it!
