The above-mentioned profile was written by me when I used the quilt for OldWereWolf56, which is still my email address. I still think Andy Devine's character Frisky is the best Twilight Zone episode ever, and I see this episode at least once a year as I consider Frisby to be a lucky man, as he has many friends who love him deeply. <br /> <br /> If many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61, Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment program in the 50's, which I thought was Andy's Gang. In addition, he had three assistants: A cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse called Squeaky, who played a hand organ and a devilish paddie named Froggy, who can appear and disappear, will scare many of Andy's fun guest stars like Billy Gilbert.
