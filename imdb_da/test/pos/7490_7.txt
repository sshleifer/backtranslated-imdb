It looks so much like films like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS, which is impossible to believe that Tarantino's film was not a source of inspiration for this Thursday. But for a cheap B-series movie, it's not bad. The plot of gangsters is captivating and fun, and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources were not too acidic, but the film is well-produced. The action is also good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl sat on the couch and teased the doctor ... It was hot and fun at the same time! The soundtrack is also nice. I didn't hear too many songs, but the ones I heard I liked. I score it 7/10.
