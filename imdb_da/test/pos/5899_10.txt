I watch this movie every time it plays on TV. A simply brilliant film. Three men return from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three led opposite lives during the war (Executive Banks became an army corporal, a soda became an air force captain, and high school football hero lost both his arms in battle) and now each has to reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality. The homes they return to, with adult children and independent, work women with a depressed economy, adding only to the battle. It is the scenes right at the camera and the unspoken dialogue that resonates most loudly. Frederich March and Myrna Loy's awkward intimacy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is nit as the beautiful, decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters, each portrayed by a gifted actor. <br /> <br /> However, this movie took a whole second level after watching, "Saving Private Ryan." The reality and size of what these men lived through for love and country ...... and of course it did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is important for any collection. <Br /> <br />
