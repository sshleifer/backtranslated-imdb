Flash Gordon was a first class series. I know there were a few goofs, but I didn't see it for the mistakes. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not an educated actor, but he gave a very good and convincing performance. Jean Rogers is beautiful and at age 20. old, in my opinion, did a pretty good job. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming is excellent. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His depiction of "Ming The Merciless", in all 3 Flash Gordon series, was top notch. The rest of the throw also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy. John R.
