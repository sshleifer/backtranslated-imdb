If you've been looking for a movie where an undefined nympho is linked to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man, look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly what I just described, you say? Well then you get the best in yourself and mosey down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you are open and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason why you will not leave the theater happy that you saw it. <br /> <br /> In the third offer from Director Craig Brewer, we have entered the deep south where, as the tagline to the film, everything is hotter. While we are introduced to the God-fearing bluesman, Lazarus, as said earlier by Jackson, and the almost always half naked Rae; a role bravely taken by Christina Ricci. In the film, this unlikely pair of lanes makes it long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from each other. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us audiences, no matter what we are all people. No one is perfect, and if everyone would realize it, we would be much better. The question of whether this will be understood or accepted by anyone watching the movie is another story. <br /> <br /> One thing that is not up for debate is how big both Jackson and Ricci are here. You would think with the role of a sex-scared woman, overactive would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci goes through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson, who disappears completely, and for the first time we get to forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's military-bound boyfriend, is not that big. In the beginning, he fails unlucky, as he seems to be trying too hard. Later he picks it up, but he is far from the level he reached in January 'Alpha Dog'. The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts is an excellent soundtrack. Contains tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from Scott Bomar's scoring, and of course four, counting them, four tracks from Jackson himself. In fact, it's one of his songs, the movie's main achievement, 'Stackolee', which is the fuel for the fire in this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomars' The Chain, "When the lights go out" from Black Keys and the title track, which is also among the most memorable scenes in the movie where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night. <br /> <br /> Craig Brewer's efforts cannot go without mentioning. His last film 'Hustle & Flow', which ended up exceeding low expectations and gaining critical recognition, put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other novices to the industry. He not only instructed 'Moan', but also wrote his manuscript. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you can see, you want to know exactly where it is going, despite its bravery. Just as you think you've predicted the next step, the Brewer changes gear and takes a completely different route. There are, however, some spots in the manuscript. The background signs are dull and flat, while the finish is a bit disappointing. It left me craving something more exciting. After so many heights, I think the final scenes were a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. I imagine that most people who see 'Black Snake Moan' will not enjoy it because of fact they will not be able to stop thinking about how unlikely the situations are. The disappointing part about it is that there are many other movies with equally unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely received. It is the question of race, religious motives and sexuality that the film shows that will have more effect on meaning than anything. The idea of ​​a black man chaining a white woman into her house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. In short, it's not for everyone. As I said, to fully enjoy it, you have to go with an open mind, or you just waste your money. For those of you who can do that, I highly recommend it.
