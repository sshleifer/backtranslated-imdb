This film has an excellent play by Marilia PÃªra and a fantastic dicretcion by the Argentine Hector Babenco. This, in my opinion, is the best Brazilian movie ever made. The film was filmed with children from 'favelas', the Brazilian ghetos. The children were not actors and were thrown by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children arrested in the corrective prison that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately, it is not pure fiction, in Brazil it happens today. One must see for those who like violent movies. But take your mother out of the room because it's a hard movie.
