I can't believe people give bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit it really doesn't follow the book ... surely ... the book by dean koontz is much better ... but the movie is also good too !!! it has the excitement ... the actor is good ... especially michael ironside who has given a great play in this movie !!! <br /> <br /> came a guy ... give this movie a chance. .. there are still much more worse movies than this .... like the sum of all the fears ... phantoms ... then the vinci code ... these are some of the worse movies I've seen ... really boring if compared to viewers who really have great elements in the movie ... this movie contains great excitement and non stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to be found on DVD ... <br /> <br /> then then ... I really recommended this movie to anyone ... see it! !!! you will never regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
