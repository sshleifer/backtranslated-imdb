Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940s and 1950 on the Jewish experience in the United States. Except for Crossfire (1947) and the Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had a musical theater background. These films included The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), The Eddy Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Benny Goodman Story (1956), and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The leading players in these "Jewish" films were always played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks played a non-Jew Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme appealing to a mostly non-Jewish audience. Jazz Singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devoted Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish, although she plays a non-practicing Judaism in the movie. The purpose of her background is when she goes to Golding's family meal before she enters, she says, "I haven't been in a saddle (Easter service) since I went home." <br /> <br /> The movie is about a canton son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> But there's much more to this movie than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during McCarthy Whitchhunts and Hollywood Blacklist. Therefore, the Jews in this movie are shown as good loyal citizens, and <br /> <br /> are quintessential Americans. The synagogue would rather play baseball than exercise. The canteens friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited. Therefore, Jews are presented as part of American society. No one in this movie has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this movie you will see her singing "Lover" and "Just One of Those Things" wonderfully. Danny Thomas is quite trustworthy and he acts and sings the part very well. The comic routines could have been omitted. Yes, the movie is schmaltzy and sentimental, but it's worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.
