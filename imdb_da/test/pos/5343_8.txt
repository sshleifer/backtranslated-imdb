The people of Aardman have made a cool, sweet and wild adaptation of their short film by Wallace and Gromit to the length of man and his dog, inventors, who seem to have more intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case, they have invented a machine that can capture all the rabbits eating the crops over a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to Victor Quartermaine's chagrin, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his confidence rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to be successful with their machine, but Wallace has a mix: a machine he is made to get more food suddenly crosses with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /> <br /> Much of this is about so much glowing fun that a child's movie can ask for, but it also speaks to its oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, which in turn is debt to much quiet sound and comedy. Granted, Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a bunch of more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It is never less than amazing to see how they put the stop movement into use, even when a joke or a gag may be a bit on the fun "ho-ho" not fun "ha-ha" page (a tired criticism but I " You will say so). The curse of the disguise seems so good on all fronts for the audience, in its combed history and sudden dips in the exhibition (Golden Bullet story is a doozy), Park and Box and company never lose pleasure in the material. <It is fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely out of the wall for the kids (even the very young will love adventure and weird gadgets, such as the Wallace truck and Gromit driving around in) and for adults there are small barbs of funky, absurd tones in the middle in a classic English farce. Only (and I am probably a minority perspective here) in relation to the chicken run, it is almost a little work - there is less plot than there are a number of running gags, and of course lots of sayings involving rabbits and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like Fiennes voiced Quartermaine). But when it hits best, it is one of the most entertaining movies in 2005. It gives me a great fat smile when on TV.
