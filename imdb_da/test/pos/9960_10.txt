A few thoughts before I get to the film's heart: 1) I have never seen so many just breasts in a movie before, shown in so many non-sexual scenes - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You charmed us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you went away for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Okay, I'm a college English professor, I've read this game many times, and that's probably the best movie version I've seen of it. While individual aspects of other productions may have stood out, this is the overall package put together well. Pacino is no Olivier, but he doesn't have to be, so come over it! The movie's movie is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts. Venice is amazingly decorated and you get a sense of being really there. Portia's residential area is amazingly beautiful and the lighting is always toned the right way for the scenes' appropriate moods. Anti-Semitism in this movie / play is hard to see, especially at the end. Pacino lowers his knees and hugs his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment on his movie since * The Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter is shot down at the opera). Is the game anti-Semitic? Of course. Is * Othello * racist? Of course. Take it to what it is: a comment on the era of the Elizabeth era, not a comment on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underutilized in the movie, but still a pleasure to watch. The women in the movie are okay; No one really stood out here, but they mix well with the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two juiciest roles opposed to the end. I've always felt that Irons was undervalued (I still get chills when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
