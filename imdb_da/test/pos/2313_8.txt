I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only fun but so much fun, I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I've always felt that it was a really bad movie, but maybe it's because I watched it on cable. I'm planning to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at, but more important than having a good time watching it well. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the movie, and I especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in, and that is no exception. This movie deserved a better fate than it received, and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs Holly. Who wouldn't? The characters in this movie were the kind of guys I could identify with when I was in the military and zaniness was accurate. Nice going troops.
