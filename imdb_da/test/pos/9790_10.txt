Bobby and Mikey are two little boys moving across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Immediately after the family resides, their mother marries "The King", who ends up being a violent stepfather, especially to Bobby. Then Bobby decides that he will "fly away" from the abuse in his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This movie was hard to see, especially abusing the scenes. It was hard to see an innocent playful little boy being abused and turned into a scared frightened and withdrawn young man. The action is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried throughout the last half of the movie. There were some fun scenes in it as well as Monster Brew and the dog who finds the pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I don't suggest letting young children see it. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really flew.
