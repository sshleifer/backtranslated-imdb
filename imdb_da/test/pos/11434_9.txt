As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, we come here again, Amelio, and take on the task of making us the gray area in the midst of two worlds of solid colors. Damaged by the security damage of globalization, the pessimistic vision of Europe is reciprocal with Chinas. <br /> <br /> The views of the charming but eerie country are dealt with below, without the need to learn or impose opinions. The reality is nonetheless tough. Abandoned and exploited children, hive houses, backward areas are the OTHER CHINA we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steel mill technician, is one of us. His journey to China is a pretext for understanding that learning from the inside is a country where progress and third-party problems live together in a notorious balance. It is not clear whether Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component had already been corrected, I think so; nevertheless, it is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole movie. She has many difficulties on her back, she has the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with a little money and a little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and impartial view of the facts of the girl, denying Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A pack of banknotes cannot come back to her husband, her baby (forced to treat as a stranger to the law), protecting her with mockery. Liu knew that his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity act. Their friendship is beautifully told how it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable heritage to keep. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are amazing, either for the actor (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or at the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railroad). In addition to careless editing and a rather lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is brilliant and sharp just because they are waging the incredible values. <br /> <br /> In competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, there are plenty of bets on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni award, dedicated to new stars. She definitely deserved the price. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
