This is not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so I do NOT recommend you to read this review if you have not seen the movie because it does absolutely ruin A few surprises for you. In a way, a narrative of two sisters is far from the original, at least from a purely superficial aspect. Part of its iconography is taken straight from Ring or Dark Water, while the story itself (especially what Burned Sponsor calls "rubber reality" aspect of the story) is reminiscent of films like Fight Club (lead character interacts with a person created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternative reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacobs Ladder, and virtually every movie under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus Amenabar's film (The Others, Abre Los Ojos) , Memento (especially with regard to the torture of memory), et al. Fortunately, all these similarities do not detract from the overall emotional impact of the movie, and I have personally found a speech by two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. Many have commented on the "confusing" nature of narrative, but I personally found the story to be quite self-explanatory, even though it is partially portrayed in a non-sequential manner. The narrative only becomes confusing to some because the story midway through the last third shifts from a purely subjective attitude (ie, Soo-Mi's skewed view of reality) to an objective, with a backlink at the end explaining the origin of Soo -Mi is nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The shift in focus is required to throw some people away from guard, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of the aforementioned Mulholland Drive (although we are not dealing with a character's perception of reality through a dream, but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something that in turn reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway. To be honest, I don't really see a talk about two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at the character's mental illness (and I rush to add the fans of the psychoanalytic cinema will love this movie). Furthermore, the cinematography of A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I have seen this page of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. The performance is also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more of the four main players in the future; Not to mention the music, but then East Asian films seem to be few and far between these days without a good soundtrack. It is very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two sisters and simply dismiss it as "another Asian horror movie", unaware of its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach. But each looked at their own. If you can ignore some of the movie's bulky aspects and simply take it for what it is in the heart, that is. An extremely tragic, heartbreaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.
