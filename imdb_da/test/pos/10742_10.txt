"Kramer vs Kramer" is a fantastic drama about an unhappy woman who is going out on her husband and young son. The man must now take responsibility for taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then the mother and wife turn back, and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs Kramer" has lots of drama with some amazing pieces of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first best actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most say that his performance in "Rainman", who won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that movie, but I disagree that it's his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career in this movie is. The scene after stage shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American players working today. He is also fun at times. Also giving a great performance is Meryl Streep, who was not as well-known when she made this movie as she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for the best supporting actress) for her work in Kramer vs. Kramer as wife and mother trying to find their way to their family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and so far he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also nice as a family family. She also received an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). "Kramer vs Kramer" is a great movie from start to finish. Writer director Robert Benton has made a movie that is completely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
