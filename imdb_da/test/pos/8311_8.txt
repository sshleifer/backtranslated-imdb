His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventure was a founder of summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not boast the latest special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of children wanted from a movie back in the middle of 70s. On Earth's Core Catches is the right tone for the appropriately named Burroughs' pulp adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underground world of Pelucidar and struggling with his evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time, the dolls have gone in favor of men in monster suits, which is much more fun if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you are not there, it is always Caroline Munro's division to look at. Apart from what may be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an annoying but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who ("You Can't Immerse Me, I'm British!"), It's Easily the Best of John Dark-Kevin Connor- Doug McClure fantasy adventure, surprisingly well-directed and boasting an atmospheric use of color. Alan Hume's photography is not very good in exterior scenes, and it is hugely successful in the control that a studio set gives him (the movie was shot solely on audio tracks) to paint a luridly vibrant world worthy of a pulp novel cover. Not high art but definitely great sat matin√©e fun.
