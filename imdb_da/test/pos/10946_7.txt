This movie, which my Chinese girlfriend briefed me on, has two well-known Hong Kong pop stars. Although this can make the movie a simple marketing stunt, I found the action acceptable and they are both cute. The story is pretty bad overall. However, the vampire features and weaknesses are used in humorous ways and created some unique entertaining bits. The scream between the two girls made me grill, and it made a nice balance with the well-illustrated action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
