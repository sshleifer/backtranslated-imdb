Since the plot as Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession until the point of Peter Chase, which reminds Bernard Herrmann's sounds, this little gem seems to be the sight of few. Remarkable game by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris depicted by the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD is the French and the English. Directed by a controversial artist such as Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a small tribute to the cinema masterpiece. It's a French movie, and like all of them, not for everyone, we could say a d'essai movie theater. Although not so published, it can be remembered for several reasons.
