At first, I did not like the way that the director constantly changes from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the crazy asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story, even if it took something to get used to. Danson is excellent as the title character and edward fox make a wonderful villain. The worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife. She has never been Hollywood beautiful and in this movie they make her look exactly dowdy for some reason. I never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it doesn't add anything to the story! Plus you'll stifle her to be so stupid in believing the lies the bad guy Bates keeps telling her. Even her son can see through the bastard. Still a good show and I rate it B +.
