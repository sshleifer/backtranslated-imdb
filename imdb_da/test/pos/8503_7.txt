So Dark The Night presents a tough challenge: It's very hard to write about it in any detail without destroying it for those who haven't yet seen it. As it remains quite unclear, it includes virtually all. The film will hit those who are familiar with its director Joseph H. Lewis' better known titles in the noir bike ?? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, even my name is Julia Ross, who in short looks like it ?? as an odd choice. <br /> <br /> First, the French countryside serves as an environment. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with Surété in Paris, decides for a holiday in the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he finds himself in love with the inkeepers daughter (Micheline Cheirel), even though she is engaged to a coarse local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist, so she agrees to marry him, despite the differences in their age, which inevitably becomes the city. <br /> <br /> But on the night of their engagement party, she fails to return to the inn. Soon, a hunchback finds its body by the river. Her jealous, trembling lover is the logical suspect, but he is also found dead. So anonymous banknotes threaten more deaths that will happen. For the first time in his career, Geray finds himself stumped. <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script all but does the movie; it plays like poor Cornell Woolrich crossed with the murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis makes this creaking vehicle proud. He takes his time near the beginning, but then the story ?? and the story ?? gain momentum (ak, only when the script breaks an axle). Burnett Guffey shined and photographed the film with an exciting search engine to peer out and look into windows; There is also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer who gave responsive to many noirs. A lot of talent has become lavish on such a dark night, but eventually it boils down to not much more than a gimmick ?? and not a very good gimmick on it. It's a one-trick pony of a movie. <br /> <br />
