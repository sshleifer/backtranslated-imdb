I mean, let's face it, all you have to do in modeling is for pictures. The judgment is so over the top with its criticism. However, the show is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and the supermodel himself Twiggy. I've seen season 5, 6, 7 and mid season 8. It looks like American idol gone sexy, but I'm a guy, and I'm just looking because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be pretty boring when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on again, and it's really off-putting. Anyway would I recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to enter the modeling industry? None.
