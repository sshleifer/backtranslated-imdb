Just a good soundtrack. Really fun music. Excellent cast, good leading performance. Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left behind by integrating the blame, or by the departure of the protagonist, the neighborhood is disintegrated. <br /> <br /> This film seems well-researched and extremely well-built. I especially enjoyed some of the little characters like Jeffrey Wright. The cut during the opening sequence helps to express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that the nightclub would have been with jumping music, food, drink, dance, games and sex.
