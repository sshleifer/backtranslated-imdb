This young filmmaker has a talent to capture his audience quickly with unusual camera work and scanty but intense scripts. The concept here to combine animation with live footage is remarkably well done and the soundtrack is very good. The decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts directly on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to invest in buying each upcoming episode. I only wish that all the film images had this kind of commitment to keep their audience entertained in their stories. Recommended.
