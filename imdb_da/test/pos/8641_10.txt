Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to destroy as it is to explain. <br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his twins "Twin Peaks". As Lynch enthusiasts know, his style and vision is uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism and parapsychology ?? with a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor cast in good measure. All of these items are right at work in 'Mulholland Drive', making it easier, hairy and extremely satisfying movie experience ?? especially if you are not overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical mystery-raging whole. <br /> <br /> The movie features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, starring young women whose lives cuts in various ways amidst a Hollywood setting that is in itself a hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro 50s nostalgia and satirical self-reinforcement. Their seemingly random first meeting takes place after the film's opening scene, where Harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a past, not to mention horrible car accidents. Staggering down the hill from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two archetypes of Hollywood's main streets), she finds her way to the very opportunity that Betty (Naomi Watts) is subleting from her 'Aunt Ruth', an allegedly successful actress, there is out to Canada to start a new movie. As we later learned, Betty had even arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug competition. <br /> <br /> An extremely energetic and stylized flashback to the competition creates one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that hit Betty's descent from the cliché would be the star greeting bright eye innocence to the perplexed madness of the confused love and go nowhere bitart actress. Can't remember his own name, the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (In fact, Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose opportunity we really are in is a good question to be resolved in the future.) Still, Betty decides to help Rita find out what happened and for discovering the source of cash rolls and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's bag. The two women begin to piece together clues that seem to lead to Rita's true identity. Incidentally, they become lovers, at one point radiating such a fire chemistry, that I cannot remember its equality in the ordinary treatments of lesbian love affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be termed "mainstream"). <br /> <At the local Winkie's restaurant (a recurring location full of dream-like meaning behind its eerie realistic façade), Rita's attention is captured by a waitress's name-tagged 'Diane'. This leads her to a memory of a person named 'Diane Selwyn' whose occasion the two women soon visit and on Betti's insistence break into. I don't want to reveal what they find inside, but that's enough to say that scene is reproduced with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita shrinks in night sweats and speaks Spanish and hurries Betty to an all-night magic show / theater called 'Silencio', where art of illusion and lip / instrumental synchronization is practiced with manic intensity, and where Blue-haired Lady, as she is noticed in the final credit rules as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-painted, red-haired Silencio Theater, does the blue-haired lady have the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol of the artistic imagination? rather as Stevens' blue guitar man who filtered through surrealism. Under the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo, it synchronizes its own powerful Spanish release by Roy Orbison 'Crying'), a smashing epiphany arises when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously fits the key in Rita's bag. Although we do not delve deep into Freudian's sexual symbolism on purses, the moment is a unique Hitchcock, as matching the key and the box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of sign language and meanings. Not least of these conversions is the discovery that Betty is the sought-after Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (ie Rita). Camilla is again a Latin femme fatal movie star to whom Diane is responsible for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and more significant to whom she is emotionally subject. After these and other discoveries in the last third of the movie, the problem of counting the first two-thirds of the movie is not as straightforward as that of 'Vertigo'. While bits and pieces of image style and dialogue indicate that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from Diana's coveted subconscious, other pieces and pieces may propose perhaps the supernatural intervention of a cast sign that draws direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks', including Michael J. Anderson, representing his eerie dwarfish powers and a Bob variant hanging out behind Winkies and being the ultimate archive for the blue box and its id-like associations. <br /> <br /> But one fits the pieces together, but the whole 'Mulholland Drive' is much bigger ?? and more mysterious ?? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on an amazingly imaginative, provocative and pleasantly disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's filmography is amazing, the soundtrack filled with atmospheric atmospheres, the amazing play and the direct / edit masterful. This may well have been the unknown best picture of 2001 among major American publications.
