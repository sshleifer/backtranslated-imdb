Everyone is entitled to an opinion. The only critic who counts is yourself. I think it is a good movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack" Rodney Dangerfield is fun but uncomfortable. He was asked to make the successor, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the pun of "less is more". He is fun, but a man with real family problems, a more rounded person. It's not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. In fact, in some points, you feel sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when his daughter goes out to him. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack, and in general, a good sorry. A good end to the series. <br /> <br /> In the television show "Alf", Alf says he was crying in the "Terms of Endearment". Wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says he cried on "Caddyshack 2".
