When I first heard about this movie, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films in the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to lose, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was amazing. It was true, love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxury, no money and sometimes no food, but they were still happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but they criticized all my tastes and called myself names because the movie highlighted two minor naked. I think it only made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great and it will only show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert
