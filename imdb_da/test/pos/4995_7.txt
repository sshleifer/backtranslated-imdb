I think consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent TV miniseries: it's okay, but it's far from "Lone Dove." It is compared to the latter simply because this is a preaching on the famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely worth a visit for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect to be as intense as "Lone Dove." Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as how Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two guys. Some say it is unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison, but you have to compare it - it's the story of the two leading Texas Ranger characters: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae." <br /> <br /> The main difference I found was that this prequel is sometimes much slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women). Still, I didn't mind, because the two greatest women were beautiful ladies and generally sympathetic and pleasant people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie."). They helped make this long movie tasty. If you've seen pictures of women in the old west, then none of them looked half as beautiful as Cardelini and Banks. They were a joy for these male eyes to practice. Maggie's son "Newt" was also a wonderful child - the kind of boy every parent would want. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character I thought turned out to be "Inish Scull" played by Val Kilmer. As in the Western movie, "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the view from the leaders. "Scull" is really an original if I've ever seen one: a weird guy, yes. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the supporting actors here did a good job, from Keith Robinson's "Deets" to Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump." I always find Studi to be fascinating no matter what role he plays. I wish he had had a greater role in these miniseries. One thing this movie has in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: the landscape and the photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to see. We also have an excellent director of this movie: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another excellent TV vest, "Crossfire Trail." He also made two of my other favorite films, both based in his home country in Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." Unfortunately, although I enjoyed it, "Commanche Moon" is not as good as the above mentioned movies. You still looked at it all and was sorry it ended if it made sense. It made me see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says this is 360 minutes. It must have included the TV commercials. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
