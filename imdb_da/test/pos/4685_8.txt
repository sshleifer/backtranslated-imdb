A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with Mini Coopers for the first time, and I remember very much like it. Now about two years later, it was shown on television, and I just wanted to know if I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Now the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a team of robbers who will do a last job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and will not have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is a problem they did not consider: A person within their own ranks does not like to split the foliage, but wants to keep everything to themselves, even if it means he has to kill the rest of the crew. But everything except one survives and they are out of revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and eerie plan to steal the gold and revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story itself is of course not very original as it is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has lots of goodies to offer to make you forget it. This is a typical heist / action movie, but it is definitely one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscape and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is ok, and the special effects are amazing. Even the actor is very good, something you don't often see in an action movie. I have to admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5 / 10.
