This should be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and played to the limit of an excellent Miller and amazing Carlisle! Sharp gentle, excellent tale and no Hollywood polishing; a completely submersible film that you are allowed to do for the evil ones! Stott again excels as the awful chance, while Liv Tyler really beats his other, lighter ideas as excitement-hungry Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be known to you by name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear so that the football or seen any television action sequence is probably familiar with it, especially because of Craig Armstrong's "Escape", which must never allow him to work again! The soundtrack of the first game may seem out of place in a costume drama / action / comedy, but a new show shows that it is perfect at home in giving the script the drama. My one gripe about this movie is that it doesn't appear enough on TV! Where is it? Really excellent, sharp and elegant - you won't regret seeing it - again and again! (output to turn on DVD player!)
