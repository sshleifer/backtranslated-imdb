The only thing that can be said to run outside of time is that it is an incredibly smart movie. It is interesting to note that the film's authors are French, which can explain the film's "out of the norm" vibe, as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly called "Hong Kong Cinema". <br /> <br /> The movie relates to a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using an equally clever policeman. But first, he has to convince the police to join his personal crusade, and then a series of games begins, where the thief manages the policeman in his plan. <br /> <br /> Quite a smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review of this movie or full length reviews of other foreign films, go to www.nixflix.com
