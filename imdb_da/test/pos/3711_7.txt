This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a brief story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and about 8 seek bird eggs (of course, a giant collector's item for boys in the south) around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decide to catch up. He gives his prize egg to his little brother Willie and heads off with wanting to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie doesn't have any of that, if Pete can be a soldier, he can. He leads to Memphis and shows his stubbornness and determination as he gets the best of more adults along the way. After finding the enlistment center in Memphis, he demands to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process. We are shown a little brother's affection and love (Jonathan Furr). He delivers an impeccable performance as a stubborn, heavily-wanted boy in the milder times of yesteryear. The film tries and mostly manages to show how brothers can show affection and the importance of family ties in one's youth. As the two brothers reunite for a short time, the film delivers a cathartic shout as the brotherly love encloses all of us. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cold bottle of water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good, clear water with a tasteful mineral pack, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. Yet it quenches your thirst and you have no doubt about its purity and extinction. It is more run of the mill and cheaper than some, but gets the job done and leaves a refreshed and charged afterwards. 10.7
