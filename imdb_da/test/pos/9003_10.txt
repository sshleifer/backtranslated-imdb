First and foremost, I know almost nothing about rugby, so even though I found the rugby aspect of this movie to be interesting, it could have been some sport, and I think I would have enjoyed it just as much. The fact that rugby didn't make it better or worse for me. What made this movie fantastic is the story itself based on actual events that have taken place over the past 30 years with the Highland Rugby Club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the kind of coach that most parents would most like to have their children, one who cares more about the person than the sport (although they have won 17 national championships and only lost 9 games for over 30 years!). The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this movie and its message. I have seen other sports films that seemed to be pretty first, but then I only examined the details to find out that most of these films were 10% fact and 90% fiction, where 10% of the facts are greatly exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may seem too good to be true, but that's what is so amazing about it. If it were fiction, it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more. Instead, the movie is inspiring and makes you a better person. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews of professional critics. I have read some of their reviews and most of them have given the film horrible reviews. These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate. In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics had given the film good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and write your review (positive or negative)! Currently, most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thanks!
