Many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular action, casting and styling of this movie. It seems that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the central moral issue (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This movie is, carrying the final scenes, carefully emphasizing Ramon's belief that he is not doing any big point, but just for him is a life without dignity a life that is not worth living. We see as seers an enormous dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for his physical limitations, a life lived to the full. Central to this movie's tragedy is that there is only one person who believes that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and say that the only counter argument comes from a bumbling priest's visit is a fog. The priest's visit is pure farce, a direct attack on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's answer to the question of euthanasia. However, the sister's farewell words to the pastor immediately expose the powerful 'pro-life' feelings that quietly support the entire movie. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's argument, but we are never united with his decision. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a movie that moved me and provoked me as much as this.
