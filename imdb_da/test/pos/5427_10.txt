'The Big Snit' came into my life completely by accident and left an indelible mark on my soul. A scar of love, destruction and meaninglessness that will forever be a part of my life. This is the story of beautiful contemporary. We are helpless without each other. We are helpless to public offenses. We are helpless with the choices we all try to make when in love. Deaf to mutterings and goings on a world outside the window. Blind to an inevitable apocalypse. Stupid of hatred and greedy opinions of a surrendering society. This is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love that defeats war ideologies. Their petty bickering is a strange observation of human nature and of how love comes with the pain and darkness. Everyone has some annoying aspect of their personality and this is complied with by the creators in the simplest and most amazing way. We only travel a short distance with the two main characters, but we want to finish our own travels with some of their simple, loving, honest philosophy in tow. I am so glad I exist in this 'our time'. Another 20 years on both sides of my birth date and I wouldn't have seen and felt .... .... The Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
