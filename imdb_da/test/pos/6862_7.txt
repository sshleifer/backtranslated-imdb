I found the movie pretty good for what I expected. Although I am tired because I have a fear of injection needles, I came as expected when they came. So if you're not in needles, blood, the human body and some good medical fun, put this movie back and hire another. As the other user commented, I also liked the German attempt at a slasher movie. I am an American who just moved to Germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say this is a place along these lines. A sign falls into places and feels misunderstood. While trying to dig his way out and find a truth for a situation, things get a little sticky and others are not so sure she's on the right track. So in the whole movie, you keep an eye on who's anatomy, you can catch a glimpse of, and who rounds off the next corner.
