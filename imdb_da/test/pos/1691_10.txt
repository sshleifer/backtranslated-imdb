There is one of the best films directed by Andrzej Wajda that the story told of a young writer searching for him after another war (he survives German camp). Excellent true atmosphere (action goes to displaced camps), main hero (played by one of the best Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski) falls in love, but unfortunately his lady has been killed. It was a beautiful scene when he speaks to American soldier and says (about death his girl) "Nothing happens, simply you shoot at us now ... his state of soul has been destroyed. 10/10
