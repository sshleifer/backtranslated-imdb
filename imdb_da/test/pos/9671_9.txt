Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has made a show that is witty, culturally sharp and just fun. <br /> <br /> For those who think it is "offensive" to take on social or cultural issues, there is no meaningful comment, just causing "offense", may point to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): How long was I in there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why don't we finance this?!? <br /> <br /> Why yes. <br /> <br /> Thank you family guy, to be not only the funniest show on television (with the possibility of exception for the much-loved, much-missed futurama), but to be pretty clever to start.
