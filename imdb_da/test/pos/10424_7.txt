This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Lots of nudity / sex, but without the overall raunch you usually find. They couldn't have done a better job in casting, as the whole ensemble was great. Trust my guys if you want your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together, and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I would very much like to know. The photography was much better than normal. So was the story. Predictable but nice, sweet natural and romantic. At least it was not one of those annoying predictable killing mysteries full of bottled women with big fake breasts. I give this 7/10!
