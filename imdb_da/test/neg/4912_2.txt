Emraan Hashmi post MURDER did some good roles in the Bhatt movie, but other directors just used his kissing and naughty picture. <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them, and it came after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row, and I was the movie having a good twist at first, I felt like an Abbas Mustan movie, but then It turns into a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climax <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a horrible movie. Music saves grace. Camera work is fabulous. Emraan Hashmi just repeats his act of his previous films and has 2 expressions throughout the Dino look stiff, speaking as if he is practicing Hindi and doing it okay in some scenes udita is expressive and annoying
