This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters in an ordinary family in 1968, seen primarily through the eyes of the youngest son. <br /> <br /> Based on historical events such as The May 1968 student uprising in France, the derelict Franco regime, the war in Viet Nam, the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to the Spanish life at that time, one can consider this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles that makes so obvious in this kind of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it seems to be generally treated in a lightweight vein but not missing at certain moments that can be called dramatic. The series seems to be aimed at people of about fifty who can rember the times it should be said that any younger one either chooses to ignore such happenings or is obsessed with other things. The best thing to say about this series is Ana Duato's role as mother of three children: she plays that part of the overall housewife of the times really well and manifests the peculiar Spanish love, which is especially visible among women, to let all her thoughts and her actions are conveyed by the heart of the heart without resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little except to be his usual stereotypical hard policeman as in other TV shows. In fact, as an actor, he should not trust anything that is not a television series. His resources are too limited; But his part as the father of the working class household is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Not really advisable to other audiences, even Hispanic speakers in Latin America: The themes are far too parochially related to a particular place in contemporary Spanish history, so that if the viewer did not live here at that time, he will miss them most of the references. It is even likely that certain situations that cause a few Spanish smiles would not matter to other viewers.
