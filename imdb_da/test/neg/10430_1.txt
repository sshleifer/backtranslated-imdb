After watching the DVD release of the Blues Brothers and their mention of "Wired" at Belushi's cinema, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information about John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but didn't know too much about it and found it far behind at the local rental shop. I understand that Dan Akroyd really was over this movie, and I thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light. But it had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts okay until they run in John's body to the morning house. When he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run for it, it begins to faint in this movie. John is subject to seeing his life and all the turmoil he created with "Angel", a Puerto Rican leader with a bad humorous sentiment - subjected him to criticism and attempted to make him cross. <Br /> <br /> The two actors who portray John and Dan do not see anything even distant near the real actors, (let alone others who are related for that matter, ie Lorne Michaels), makes it hard to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in reality ... but it's the top of the iceberg. I think this should be an "artistic" movie - John is constantly being plagued by drugs (ie powdered soap in the bathroom is cocaine) in such a way that it was also difficult to follow. Flashbacks are choppy and also make it difficult to understand. The most tasteless scene was probably when John (literally) was forced to undergo his autopsy and has pain while removing his heart to weigh it, saying it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yes, we get points without the grotesque depiction. <br /> <br /> There are very few other players we know of in the movie (where is Carrie Fisher for example? They were incredibly dense and Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show) it looks very cheap , (we felt it looked like the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s), it felt like it was filmed in a week and didn't even show John at all at all. I felt I knew a little more about him from watching episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> On one last note, Bob Woodward comes across narcissist by placing himself in the movie and arguing for John to write his life story. For a person who was to be very highbrow about the bust at Nixon, his personal calibration could match any author in the National Enquirer and thus lose my interest in some of his work from that point forward. <br /> <br /> SKIP THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more on John, watch his movies, watch the clips of Dan Akroyd talking about him or hoping that someone has the taste of making another movie on John, following the "Man on the Moon" line, which In the end, what we expected. I think it was a "moral" kind of movie - you don't know, doing drugs, but I suppose the creators of this movie didn't understand that his death made a number of people (like Carrie Fisher) stop making drugs completely out of it reason.
