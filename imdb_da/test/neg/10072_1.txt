This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours in my life. From the opening 10 minutes I was ready to leave. The cliches that hit you in the face and the plot were not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than Swiss cheese. I'm considering suing for the lost 2 hours and $ 6.25 along with the fact that I'm now stupid to see this waste of movies. T-Rex has to turn in their graves, so to speak.
