Before rejecting my post as "not getting it", let me say ... I'm one of the greatest Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone" fans out there. Donnie Darko is one of my favorites all the time, and I even thought Southland Tales had its moments. I'm a huge sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see "The Box", couldn't wait for it to come out. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me to Hell", it was the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it just won't stop! When you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you're out for more torture. I actually stood in the theater at the end of the movie ... I could hardly take it anymore. The biggest problem with "The Box", no matter how you cut it or try to justify it, is that it just makes little sense. Believe me, I "got it", I understood what was going on. But that doesn't mean it makes much sense to look back on it. Take the basics for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, play Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses his finances at his job, so his husband notes that they are "living paycheck for paycheck". Well, then sell it that Forsing Porsche your husband is running so !!! They live in a beautiful 2-storey house in a lovely subdivision. Marsden works what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA, and Diaz is a well-educated teacher. And yes, Marsden runs an overly expensive car. But are they somehow living paycheck for paycheck? You don't have to press the button, just cut down your expensive lifestyle a little! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead, they are apparently desperate for money ... constantly living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what's going on, but it still makes little sense! It is a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments of movie history (terribly acted by the way). It was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to describe it fully, so I'll move into a subplot involving the alien's nosebleeds and body possession. (Yes, I'm seriously sorry). A child is in Diaz's class with an evil and smile on his face (an eerie smile that apparently goes completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at school). He starts asking Diaz's personal questions, which literally embarrassed her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the child at all ... he was not even asked to stay after class for a chat! Diaz is at a party ... and the same child is one of the hired help ... ironing shirt, apron and all! I don't know many foreign-owned children (who seem to be in Junior High), who also moonlight as a gown on parties sponsored by teachers and school staff ... but we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the child comes and goes ... no real explanation about him, no ends his Grade. Moving on ... A lady approaches Diaz in a grocery store and tells her that experiments are being run in secret, and her family is one of the subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if foreigners have powers where they can take over a body externally ... and foreigners won't help Diaz ... who took over this lady's body and gave Diaz advice? ! Again ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and foreigners were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling his body? Never explained. Never spoke again. No nothing !! It goes on and on and on like that, for what it seemed to me, 2 weeks. It wouldn't end! I wonder if this movie went through a massive resumption at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there a minute, the next. Signs started but never ended. The many detentions of the release date clearly show the problems producers had with the finished product. It's really a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Pass this ... There is no redeeming value in it at all. 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it still deserves a 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
