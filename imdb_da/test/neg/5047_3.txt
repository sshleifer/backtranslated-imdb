I don't think I ruin anyone's experience of this movie by telling you that you don't see it if you have something better to do than clean under the oven. It gets dirty under it and you have to clean it once. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence, even though there is a cargo stunt that looks so dangerous that it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "Gargoyle's heart is in the right place, but its ambitions are conservative. At least it is not pretentious. But I had a good time shopping for it, and played the perennial idiot in the horror movie saying "What's in this hole?" and die for his hubris. And I met Michael Pare. Each movie junkie must work with a B-film staple at least once before death. And the Romans are the most beautiful people I've met. Literally the most beautiful. Walk down the street in Bucarest: if 7 out of 10 women are not quite beautiful, you walk down a street I didn't cross; and be comforted by the fact that at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinks. Part of the film was shot in Casa Radio, an abandoned, unfinished Classic Communist Bloc-Cum-Georgian Nightmare building originally designed to house KGB propaganda ministries, ie. Radio Not-so-Free Europe. The building is five storeys high and takes up a block of buildings; Best of all, while the fa√ßade exudes the Big Brotheresque State solidity, it lies near the city center as a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and many wild dogs. Building on Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were performed on television in 1989, and there are still gaping holes falling from the sun-drenched top floor (offering surrealistic views in a modern quarter-mile stretch of beta roof, decorated with beam and old car parts overlooking a crumbling old town right down to the humid, creepy basement (which doubles in the movie for the Gargoyle lair.) No American style shines or warning signs for Bucarest. Since the death of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has hosted several non-professional film shoots including "Highlander III". It is attractive to manufacturers because it is a cheap location, massive in terms of scale and free space, bizarre appearance and free of insurance headaches, as it is still state property. Plus, no complaints if you don't clean up your production: Everything left on the site is interpolated into the resident gypsy's construction of their shanty city in this actual city jungle. <br /> <br /> An assistant director was bitten by a wild dog under the "Gargoyle" slider. The apples provided by the catering were squeezed in the service of cast and crew as projectiles to keep the prowling dogs in bay. I was also bitten by wild dogs in Bucarest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two car wrecks for two weeks, both in taxis, and none of these were seen by the drivers involved as a reason to stop the cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: The Sci-Fi network or channel or anything was one of the backers in this movie (the smaller the budget, the more manufacturers are set), so it's a little weird that no one had trouble with the original title "Gargoyles" until it was almost time to show it on the network, although Sci-Fi already had a non-related series of that name. The title was changed once relatively close to the release as I have a color-corrected copy marked with the previous title.
