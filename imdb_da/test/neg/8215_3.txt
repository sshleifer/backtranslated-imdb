** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The protagonist, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and mortal that he may have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks to his own hallucinations and sees all uninvited on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute serve Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Unintentional laughs are provided by the giant "Nubian" slave Mantis, who speaks with a deep south accent and helps the Sade chase three-passers in the style of THE FAR FUNNY GAME. The Sade's bile wife, ravaged by leprosy, gives some really scary moments when she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helpless chained prisoner. (This scene was seen on television by many children who carried the memory into adulthood.) The almost normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-disobedience to a science. ("I used to be a nurse, now I'm not much of anything.") She and Fallon are planning their escape and ultimately an enemy meets more horribly than the Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more capable of drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (I would say so much to Mr. Boyette - he shows his fixation with infection here as he did in his comics.) It's rather like an Andy Milligan melodrama minus the meat slots. The wardrobe of the period, library music, abuse of the disabled and all-round misanthropy make it surprising whether Andy was not called as a consultant. But Milligan made better costumes and wrote a better dialogue. Technical gaffes are too many to list here, but you know that this flick is in trouble when you see the opening ship, which looks like it was shot in an aquarium. Also, a movie made in Texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the red look it deserves right. Fallon's first encounter with the leper Countess is really awful as it is the movie's farewell. If the rest were half as appalling, HARROW DUNGEON would have been a terrorist classic. Instead, it's a fun piece of schlock that trash fiends will love for all the wrong reasons.
