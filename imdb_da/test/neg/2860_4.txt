Child's Play made a new scary genre, THE KILLER DOLLS, Some of these movies haven't got too much money to do it, but I think the only movie that shadows Chucky is this. It is a typical product directly to video or directly to television, but Pinocchio is not real, and the killer is the little girl. The child's imagination is too great, and this movie plays with it. The roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
