This was a cartoon. The reason was not so hot when it was there, but the signs were interesting and very well-behaved. The story focuses on the Travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. That's what I say solved because the story is mainly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father were to have the story focused on him, he edited the movie rather badly. The action on all parts was very good, especially Emile Hirsch as the surviving, confused son. The characters were all very interesting, and I didn't mind seeing them late in the movie, as it just seemed to pull. <br /> <br /> My big complaint, however, was the story. The son who killed himself should be the center of the plot. But it really wasn't. It was something that happened in the beginning of the story, but then everything went every single way. Then they would mention that the son killed himself to remind him that it was the central thread. The other thing was that the large plot twists, of which there were plenty, were never explained or built up, but just thrown in there randomly and often from the far left field. In fairness, the ending was very, very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (half that not padded) was largely lifted from the story in the Pearl Jam song Alive. Who reminds me of ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie allegedly written by someone who killed them himself. I could not have been the only one who acknowledged that the poem was being lifted, word by word, from the same song. I was not a movie I had hoped for and they really really dropped the ball.
