****** Spoilers within ******* What a boring, predictable, non-scary snorkel party. The film had no sign development: I felt no empathy for any of the characters (except perhaps the little boy), and didn't care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many klich√©d bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was so predictable. Many times I will say to myself: "Let me guess what to do next?" Yup, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I told you that the "attack" on the family was by some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure enough, that's what happened (of course you have to wait 79 minutes to find out). And of course another "evil man" scenario. Why was he evil and killed his family? Because he's a man, duh! As someone else said, this movie may be scary for anyone under the age of 13 or for a 1970 movie, but it is far from being a scary movie by today's standards. AND like many other crap horror movies, many were scary "fakes". Scary music, scary music, scary music and ..... A wreath suddenly flies to the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old bank guy go a few times across an open party without the father seeing him? I thought the old one was a ghost. No, just a crappy movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie a 2 out of 10 because it made me aware enough to sit through the whole thing.
