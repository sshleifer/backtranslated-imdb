To begin with, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But newer movies let me wonder, is he trying more? His latest movie shows almost no effort at Seagals. In out of reach it is too obvious that his lines are called over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not just a blow to his fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second stage or so, as he prepares for the zip line in the drugstore penthouse to steal jewels and money, it shows him that he is setting up the gun and hooking it to a neon sign. You might say to yourself, 'Yes, what does Van Damme do?' Now it was stolen by a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the order. Hire both, see both, compare both, and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was today you dying garbage, but it was, I dare say, an insult. Seagull's Aikido movements are still good, but why he doesn't make movies like Market for Death or Over the Law, he still has the movements and attitude, I'm just wondering why "Why Seagal, why?". There are such idiotic scenes in his recent films that have nothing to do with history, and such idiotic story lines beyond that. I hope the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially Today You Die, made me really wonder if he has things to do more good action movie as Double Team. Please do not watch this movie unless you hate Seagal if you love his movie does not see this, it will question you his future in the action movie genre.
