If it is considered a standalone function, I cannot say it is too bad, but from where I stand this successor and the original "Lady and the Tramp" do not agree with each other! They are two completely different films with different styles, different voters, different stories and about the only thing they share with each other are the pictures (eg, the townhouse Jim, Dearing, Lady and Tramp) and none of them have changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for any continuity year after the release of the original for the memorable songs like "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel will not give you any at all! Almost every song has a little pop for it, and the good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats can be seen, but they seem to be somehow replaced by new characters, Not to mention Peg does not appear at all if votes are quite annoying. Even Lady and Tramp do not often appear enough and for Scamp?! He is so spoiled! And treat his father Tramp with utter disrespect, then run away with no regrets even after hearing how much he is missing at home! And they called their shameless escape an adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf really brought out the fierce bad boy in Scamp out of the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters just drive you into this; Trustworthy sounds like Guffy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-dum-Bennett) - and his VOICE - don't sound Scottish or worth hearing! Zap him as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the stupid, decapitated, EXASPERATING JUNKYARD DOG !!!!!! Someone put them down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "Lady and the Tramp 2" is not quite bad if you do not already have a hard day, but I expect much more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy, so is his girlfriend Angel and there is a weak history. I still think you should try it at least once because, as I say, there are much worse movies around.
