I love documentaries. They are among my favorite genres of film. Before I watched this movie, I hadn't seen one that I didn't want. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is a fantastic one. The execution is well done. There were some times when I laughed and smiled. But when the film became more boring and annoying, it became. This could have been something special if the subject was not so unnoticed, childish, scary putz. I greatly appreciate his passion for movies, but I finish you. If you have short money, you may not have so many children or spend so much money on alcohol. Maybe you should have gone to the film school, or at least graduated from high school. Perhaps you should have lived life and gained perspective and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, fun and exciting. To see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing short of crass. If you want to make a documentary on a film producer, why not make one on anyone from China or Iran, a movie producer with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes a small child to see Apocalypse Now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
