Many years ago "MA2412" tried the feature film to be a kind of "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope nobody outside will ever have to see this. Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom, it may be interesting to see which director Sicheritz made of his series.

You can see how difficult this is by seeing "MA 2412". The result of this experiment, in my opinion, tastes like an infinite television episode (and not a good one). It fails to deliver a plot, humor tries too hard, and the control seems very unfocused - as it applies to the visual style. So summarizing I would definitely not recommend this ...
