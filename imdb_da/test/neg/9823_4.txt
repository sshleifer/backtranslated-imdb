Hellboy is about classic cartoon / action / superhero genre story lines. Basically, Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is raised from a child of a priest and a governmental community and has chosen to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural, rather than being a threat (the normal career path of a demon). <br /> <br /> The history of the story involves creative uses of the story that combine Nazi experiments with the occult. It's confusing, but it's also the whole idea of ​​a demon streaming around the streets. I find the explanations of the signs, who they are and how they got to be very well handled. The sequences are on point and very entertaining. In fact, the opening is the best part of the movie that lies the problem ??. <br /> <br /> Important Del Toro, who both writes and manages this piece of bottles it. The movie is absent from any excitement or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible in the first action, and the rest of the movie consists of scenes where any conflict is automatically rather crass because we inevitably know Hellboy will be ok and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action / movie. Well it is, but when we are drawn into a well-made action movie, we cannot help but feel the hero can die. Die Hard works because John Mclane is likely to die on all parts. He escapes death by the smallest of the margins. Stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc. ?? Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far better than the hero. The threat and voltage are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of hiring deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and appear again as their skills are needed within history. The villain is mentioned in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Unexpectedly and unexplained changes. In one scene, Hellboy seems to be opposed to a real threat (groups of monsters) a character releases her abilities - the screen falls to white and inexplicably, the monsters have died, but everyone else lives. A minor character established in an annoying and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the film's ending. Her character is so thin, the relationship is so undeveloped. Clearly, she is no more than an attempt to push the plot together and make it all sensible. I do not want to ruin the end of the film, but essentially a character that is dead, miraculous and incredibly brought back to life ??. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from poor dialogue and a liners that are just It is not smart or fun. After a while everything starts to grill. <br /> <br /> What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired images. And the one who made the creative decision to make Hellboy's primary weapon into a gun instead of his clunking arm was to be fired. In essence, the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film and destroys the fighting to nothing more than a one-sided shooting. The few positives are: The camera is very good. Still, a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker color palette. And the use of interesting places. But maybe it's a bit the same. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and FX is well done. We never get an overload. When effects are used, they are used well and realism is the team. Rather, it looks like Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the over-effects we often see. All in all, it's a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has many instantly seemingly fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has the toughness, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it may be worth watching. But in another situation I would not like it.
