Forgettable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important for this movie's plot, but Rob Estes plays a hunky cop who happens to be Nostradamus for some reason and who is struggling with timed medieval monks running around with weapons and putting people on fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yes, there is also a sexy FBI agent who happens to be a pyschic and tries to get Rob to believe in everything before it's too late. Too bad they could not predict a better plot. Grass. <br /> <br />
