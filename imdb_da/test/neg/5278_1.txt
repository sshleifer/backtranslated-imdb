I have seen many - possibly too many straight-to-video, no budget slasher movies and have developed a taste for the "good" or those who are less sucky, as ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, is what I want to refer to as ... absolute crap. Nothing about it is fun - the play sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, the gore is minimal ... and sucks. It's about a group of colleague friends running out to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the children. It is supposed to be a relaxing retreat, but they only know that a deadly sick, former plastic surgeon who has gone badly with his two female assistants, is looking for useful tissue to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper as he drives a motorcycle and of course chops. This is just a horrible movie, not worthy of some time. Enough said.
