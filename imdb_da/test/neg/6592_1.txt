You might suspect that the plot of this movie was written during movie recording. It begins as a "punks versus vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the movie the plot is changing when the vigilante becomes an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and must fight for the corrupt "businessmen" who want to beat the gym at any cost to build a mall or something. Then the plot changes again and we forget the corrupt guys. The villain is now the leading man's friend who thinks he's a ninja. The guy becomes "crazy evil" and wants to win a martial arts match at all costs. Watching this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on.
