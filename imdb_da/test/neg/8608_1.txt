.... so why on earth would I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I've seen live and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual cartoon that manages to maintain extreme oafishness. Crook I only know of the greatest comedy in the last 10 years with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. Like Gareth, he was simply fun, and I was interested in how he would convert to another sign on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So I and my boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night, and the movie was a lot of fun, just because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and scare Ferris and Dave had been provided with the aplomb and enthusiasm of the talent Vegas and Crook. They're destined for better things (have made it better already infact) and I even think Vegas would make a decent straight actor. The trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came close to touching, though ** SPOILER ** dressed in the stage at the end, when he was taken back by his wife, had to be extended, it just wasn't credible. And throughout the film, Vegas only looks to miss his wife 2 or 3 times. The film was grotesquely uncovered and plain old, good, grotesque when sex was mentioned. I do not add when it was displayed on the screen. Tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwich and why wasn't even a bit of fun and made me feel a little sick. Also completely unnecessary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy picked his nose before he showed a close up of bogey on his finger. Only he picked his nose would have raised a smile, he was a pathetic character, and it would just have made him look as low as possible, but showing the twist close was just not necessary and was straight. <br /> <br /> One scene I thought was fun with sex was Vegas in the tree. His blokish conversation with the other blocks just highlighted the fact that threesomes are always endless ecstasy. Not what I wanted to know ..... <br /> <br /> It's all about what I really can say. I will end up with this and that is actually my main criticism of the movie. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. It's not a 'Trainspotting' that's for sure .... it's not even a 'Love Actually' (you must have a heart of stone not to throw up on one), and 3 million pounds could really have been put in a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a wonderful little known British comedy and was made for far less than 3 million. I only hope that BFC will learn from the 'Sex Life of Potato Men' and not be so free in the future. Although the terrible reviews this movie is about to make, it is only increasing the cash flow. :-)
