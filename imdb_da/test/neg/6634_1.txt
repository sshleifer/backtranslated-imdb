First of all, this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to watch it. I flew through channels one day and stumbled upon this miserable excuse for a movie and it confirmed what I have been saying for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor and is not fun in the smallest sense. He seems like he is a great comedian and thinks he orders the public's attention. Honestly, he has a 10-year class clown play that is less than a 10-year-old's ability to compare them to Carrot Top would be a serious insult to their good name. This movie tries to be fun using boring one lines, all of which seem to have been lifted from the 50's cartoon. In the end I would have done something to delete my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories are with me. All I can do is warn others to never see this movie. But the evidence of true carrot top does not work worth a marvelous.
