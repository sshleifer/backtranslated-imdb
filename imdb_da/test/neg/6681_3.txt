I became interested in this movie because someone had made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rk's "Bachelorette" with clips from it. So I saw the movie. And it's actually stuningly beautiful. An animation masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, history does not continue. It starts off with interesting plotlines about people who faded for Rose Bride, but suddenly lifts lifts with water and loses their walls, people float away, and finally for no reason is the Utena tranformed in a car and a highspeed chase ensues. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of Anime for its ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you want to watch this movie, turn off the sound, it's better that way.
