I felt compelled to write about this movie after I joined IMDb because I thought it was the worst manuscript I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The movie / acting / other areas of the movie are amazing. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty drills were also there from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they sound this script out of the wording process? I thought not only that the plot evolved like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (I can call it that) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go demand a refund from the box office. I have never felt so played and used from a movie throughout my life. Here I was expecting something that looks like the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, great plot) to only find out that they had taken my 8 dollars and made a mockery of it. <br /> <br /> One part that still makes me feel that this movie has now received more than $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> In summary, I felt this movie offended my intelligence. I still feel that the only part the authors focused on was the tiny bit with Julia Roberts, who acted as Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
