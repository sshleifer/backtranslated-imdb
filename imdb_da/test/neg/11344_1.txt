I am a regular reader of Kathy Reich's Temperance Brennan novels. As such, I am very surprised that she even heard about this show. <br /> <br /> It's EXCELLENT compared to the books. The Temperance Brennan character is in the books a peanut that regains alcoholic and divorced mother of a college aged daughter. In 'Bones' she is an arrogant (rhyme with rich), which in typical P C-mode is not a mother. The emphasis on her helping staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is quite contrary to the books. <br /> <br /> In all its deterrent to the PC movement, she depicts the enemies in the United States as peasants (!). Some of the information is not even correct, for example, having a sign from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan an Arabic? I am sure that if negative references were made to "disadvantaged minorities" or women or GLBT, the show's producers / writers / directors should apologize. But in the typical far left, all races go to the highest upcoming minority group. Asia, like David Boreanaz 'Agent Booth, constantly refers to Angela Montenegro as a' bias'. Forget the stuff and forget about this show. After the "The Man in SUV" episode, I thought I'd try another episode to see if it got better. It only got worse! I don't even care if that teenager was murdered or committed suicide and I don't want to see the show ever again.
