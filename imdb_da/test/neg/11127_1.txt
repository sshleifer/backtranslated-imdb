OK, if you are a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have fun with this. Otherwise, it can really be too painful to see. Plot: Obsessed with cryptozoology and sneaking a large box containing a Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it by customs or even mentioning he is carrying aboard a living animal - "no, it's research equipment, the vents are just an accident"). Some dipsticks he employed to let the open box and expect that he paid lots of money, maybe there's something to steal. When WOOD CRATE is open, the Chupacabra breaks through the steel beams and goes on a killing rampage. <br /> <br /> Whatever. <br /> <br /> With a random stroke is a Marshall (I assume an American Marshall when he was in the Gulf War, not just a guy named Marshall) is on board and examining some money that went away from the ship safes. He constitutes as an insurance salesman ("Madam, I am the best insurance you have ..."). Other scintillating characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and unfortunately his dignity is the first victim of the movie), his Tae-Bo instructor daughter (Snicker - Tae-Bo), an annoying old stuck-up lady with a small dog to be fed to a cat (guess what it eats ...?) and an incredibly uncomfortable gigolo that may have been credible in a movie made in 1964, not in any newer. Much of the actor was really bad and the characters were just there so you can laugh hysterically when they died. Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad at many levels. BATHING BATH BATH. What??? Bullets don't even make Chupacabra flinch, but Tae-Bo bimbo can beat him and scare him away ???? Hey Sci-Fi Channel, you are desperate for scripts or what?
