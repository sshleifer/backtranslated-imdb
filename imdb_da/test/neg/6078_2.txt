Let me start with a personal note like movie and TV buff, more on the enjoyment side of life: I love what James Woods can do and have done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this terrible, miserable, smelly "true crime" essay. Who really wrote this movie apparently never spent time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: Yes, some thieves are junkies, but they have very short careers as twenty. Really successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not "junk" or any medicine before they go on a score (job). The James Woods character was true to this paradigm at the beginning of this movie, and then the script slipped completely apart. He turns into a violent, alcoholic, lunatic .... good work for a high-spirited guy like Woods, maybe, but not at least trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this movie are beautiful, self-defeating, narcotic narcissistic losers. They couldn't avert a real score in the real world, the real world, where a big and gay security guard who beats the living hell out of a thin child (as it happens in the early stages of this "DOG") keeps him knock down and don't let him up. Ever. How many ways did I find to hate this movie? Many. Even completely vulgar people - like most sneaky and junkies - have a larger vocabulary than these cretins. And 'rip-off' scenes with the Nazi cyclists? Puhlease. All the rednecks are not neo's Nazis, and those who are Nazi speed negotiators are just not stupid! <br /> <br /> This movie earned a second because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has 'something special' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensive stupid movie . I'm not one to sing praise for real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that they all would be dead or in jail by Act 2, Scene 1. To see a miserable zombie -film would be time better spent than this .... thing ... and i hate zombies.
