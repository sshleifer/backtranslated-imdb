I think this is one of my top ten worst movies I've ever seen! There is like fading out every two minutes. If this was on TV, they would have an example every 2-3 minutes. But there is one set I have personally had: It is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man to see and for about 10 seconds you see his whole body without a towel! It was the best scene in the whole movie because you see sasquatch starring on them, but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. Plus, most of the deaths are off and only screaming or roaring. And I expected Sasquatch to die. But he doesn't shoot him, and only 4 or 5 people die throughout the film. I expected 8-10 people to die. Don't watch this movie. I give it a F-. Do not waste your time.
