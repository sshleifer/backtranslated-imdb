Creepy catastrophe mash has a team of scares that come across the enclosed S. S. Poseidon, hoping to plunder it before it goes down well. Irwin Allen's successor to his 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure" arrived at theaters seven years later! Don't worry any more, why give us such a creepy production, full of obscure characters and miscast actors, to just ruin my biggest hit? One might end up feeling really sad that Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones were not for their lost sea expression (good for a couple of crooked laughs). There is a moment when saintly Jones is tempted to take some treasures to herself, and she begins with thinly filling her pockets, which is an unintentional hoot. The movie was a career bungler for all concerned, especially Allen, who never quite got out of this. * from ****
