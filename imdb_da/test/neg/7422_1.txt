(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Inexhaustible, profit-free and above all sad waste. You know a movie gets bad when the only star force is Lance Henriksen. The French title for this movie says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you possibly make a movie this incredibly bad in this day and age? Whatever Jonas Quastel's trick is, it worked. This is Ã¼ber-trash, I speak 'Manos' level crap, meaningless, upatchable, not just as bad-it's a good movie of the highest order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen Is Harlan Knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't as complete with no traits or personality. He goes along with a lot of morons on a field trip to search for an evil Sasquatch, who is believed to have attacked a plane crashing into the forest or something. Not much else happens. There is some soft core (meaning: Teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs of "Predator". After 92 minutes of pronounced pain and another torn scene, this time from "Blair Witch", the movie finally comes across the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we only see the monster for about one or two scenes throughout the movie. There really isn't much to say about this movie. All you need to know is that this is a very bad movie and not even worth looking at as a "so bad-it's-good" flick. "The Untold" is to entertain value what Orlando Bloom is that character acting. Avoid it like arsenic.
