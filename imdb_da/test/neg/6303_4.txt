Shaggy, friendly but frustrating movie has the same old message: if you want to do it in this world, it is not enough to be imaginative, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living off the (heterosexual) rules who control us. Australia's comedy drama drama competition is a most optimistic journey of three male friends traveling over the Outback in their pink bus, Priscilla dubbed. Although there is no formal movie in itself, there are the obligatory "road movie" sequences (tie at the fire, facing down rednecks, etc.). Writer director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially transparent moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are grim gaps in his story, a gloomy plot about a gay man's relationship with his former wife and alienated pre-teen son (both of whom are pleasant and the child wise - with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy at all. It has some evil transvestite humor and a pretty game cast, but a script that seems to have become the water along the way. ** from ***
