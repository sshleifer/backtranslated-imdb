I've seen this movie a couple of times and I never really liked it. I'm not a fan, so termed "now horror" so I can't be fired on that account. I found it a little dull, I think what annoys me about Hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not sex, but you are sexploitation. I am surprised how many people have rated this film so high that I get a new look at it. But for me it was not scary, it had no atmosphere, just a little "omigod, look at the bad / stupid London prostitutes, and the little innocent Anna will be raped by yet another unpleasant man, here!" In the end, I assume for me that the film had no depths, just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value. This was undoubtedly to some extent what the Victorian England was, but the sets are even too lumpy and boring giving a feeling of Victorian threat. Roger Corman's horror on the other hand, now it's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me, it was just exhausting, flat-felled waste.
