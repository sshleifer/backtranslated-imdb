I did, and I lost two and a half hours in my life that I can never regain again. <br /> <br /> I honestly have no idea what the critics and the fans are seeing in this movie. And it's not because I can't appreciate "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant filmography and good direction. <br /> <br /> This movie is just not one of them. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it is so terribly slow, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, the sequences of the dialogues go too fast, and there is not enough exhibition to let people who have not read the book know what is happening (my mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I saw it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes, you'll be treated to a black screen without music and waiting for the current movie to begin. <br/> <br /> In the following one and a half minutes, several pictures of sunrises and savannah landscapes are seen. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishment shot three or four times. The next eleven minutes are preoccupied with grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight a little more, pommel things with a bone. Probably the prehistoric men whose development is affected by the monolith's song. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we enter the room. Only to be exposed to twelve-minute ships that slowly spin to the Blue Danube Waltz (a rather quick pace-edged roll that I understand, but here it is quite disturbing). Finally, we get a bit of innocent dialogues and a rather cryptic exhibition about the government that does not allow people to land on the moon. We wonder about this in fourteen minutes Blue Danube and spinning ships and nice camera tricks with anti-gravity. Next comes four minutes to see a ship travel over the moon's surface and dock at a space station. We get a little more exhibition in a board room scene that follows. Then we are outside traveling at the snail's pace over the moon. Another monolith is revealed again to fill our ears with the horrible ringing (I didn't know it was an actual piece of music!). The monolith makes its small light show and the plot jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes to see the ship for Jupiter's journey. At this point my brains had become mush. Can it move any slower? Perhaps it is "realistic" to portray it as such, but we still do not need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to understand the concept of "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like to see people die, but because after five minutes I was just as annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I should like this character, feel when he dies! Instead, I found myself waiting for blissful silence, no matter how it came. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now we come to the most interesting part of the movie - the part with HAL. Forget the Dave stick-tree protagonist. The real star of the show is the cold impersonal, chillingly scruffy, reckless, relentless, bad guy of a computer. He's amazing. And the "open podbuk doors" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it is not long before the director goes back in too long. <br /> <br /> Four minutes for HAL to die. And he does die. Slowly, painfully, loses intelligence with every minute, the voice becomes lower and slower, sings "Daisy, Daisy", all with low and constant elevation, which becomes as annoying as the great breathing. of flying colors that Dave enters into the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing, but a guy knocked out the psychedelic version of space travel again with the triple damn chorus! We got the idea at the start of the sequence! Why pull it out so long? Unless he wanted to get LSD users to go psychotic and have flashbacks. I won't even try to explain the end, mostly because I don't understand it myself. He is apparently in a foreign research laboratory, and they teach him deep and deep things as he looks older and older, and then sends him back to earth as a sort of cosmic heavenly space baby. None of this comes across in the movie. For all you know, it is just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot at all. A lot of the movie felt that way. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried to watch this movie, I passed halfway through. The second time I passed through this evil excuse for a movie, it was to help my sister see the sequences to see how long they lasted. It is so boring. <br /> <br /> Call this crummy movie "art" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I never expose myself to this kind of suffering ever again.
