While the David Lynch version of Dune is choppy, awkward and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well-acted. The best thing can be said about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to make Dune a miniseries that it is ambitious. In fact, it's almost the only positive praise you can offer. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least possible emotions and the least appropriate accents. The costumes appear to be designed by a person with a large excess of the Mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headgear. In some cases, these miniseries suffer from the shadow of Lynch's already known efforts. However, it takes elements from Lynch's films that were not present in the novel and almost copied them wholesale (ie Guild Steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages encouraging negative comparison with Lynch's film. A for effort. D for just about anything else.
