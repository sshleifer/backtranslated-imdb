Here's what's good about "The Battle Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse are all performing well. As always, Gosling is pretty pretty outstanding. The sites are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here's what's bad about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything else. Scripture is terribly confused. And although I can certainly appreciate a "not good" movie, this movie is just boring. Big performances can't make up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script filled with cast lines that often don't even make sense. Just getting through the first hour was a task. <br /> <br /> I stole it because of Gosling, but eventually I did myself a favor and changed the channel. Spoilers here relayed the end to me. I didn't miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good Gosling flick, check out "The Believer." My score: 2 out of 10.
