Poor editing, poor production values, poor continuity, untrustworthy, poor dialogue ... these movies are bad, bad, bad. But if you want a movie to throw fun on (a la MST3000), this is your movie. I don't suggest spending much money on it, but if you see this movie, make sure it is with lots of witty, like-minded friends.
