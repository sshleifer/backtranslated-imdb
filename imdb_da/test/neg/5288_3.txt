Dr. Chopper starts shortly after the teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) mother is dead, he is still cut up on it, but every cloud has a silver lining and in this case his mother seems to own a log cabin at the Tatonka Lake itself 'friendly place for happy people', as she did not tell him. So Nicholas with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) & Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) head out for a fun weekend. Unfortunately, things are not in line with the plan, and the cabin turns out to be a little more than a drive down and their neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) and his two nurses who kill and kill someone they meet to use them in horrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> Going directly to video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn & this movie seems to have a hard time here at IMDb with some pretty hard reviews while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror movie is pretty worthless, I don't think any of the criticisms I've read are justified. The script, which takes itself very seriously, is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who plays a role in the movie as Detective Crocker according to the IMDb cast list, although I can't remember any character of that name Maybe he was one of the police in the beginning? Still, the basic principle is okay, although it is a bit boring and lasting too long, it is typically slasher fare with some kind of vicious figure running around and encountering our annoying American teen you know the drill now. Besides a short and undeveloped nonsense that Dr. Chopper uses body parts to refill his own exacerbated body, there is not much history here and the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their peaks away, there are the inevitable sex scenes that are a sequence where some girls must complete a sorority house initiation topless & there are even a few lesbians here too, one of which is seen without her full compliment of clothing. Oh, and when I say topless, I mean they have no peaks, but they keep all their breasts on, so you can remember that there is no real full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper at all. So there you really are, it is an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end, which is wasted, is populated with a bad cliched stupid character that exists only to showcase some inexpensive bra scenes and girls. To be honest, I expect a little more from my movies, but then again I might just be pushy. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn does really well, it's not at all the worst looking movie I've seen even though it still looks cheap. There is no style here, I didn't think it was scary and there is no atmosphere either. Gore is maintained and limited to some dead bodies and separate limbs, there is nothing new here or any particular convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions and motivations are ridiculous. Technically, this is a little rough around the edges, but it is reasonably well made on what was probably a very low budget, the forest location is appropriately insulated, although the police office looks like something in front of the room and the two nurses outfits in the beginning look like stripper outfits . The action is okay, it may be better, but I've probably seen worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper actually has a doctor who runs around on a helicopter motorcycle, but unfortunately it just isn't enough to satisfy me, even though it's a reasonably competent production, the lack of genuine gore, nudity or a decent plot drops it without trace.
