This is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap. Nothing is scary here, and the film is almost bloodless. Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct as in a television movie. This is not a completely bad picture, I can safely say that I found it quite fun. But a lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo". All in all, if you are part of the regular audience and pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" are your favorite, then you will love "Voodoo", but if you want something very cruel, avoid this movie.
