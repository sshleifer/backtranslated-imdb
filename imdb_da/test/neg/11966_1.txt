The dedication to the local sports team involves taking beginners to the grain fields and guessing what? There is a scarecrow killing people there. Only one of the newcomers survives, but falls into a coma as a result of diabetes. Meanwhile, scarecrows are beginning to kill all the people involved, one by one. What are the scarecrows secret? Will they find out before scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK, but the picture is really corny. The plot / script really sucks and is quite pathetic and not logical. The action is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. Can't really say much about the special effects because there are not so many, but the few there are from bad to OK (for a low budget that is). There is some nudity and that is probably the only thing worth watching in the movie (it's if your a horny teenager, if not, skips the movie together). Another complete waste of time and money so don't see it. Also goes to hack'n'slash fans.
