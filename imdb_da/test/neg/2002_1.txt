Don't waste your money on this apologetic excuse for a movie. The only way I could see someone watching this is if they are a drowsy fan of Erika Elaniak, but you'd rather surf the internet than to see this piece of shit. I'd rather see paint dare than go through to see this. <br /> <br /> They lure you into Casper and Erika and lead you to believe it's a sci-fi Dracula movie, but it quickly turns out to be a farce about Van Helsing's magnificent (you get the point) grandchildren, here ironically, for a last show between himself and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I think, when it seems that none of the characters in the future know who God is, they have not been taught about him and not understand when they see a cross. Could have done much more with this idea. It's a shame, it turned out like it did.
