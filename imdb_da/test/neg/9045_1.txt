Umberto Lenzi hits new downs with this recycled paper. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her sister who is missing it. It turns out that the sister is part of a Jim Jones-type religious cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her come to the cult of the jungle. This is another (!) Kannibal movie, and I would have liked it if it wasn't for Lenzi who paddled this movie out with scenes from his superior "The Man from Deep River." I think every cannibal scene is lifted directly from this movie, which I think makes him as credible as Al Adamson. I felt ripped off. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and it's for the dildo scene.
