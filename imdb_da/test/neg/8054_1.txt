Terrible is really everything you need to know. First, think of all the things that could be bad about a movie. And then try to make a movie that is bad in all these ways. You will have made "Vacationland." The state of Maine should feel offended: it is far too good a place to serve as a backdrop for such a tired, mindless, boring schlock. I am romantic and I always want to have movies about two people who find each other to succeed and I tried hard to find the good in this one. It was hard; very hard. I couldn't find a glimpse of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in humdrum dreariness. Except perhaps in one or two of the evil ones. <br /> <br /> Maine is a great holiday country; This movie is not.
