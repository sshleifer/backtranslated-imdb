When Kristy Swanson gets an assault on the blame for what she does, she wants to go out. Unfortunately, Madsen is her closest manager in a company where "giving two weeks notice is not an option." As a teenage killing vampire, Kristy did a very good job. The valley girl picture seemed to fit. But as an assassin on the run ... Well, continue running Kristy. Run, run far away! This movie is not a concept that has not been done before, but it has been made better! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to see the rest of this movie, but I felt I should if I wanted to report this movie. I always wanted Madsen, and his character was a little predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to see and do ... no wonder it was never released theatrically!
