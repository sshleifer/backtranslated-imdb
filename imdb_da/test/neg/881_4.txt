Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the kind of end I get really angry with ... Let's just say it's not my cup of tea, just like the dim shop is not my cup of tea. <Br /> <br /> The reason has a doctor in an inn and meets a woman with whom he has a deep but short affair. He goes out to meet his foreign son, and she goes back to her life. <br /> <br /> Well-acted and well-crafted filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. These are the things associated with dime great romances that make women wander and the men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be so negative for the movie as a mindless romance, except that the movie takes a ride in the last coil that is so out of the left to be absolutely incredible. Why should certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, give it a shot, but wait for cable.
