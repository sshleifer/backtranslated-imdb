I don't want to spoil it for you. Although you could probably care less if it was spoiled (you know what I mean when you see it). Bad story. B-rated film quality. Typical horrors - stupid situations - rare timing. I should know when trying to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add "quotes". Just tell me that the movie bombed a lot of time. And they are trying to pull into everyone so they can break straight to cost this bomb. I wish I could go back the time I spent watching this. I was stupid and thought there was just something good around the corner. But I kept being let down. I don't normally waste my time adding comments to any movie. In fact, this is my second post. I just felt that I could save some of you from wasting money on something that had a lot of hype on it.
