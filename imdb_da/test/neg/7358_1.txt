If you looked angry, another mediocre ghost movie, then you need to know what to expect, just worse, much worse. This time, instead of being in Japan with all English speaking people, we are in Spain with all English speaking people. Interestingly, not one shot of this movie actually resembles Spain and could have been completely filmed in a studio's back lot. Oh and a place with swings because there is a good 5 minutes of shots with no one on them, oooohhh, how creepy. This one is horrible in every way imaginable. The actions of the lamellae mother and father do not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who delivers a decent performance in the movie, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my own private hell watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a good moment in the movie when a villain tries to explain the envelope plot to Anna Paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a lot of stupid questions and he knocks out "You IDIOT, you haven't understood anything! " laugh out loud. Well, I understand understanding this movie is a piece of waste. 0 stars.
