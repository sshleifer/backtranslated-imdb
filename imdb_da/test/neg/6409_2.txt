What the hell was this? I admit that there were some scenes that caught my eye like the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates number 23 everywhere he goes, but it was pretty much the movie in a nutshell?! To cry aloud it was supposed to be a thrill movie and be labeled as a psychological thriller I would have expected to have at least a catastrophic effect on the mind, but instead what did we get? We just got something as sloppy as an animal man who finds himself in the midst of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. Could like an old man if you ask me. I should have just rented Wild Hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. I mean who we are kidding, they should have made another killer of that girl. By sitting with Sparrow with the main character in that book. The number 23 they gave pretty much to the viewers by suggesting that he was the killer all the time. How would it have shaken our heads? Shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity to this miserable job you call a movie and kudos to most critics who voted for my response.
