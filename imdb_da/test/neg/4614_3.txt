Okay, I thought it would be terrible. But when I saw it, I was proven wrong. Emily Bergl did a fantastic job as Jason London. Sue Snell was underutilized and signed. The masks were ok, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely stand-outs. As for the things teenagers do and how people claim it is all wrong. No matter what. My friends and I use the word "swank" a lot, and I have driven a car and had some controls that I changed. It's pretty much everyone there. I have never been to an after-party party in a big house with its very own light show. The deaths are good. The best thing is a pair of glasses, a spear gun and a pool .. all in that order. I have to say there will be people who hate it ... but I'm not one of them.
