This is undoubtedly the most ill-considered film in history. The invention's yarn at Carrot Top is some of the most horrible attempts to be fun in recorded history. I'm not familiar with her other work, but if it's half as bad as this, then I just have to cry. I give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars, and God must have mercy on those responsible.
