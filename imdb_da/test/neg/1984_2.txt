This movie is sometimes called 'The Story of O-Pt.2', which attempts to transfer as a sequel (of varieties) to the French erotic S&M thriller 'The Story Of O'. Although I have never seen the original version, however, I got to see this boring sexual and social policy mixed bag. I assume that the O-angle comes from the occasional S&M overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to see) as those in 'Mistress'. Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French / Japanese production (but speaks his lines in English - at least in the version I saw.) The unnecessary use of surrealism only makes this a boring example in pseudoporno even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove by portraying a piano that floats in water?). It is obvious that after the entire "pornochic" trend of the cinema was exhibited (1975), the producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel and try to enjoy the adult cinema, not to mention foreign / Art Cinema, so movie players have to fight with "The Last Woman" and others like it.
