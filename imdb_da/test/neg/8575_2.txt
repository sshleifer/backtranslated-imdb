I do not usually comment on what is acting in a movie because it is the only thing that people who have the agenda against a movie will follow. In this movie I will make an exception. The action in this movie is below average around. I mean halfway into the movie, I wonder how the hell produced the producer and / or the instructor about casting such an ensemble of people who can't act. Although the production value was good, the bad story just complimented the bad results of the actors, and there are even half-hearted attempts to twist to the end of the movie, which ends up being confusing. Are all Spanish horror films disappointing?
