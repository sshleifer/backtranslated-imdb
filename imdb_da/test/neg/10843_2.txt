Ben Affleck, who is getting married, is shaken by a plane crash and becomes involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, who is compelled to act crazy). Who is to blame for this outrageous, ugly morass? It is so poorly edited when I looked into the credits, it was not reading the editor's name - it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clich√©s, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in the raccoon eye makeup, the film is not even worried about creating chemistry between the two main characters. Drawers are non-existent: the scene in gay bar with Affleck could have gotten a big laugh if it wasn't so stupid (the bar's borrowers - a big, robust bunch of them! - shout for Affleck to strip and start digging out their cash ). It should have no other meaning than getting Ben to loosen a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong and the result is invisible because the idiot editor cuts off ... or was it the whole movie he had? It is a small moment, but it is typical of this movie, an amateur piece of pop music that wants to be an edgy modern comedy, but has no gut. It is tailored to the bottom shelf of your video store. * from ****
