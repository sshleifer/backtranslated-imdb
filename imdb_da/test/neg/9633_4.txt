Strained and humorless (especially in light of his rather dubious psychology), but good pace and comfortable lurid, this lively body film highlights the exceptionally hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman periodically possessed by Jack the Ripper, allowing some ugly doing in the midst of Edwardian propriety. It is all the most beautiful things for Hammer, but is handled with a lot of visual elan, although the central relationship between psychoanalyst Porter and Rees drives the narrative without having been explained satisfactorily.
