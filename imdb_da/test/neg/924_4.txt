When they announced this movie to TNT, I was thrilled. A travesty from Donald Westlake's "Enough" was one of my favorite stories of all time. After I saw it I was not so excited. Recently I had the chance to see it another time with my aunt and once again I was disappointed (she also didn't like it much and she had never read the book). In this movie we managed to sap all the charm of the book and turn it into dull moss. Much of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him in other movies, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes lots of valium for his nerves, but remains extroverted at almost all times, which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also released a great deal of history (except for a 2-second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe does not solve 1, but 4 murders for the police. This is important not only because it is fun but because it helps to establish the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's fraud is ultimately hardly affected, as they do not seem to close. In the book they become pretty good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes it more ironic that he is the one who arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin, but he was not a cheerful, happy to be living optimistic kind of detective, trait, which book Fred possesses, making it more obviously out of character for him to crush with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great even though he didn't look like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene, which was completely added to the movie, was much less interesting than the police found Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent it to Seattle and blamed death on the mob. The kit was okay even though she was mostly rewritten and it would have been nice to see her die as she got a little annoying. I do not mind changes in books to make movies, I know they are needed because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had become more fun or smarter rather than duller .
