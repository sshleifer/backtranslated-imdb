This movie is in a tie with the original for worst movies ever made. I think this can be a little worse if anything. SPOILER ALERT !!! Here, these survivors are on a ship that has been combed for a long time. Unlikely? No - POSSIBLE. The whole premise is so ridiculous that it's not fun. There are some pretty big names in the movie and even they couldn't save this horrible thing. I really find it a waste of good celluloid. After seeing this I unfortunately also decided that it was a waste of my time. Don't bother with this one. Or the original for that matter! I gave it a 2, mainly because they cast votes of 1 out.
