If you are a weirdo who seems to be "romantic" and nice to have sex with a woman who is your mother's genetic equivalent, get her pregnant and then have sex with her again when she has had an abortion and does not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> Never mind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and regrettable that he has no conscience what he is doing He can't do right at his job his family, or Maria. He's a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it's boring and incestuous. <br /> <br /> It moves slowly and it does not lead anywhere during the first half of the movie. I couldn't even finish seeing this pathetic excuse for a "romance". I'm glad we didn't waste our money in the cinema on this one. 0/10
