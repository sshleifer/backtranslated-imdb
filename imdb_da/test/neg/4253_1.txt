I can't see why everyone loves this movie so much. True, it has good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such a bad script. Woody Allen is a brilliant film producer, but I'm afraid it's only a piece of waste. It is very predictable and the subject is far too visible. I happen to be a great Woody Allan fan and love most of his work, but I can't recommend it.
