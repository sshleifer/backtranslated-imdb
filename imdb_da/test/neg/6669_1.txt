It's a shame that a person who so idolized by many children as well as parents should break down himself into this exploitative, bandwagon jump jump. I often wonder if Mr Wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a movie of any pride. At least, Sally Geeson had the right to retire to do something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget waste. A como of a long forgotten pop called Pretty Things cannot save the movie from the terrible. If you want 60's nostalgia, invest in 'Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush' instead of Barry Evans and Sally's sister Judy instead.
