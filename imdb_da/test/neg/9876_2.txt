I never read the book. Now I don't really want to. I had no idea what this movie was about when I entered the theater. I still don't really know which point it should come across, but I know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. Two precious hours, I can never come back. <br /> <br /> The story was so predictable, it's ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I finally predicted within five minutes in the movie. And I was right. <br /> <br /> The action is not horrible. The only two cool characters in the movie were the British cousin guy and the Rambo graphic novel judge. The other characters are also ... the dialogue is very bland and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of the movie is the transformations between "humans" and "wolves". If you wanted something kick-ass like Van Helsings, you really get bored. Imagine the ballerina, a bright light, then a wolf. Yep ... it's about it. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you have read the book because you just want to beat babies.
