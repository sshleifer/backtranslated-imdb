This is a treat for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will find writing and acting badly enough to compete with something Ed Wood has ever produced. Veteran's bad movie actor Cameron Mitchell is a former makeup man from "Paragon Studios" who, after an unfortunate acid-in-face incident at a social gathering, becomes a cursed Mad Scientist (tm) with a rubber leather on his face, taking revenge by kidnapping Paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his secret lab (tm) conveniently located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies making his bid? He's not sure. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of your favorite movie clich√©s are here. Check out the villain's lab! Are these mysterious steaming liquids fluid? Tested water test tubes without any stated purpose? Yay! And how do we see extra arms and legs arranged a little informally as on a wooden board? You betcha! Marvel at the bumbling detectives that deal with straight out of Plan Nine! Now enjoy a silly tame billiard and hear more dizzy bimbo screams than you might have. Raise an eyebrow on the screwed plot line, made even more opaque by the completely pointless end that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Cheesy garbage can and very fun for the bad movie makers.
