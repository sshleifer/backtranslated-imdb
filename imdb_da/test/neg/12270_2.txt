Even though I saw this movie by myself (luckily), I still felt embarrassed as I watched it. I was deceived to rent it at the front page reviews, and the bloody / gritty camera at the back - which made me believe it was a kind of documentary. These actors are ridiculous in the whole movie, not at all convincing. The story involves an Italian Australian (?) Gang, just fighting with other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeating. Probably they train extremely hard, which makes them far better than other gangs. For some reason, I don't think they could actually beat some of those other guys who are twice their size. I could be wrong ... no I'm not wrong, this movie is not entertaining at any level. Prison assembly looked like it was a summer camp, instead of kids it was a sausage party of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. This movie is not worth your time, save your money or throw it in the trash, just don't play it on this movie.
