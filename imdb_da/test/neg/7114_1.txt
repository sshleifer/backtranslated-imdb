When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are seeing something you've never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie where, of course, they used INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough to act or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that each character is completely over-portrait, and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the movie had become "sped-up" to get the characters moving faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also called?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live action. It just looks strange ... as if the camera's crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors. The English version is terribly doubled, and the word of the character does not exactly match the mouths. I would have preffered subtitles, but since this is a children's movie, and some kids can't read well, I'll let it go. But there is something very strange about this movie. It is apparently a children's movie, but there is a lot of material about SEX, RAPE and STRIPPING, which is not just for young western audiences. (In the Orient, the various laws and sexuality of children's films are much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, several scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insane young Japanese girl makes a sexy dance to one of 'sex maniacs' and shows him his breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are ridiculous. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village, cardboard cutouts (or animation, I wasn't sure) that look convincing even to a child. The actors in this movie released many cool things from the comic book simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they would need. I didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed ... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. I really don't recompeted this movie to anyone. Children, adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a bad representation of the comic book, and of course you will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and that there was no care at all. I don't even want to get into the camera ... just wait for the final credits on the still image that sits there for 2 minutes ... most of the shots aren't framed properly at all, and the movie just seems made by amateurs. Grainy film quality too. <br /> <br /> Just all the way horrible !!!! <br /> <br />
