Although the play was excellent, I spent the whole movie and waited for the unpleasant boy who caused so many grief to so many of the characters, got his final nemesis, and instead led everyone else to him and he got the job with the man if wife death causes him to run away from his friends, win the girl, he handed over and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect fails to return to its cause. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark film that every character that is affected never suffers from depression. None of the normal pathways to relief seems to be effective, and the only thing the authorities seem to do is to release amounts of stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland now, I will never go back, only if I am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up being destroyed as the characters in this movie were.
