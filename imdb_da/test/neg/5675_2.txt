Beats me how people can describe this youth exercise as film noir. True, there is a gun and a bottle & a lady and the manager is a private eye, but that's not what the genre does, folks. This thing plays like reheated TV cop show stuff - lots of bloody battles and miserable continuity - with a dash of Chinatown memories being thrown in. It is quite difficult to look over the first 10 minutes. You want modern feelings, see something by John Dahl.
