... now move on because it comes on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not so brilliant films, ie, the unnecessary "Psycho" remake) started an experimental phase with " Gerry "who reached its peak with the thoughtful" Elephant ". "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new movie, also has great 15 year olds around ... and not much else. Some great references to Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant filmography of legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the film is just too artistic and meaningless for its own judgment. We've had much better upcoming stories, and "Paranoid Park" doesn't bring anything new. I can't see anything artistic about seeing exaggerated shots of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the little girl from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas") playing her cheerleading boyfriend have sex for the first time just because she felt they should do it and after they finished, she calls her friend to say how amazing it was (and you can tell from Nevin's face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start earlier and earlier today, have films like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" (showing how lost the mind generally is, not only when it comes to sexuality) made a better portrayal of it. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the final result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biopic about Harvey Milk with Sean Penn, will hopefully bring back the good old Gus, for honestly this obsession with underage children is almost ... scary. 4.5 / 10.
