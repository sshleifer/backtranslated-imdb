Suburban kids meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is also more vicious and stronger. Nevertheless, most of the action is also bad, as in the first. Sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing. I made a mistake to see this one sober. You will enjoy it more if you are not ;-). If you haven't already stopped loving the clown after the first movie, you will surely go after the other ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problem children and their viewers are on their way to a camp in the woods . And what accident did their car break in the middle of a forest and ..... in the evening? It's just their luck. They find a house, and one was shot, one of the guards stays behind (why I don't know it) and the rest eventually finds another house. In this house a voodoo priestess lives ..... but she is not responsible for Killy's resurrection. Who is it then? Well, look better at the movie and find out for yourself ....
