With the horrible spectacle, the horrible dialogue, the diversity of bad humor, the crazy plot and the horrible movie. This must be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm king to find bad movies. For the effects, they just put false blood on people and things, didn't spend time creating wounds and making special effects something. Most people who make low budget horror flicks do at least something like tissue of tissue or something that makes a gashing wound. The dialogue was far from self-sufficient and the play was without direction or effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said, have it. I swear I have seen better movies from my movie in the class in school. How did it ever get a DVD release?
