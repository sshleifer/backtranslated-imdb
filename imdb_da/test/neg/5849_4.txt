This film got a great write in Blockbusters 'upcoming attraction' I was looking forward to the release date 08/07/02. The reason sounds sensible, the cast alone should have secured a sidetracker, but whoa there; Apart from "off the wall betting events", it was right drilling. <br /> <br /> This will never be a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it hasn't done anything to John Cleese. Rowan Atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a Rowan Atkinson kind!
