What really stood out for me about this movie was how little the plot meant. So many characters were randomly introduced, it was as if I imagined Tommy Wiseau's "THE ROOM" would resume for the Disney Channel set. We had the clever elderly couple who stopped hanging out, "Jane" was working and telling the same story of how "soda" brought them together, or Jane's Mom / Stepmom / random crying woman, all of whom would be random. <Br /> <br /> Aaron Carter's play is surely the highlight of this movie: I actually looked at all the scenes he appeared in. Editing is painfully bad, with scene cuts that don't make sense. The "Jane" character is really annoying, mocking and moping about "J.D. McQueen." The "Music Awards" scenes are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
