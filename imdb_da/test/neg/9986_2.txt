As an old film fan, I had heard a lot about the controversial film CALIGULA rated ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics of some and as one of the most obnoxious porn movies of others. I decided to see it all over the undeveloped version to evaluate it myself and hoped to find something positive that would make the many accusations against the movie right. I sat in my chair one fall and began to see. New Testament quote from the New Testament shocked me a little and raised the first controversy in me ... why include a gospel sentence by Mark in the pagan Rome movie? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music that sounded strange while the credits also provoked me in a positive sense. Yet, the negative emotions in me traveled rather quickly, especially at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not so horrific for the center. In the second half of the film, I felt like I didn't see any historical epic but an extremely obnoxious porn. Eventually I said to myself, "This is one of the movies you can really hate" ... I realize a movie can be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go so far in removing all the flavors. I hate this movie because of many reasons, but especially one. CALIGULA does not serve a purpose with an old epic (as it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims to combine cinema with porn. It is, in my view, the most serious issue to which the film must be accused. Film is an art to be ruled by taste, by message, by some sense of epic grandeur, while this film kills all boundaries of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most anesthetic side of man in the most evil, decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are any people whose psyche is not affected by them. Some say Rome under Caligula's government was so brutal. Yes it is true. Corruption flourished at the time, different sexual aberrations were preferable to Roman citizens. Nevertheless, I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it highlight an old epic. I think it proves rather the producers' bizarre psyche and their strange tendencies ... HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES: The manuscript of Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It can be seen, for example, with the figure Proculus (Donato Placido), a historical Roman senator. Yet the film shows him as a simple soldier, whom Caligula strengthens his most decadent ways of torturing and rape. In addition, Livia was not the Proculus wife raped by the Emperor at her wedding. What is behind changing the stories of historical figures in the stories filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia depicted by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula Caesonia married long after his sister's death. The sexual assault on his new wife in the temple is a fun scene without historical bases. I also hated the moment with the murderer - a pure imagination from the director who has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND CAST: Technically, the film is nothing special. The camera does not boast of being exceptionally fine, and the sets along with costumes are also not outstanding. But the only strong point in the film is the performance, especially that of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the lead role, showing the emperor madness and cruelty. McDowall raises the value of the film. If everything disturbs you in CALIGULA, you can at least admire his performance. I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the movie is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula loved her sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole makes his finest piece of play in the Capri Grotto sequence depicting the decadence and exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is the performances. Therefore, I do not consider the film 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes into poor continuity couples. Let's analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the old Tiberius horrible pleasures. Then, after approx. 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where a black bird near Drusilla and the Caligula bed is a bad omen. And immediately are the signs again in Capri, where Nerva (John Gielgud) dies ...? <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not recommend viewing CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves beautiful novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD, or see Herbert Wise's mini-series with Derek Jacobi's amazing performance. CALIGULA is a sick movie where the most serious crime is the destruction of art. It is essentially a porn movie that should never be called an epic. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty, <br /> <br /> there are movies that are average entertainment; but they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> there are movies showing extreme violence; but they still convey some moral <br /> <br /> however, there are movies showing illness and decadence for their own sake and thus damaging people's minds <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, CALIGULA belongs to the latest group
