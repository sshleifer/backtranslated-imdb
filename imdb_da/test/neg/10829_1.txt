Why can't there be better TV movies made I was in a loose end today and watched this movie on a satellite channel in the UK. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Bad set, Bad act & oh my God, what a terrible flood. Blimey the woman can even run out of water !! I really want people to make TV movies using better effects, better or at least more credible sites and far better plays. Killer Flood is well up there with poor acting. A few pieces of ham couldn't seem worse. <br /> <br /> One final thing I really agree with the comment about the dog, but I think it would already be sharp in real life!
