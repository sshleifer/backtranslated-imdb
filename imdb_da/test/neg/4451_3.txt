A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), who claims to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the 13th torturer in hell, and he wants to tell nice things. He says he had made an agreement with Lucifer to become human again. He had to beat his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day their mother died, and she had to kill six people and hand over the Antichrist, and then he would flee from the gravel and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and violent sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) doesn't think she's a virgin, but their father and former birth teacher Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines her daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile, the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the pastor and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is her tenant's mistress and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila) and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their blood, but she thinks she has nightmares . But during the ultrasound she realizes that she is wearing a monster, and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The horrible "Born" is a B movie (actually a Z movie) that thinks it's a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and horrible action and direction. The reason is a complete mess: there is a priest who is a hitman and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis goes to a psychiatrist a father examining his daughter virgin; two female demons (succubus?) standing naked like a statue with both hands covering their sex; a sign that is a blunt and only exists to reveal its beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the play: The unknown lead character Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Mrs Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying performance. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good performance when I still had the picture of his youth. Denise Crosby performs a hatred and like everyone she gets older, but she is still a good actress. I think if the author and director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B movie, history could have worked better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("Antichrist")
