I think it says something that Bollywood "Bride and Prejudice" remained more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version did. I also laughed more in the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you've read the book or seen the 1995 BBC version (and liked them), you'll be in for an unpleasant surprise to go into this movie then. My friend, who had also not seen, was mildly amused by the movie. If you are a JAE Austen purist yourself or even a movie-goer who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit on it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the script. Scripture was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn't have gone half as bad if they had a proper script, perhaps written by someone who actually loved Austen's work. What travesties were committed? Well, you are forced to endure such incredible lines as "Don't you judge me, Lizzy!" and "Let me alone for once in your life!" Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen's eloquent pencils, but can anyone honestly believe in words such as wasting the mouth of a beautiful young lady from the Regency era? The use of modern colloquialisms is one of the many annoying ways in which the scriptwriter writes the book. The author also decided to give characters lines that were said to be of a completely different nature in the book and all without apparent purpose. Worse of all, when trying to stay a little closer to the book's writing, the manuscript has an unpleasant and unnecessary habit of translating Austen's sentences and replacing awkward synonyms with his already perfect words. It was as if the script writer sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I suppose all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an attempt to remove this movie from the iconic 1995 BBC version. But for me it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work. Casting had potential, even though it was quickly pushed away when the script went in. But Keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth doesn't match charm and liveliness! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him tolerably beautiful enough, failed his script and was under the impression that he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as apparently like a hobo who had accidentally walked into the movie set and I have to say it is an appropriate description. And can anyone tell me why they formed Wickham after Legolas? Even though he was in the movie for under two minutes, I dodged, and without his impressive archery skills to reinforce the movie. <br /> <br /> On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were lavish and would fit in more with the modern century. (A Sleeveless Regency Evening Dress? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, all the budget went to her wages and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole one hairbrush from the movie. Unfortunately, they did not get him fast enough to jaw the actresses' sixties before the film was rolled. <br /> In short, with this new Hollywood version, you bid on Austen's eloquence, subtlety and joke, because you want the complete opposite.
