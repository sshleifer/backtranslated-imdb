I do not understand the exaggerated good critics of this movie, except that many people from Venezuela are understandably very excited, based on the Venezuelan cinema really lagging behind which other countries are in the region. <br /> <br /> The movie, above all, is too repetitive, many scenes are almost identical from each of the two leading roles, giving you the impression that it is a time-consuming one. A timer is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will start to get tired after a while and watch the clock. All actors are pretty bad, except the Venezuelan guy Edgar Ramirez, who brings a little slapstick and plays the role of Venezuelan recruitment "Pedro". <br /> <br /> By the way, it's not a representative movie about the people of the region (caribean zone), it tends to ridicule them.
