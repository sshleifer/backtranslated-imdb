I expected this movie to show up before the election. CBS last shot by throwing a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful, but I'm still looking at it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS got the same people who "provided" the note to do half-cut in half sequence. What's with the bad girlfriend story? Can the play be more constructed, or the dialogue more like an Ed Wood movie. Who ever came up with this script then give us a favor stop writing. If you want to see decent B grade disaster movies then watch Earthquake, Flood, etc. Avoid this mess in a movie. Hint to CBS avoid showing us this crap. Give us re-runs of CSI instead. Better trades and more credible.
