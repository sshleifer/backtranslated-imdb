This turned out okay and looks interesting. But as it does, attempts to create feelings between the characters are so eerie that it really makes horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. The story of this is based on "I went with a zombie" is probably much better, though unfortunately I haven't seen it yet. "Ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it has proved very bad, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong with that. I think there are just too many inappropriate scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, in the love between Alice (called Alice Dodgson as the girl who apparently inspired Lewis Carrol to call her heroine Alice) and the younger brother. Absolutely nothing is built up between them and then eventually they become married. Still, it looks good, and it was worth a visit - but the film is just so poorly done. 10.3.
