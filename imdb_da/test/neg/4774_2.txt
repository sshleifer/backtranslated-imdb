It had potential ... it really did. But there is so much about the film that it was ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a horror movie and we thought it was stupid; as did my 13 year old! I expected to be at least scared. And yes, the gross factor for the vines that poured into the people was there; However, the management to get to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, stupid. I really mean who goes hiking ... in a jungle ... with a total stranger ... with a little water and a few snacks ... In FLIP FLOPS, no less ?! Puh-lease! Even better, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or is able to speak a little of the language? Are these people completing morons? The German brother is not heard and he does not call for help? Who doesn't? He just finds some Greeks and Americans going a bit and finding?
