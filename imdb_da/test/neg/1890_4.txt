I haven't figured out what the selected title has to do with the movie. This is another collection of monsters like HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Not exactly a masterful plot, but Universal needed to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department. He works on cure to keep Larry Talbot from becoming Wolf Man. Somehow, Count Dracula happens to get rid of getting a solution to his vampireism. And rounding off the good doctor's experiments is the restoration of the energy of the Frankenstein monster. Along the way is the kind hearted doctor blood devoid of Dracula. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. as usual, the soulful Wolf man. Glenn Strange is the Frankenstein monster who has very little to do this excursion. Also with the mentioned roles are Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
