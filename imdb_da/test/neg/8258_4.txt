In "Red Letters", Coyote is at the whirlpool as a college professor who writes to a female prison prisoner and gets more than he negotiates for. There are two reasons to see this flick ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, although it is difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete management disaster. Everything is wrong with "Red letters" ... coinciding, miserable manuscript, camera, editing and most of all that seems like Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously erroneous and amateurish flick not worth it the time.
