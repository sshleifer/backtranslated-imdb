I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could tell, along with his reductivist verbiage, he offered reductiveist stories. This movie transfiguration of the AF2A in a simplified, hopefully, interpreted narrative does not interfere with my suspicions: A guy who hardly sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) falls in with a nurse (Jones) and they conspire to spend time together. Hemingway's great contribution to the story was the romantic travel note? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so completely generic. The movie does not even lead the complete irresponsibility required to abandon the front in favor of a lover's adventure. The two have a season on the Alps, right out of a J. Crew catalog. A number of better scenes are undermined by corny, conventional melodrama elsewhere. The movie stops with small, unlikely, unspecific details that fight the epic treatment. The Hygiene Hospital, which Miss Barkley works in, is almost empty, so no secondary plot line may distract from the skinny history. Complicated, it's not. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is better than average, with some great location photography. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Do striking things in the first hour with an on-site, widescreen camera ... there are no other device copies. Vidor shows massive panorama tables, pans over a number of hundreds of soldiers penetrating the mountains; and then with a 90 degree turn of his camera catches up with the Hudson ambulance traps down on him. <br /> <br /> The Hudson looks great. He is a better actor than he gets the credit for, but with unformed material like this he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional shrew. Jennifer Jones is puffy and miscast in the salmon female lead. The movie is best when she is off. The love scenes are about that affect as a coffee commercial.
