"Many of the movies I've made might have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have many old-fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this movie is a loose remake of "A Guy Named Joe", it also borrows heavily from "A case of life and death "and" Wings of Desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg has often said he wants to make a "Frank Capra movie" in the way of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs Smith Goes To Washington". Judging from his recent attempt to get a "Harvey" remake from the ground, Spielberg seems to still hold that dream, the director rightly not satisfied with his last 3 ventures in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics at the time based "Always", saying that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but it's not at all the problem. The problem is that "Always" needs much more special effects to distract us from Spielberg not being able to film any dialogue line that doesn't end in an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is full of comedy that just doesn't work. Spielberg's comic taste is not very sophisticated, and seems to be torn straight out of the 1950's screw balls and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics can work in a cartoon universe, but in a movie it just seems like an odd marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie's main pairs come across as brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films have always been concerned about sex and intimacy, but this movie is in extreme lengths: she is a wisecracking tomboy and he is a wisecracking old man. They are more annoying than endearing. <br /> <br /> 7. The movie features a good scene where John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but mostly the movie's characters are too annoying. There is no subtlety, all feelings overplayed, every joke over the design, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to hear the audience. After their failure (and the double financial flaws in "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun"), Spielberg shattered the cold color scheme of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the more desatured "black and white" "worlds of" Schindler's List "," Munich "," Minority Report "and" Save Private Ryan ". From here, "less light" and "dark cinematography" were equated with "serious issues". <br /> <br /> 9. Following the financial success of each "dark movie", Spielberg returns to his color quaternary and falls flat again on his face. "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed "Ryan" and "Lincoln" follow "Munich". These "color" films are always bashed to be too sticky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you remove the desaturation, all those "serious" movies would feel the same. <br /> <br /> 10. Since the 70s, Spielberg has been trying to distinguish itself from the other brat-pack directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.) by pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist". He would repeat this himself repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s. The reality, however, is that he is probably the biggest sadist for all these directors, the film's form itself often undermines their content, their very box office performances are always related to their dazzling depictions. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg's inability to connect with any of the characters in "Always" and the joy he shows instead of recording forest fires, airplanes, etc., perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography . People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, stands, stones, etc. This is what Spielberg is looking forward to. The moment his character stops talking, all is self-destructive. A movie like "Amistad" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites spoke. <br /> <br /> 12. The movie's flying scenes are not up to standard set several years earlier in the mega-hit "Top Gun". Of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to do things cinematically. <br /> <br /> 13. Mistakes like "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. Are often brighter that Spielberg's more successful movie. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when it doesn't work, revealing the vacuum underneath the damaged machinery. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good order here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> Worth having a view.
