This movie worked with some of the most predictable story lines and superficial characters ever seen. The author of course bought the book "How to write a space disaster film" and followed it with games. Especially the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done over and over again. Max Q seems to have been written hoping that the producers would throw $ 50 million on the project. But judging by the last half of the film, which contained many lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $ 50 thousand. To hear that the movie was nominated for a "Special Visual Effects", Emmy has me completely gob-smacked. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school students with a media science pass could have created more credible effects! <br /> <br /> And the plot holes are too many to mention. But I want to choose one as an example. Now I am no NASA expert, but it is surely unbelievable that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator will suddenly hold power in the control room when things begin to go pear-shaped with the program. There is probably someone who is more experienced with Mission Control, whom the program director would call rather than a 29-year-old who has not previously been in the control room. The only saving grace for this movie is Bill Campbell's work. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from the train wreck that is this script. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10, with the overall work Bill Campbell starring it from a lower mark.
