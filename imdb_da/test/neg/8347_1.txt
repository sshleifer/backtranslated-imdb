The story of a volcano erupted downtown L.A. sounds like a good reason for a disaster film. However, this one is missing bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a story that is hard to follow or believe, and the play was very bad. I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is only good at settling people around as a boss in a particular area. In this he is on his way to the emergency office. Being the head of such an office is of course a good idea to bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches the walls and goes into tunnels that are believed to be 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes right. Apart from the bad actions, the actual flaws are making the movie look almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good point in this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make matters worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
