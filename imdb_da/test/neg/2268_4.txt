Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is totally devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When history encourages people to act confused, there are ten-minute scenes of people imitating the confusion. When history requires a small background story, there are ten minutes of scenes of Konkans green. When history requires a child who throws tantrums ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the extreme close-ups so you can count people's nose hair. There are movies to be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13 "TV. Also, Amruta Subhash, who plays Asavari, is the worst actress I've seen for quite some time. Practice overcomes for years to achieve what she does so easily. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 just because the subject is different and the story is not bad The fact that a movie like Shwaas comes to India's entry to Oscar doesn't tell volumes about the state of Indian movie, but the state of Indian judging committees.A movie is not good just because its subject is arty.
