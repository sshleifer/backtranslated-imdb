Okay, so one night and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately, we chose 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. I have never laughed so hard throughout my life. This movie is beyond bad. I literally pooped out better movies than 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' (I poop movies) The highlight of this movie, for me at least, was the opening sequence when Ernest makes stupid faces. When they showed him with a head on a peanut, I lost it. Maybe I found it so much fun because at that time I was the tallest. Maybe you are right. <br /> <br /> If I were to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I'd guess 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. Never before have I seen a movie rely more on 1950s stereotypes of people in color. There were times when words jumped me and I just stared in awe. <br /> <br /> If I saw this, I couldn't do without me, but is this movie for children? Are literate adults actually looking at this? How could there be a whole franchise of 'Ernest' movie? Is this really my life? Is this true? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
