Caddyshack II is nothing compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for that. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was to be the essence of this movie, but he did not like the script, would change what his request was denied, so he did not film. (2) It was low budget, Bill Murray had grown to superstar status. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase the so-called Ace of the first movie (although it was Rodney all the way) couldn't be in more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him. BUT you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all usable substitutions that no one had their best performances.
