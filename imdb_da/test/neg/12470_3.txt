The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of the movies I encountered in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team again since Bully. Unfortunately, "interesting" has never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does something she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from "in the crowd" and starts to hang out with them. And of course it is just like any other movie thing that is good (or so you assume, since the film never refers to things being good), and then it doesn't get so good about hanging with the rich children. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead lifeless movie that after you've seen it, you feel you could have done something better. Some scenes (those with Renfros parents) do not even have the opinion of being in the movie because the director and the author did not follow it at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that could have played out were just totally ignoring, and it's almost like watching one before they were stars episode (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from OC). <br /> <br /> The only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a ONE rating from me is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her in it. Renfro just looks like he brought a bit of his character from Bully. And for pete sake, the title is BS, change the name.
