What should have been a dramatic tale of life on the river Murray turns out to be a silly, sophisticated romance of an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with Aussie accent), which falls to the larva's first mate (John Waters) of a mushroom. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows some promise, but it soon falls flat as it becomes predictable and thin. Some real envoys and spark were needed in the plot to give the movie some life. Gus Mercurio's early departure didn't help as his character seemed to me to be the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer TV version is more profound because this video translation certainly lacked it. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
