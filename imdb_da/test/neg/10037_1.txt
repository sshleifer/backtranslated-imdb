In addition to the fact that this is only an abysmally made movie (imagine giving a video camera to the average high school drama club), the folks who think there is something "right" about this playful thing should grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: Ghosts don't exist. Most learn it from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You must seriously grow up. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was committed almost two centuries ago makes it no less fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't. Go to college. Or at least finished high school.
