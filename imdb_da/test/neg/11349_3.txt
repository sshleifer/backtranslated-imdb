Anyone of law and order is, CSI (take your choice of city) and homicide: Life on street weakest episodes is better than the strongest episode of Bones. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is stuck in crappy Angel fashion, and Emily Deschanel also portrays "Bones" ... unrealistic. The actors as a whole have horrible scenes together, whether with compulsive or just horrible lines. <br /> <br /> The murders are predictable after a while, as foreshadowing and tracing are just as obvious. <Br /> <br /> Music is okay, though it really is unnecessary at times. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bones is hardly the show I want to see on weekdays as it is a carbon copy of better shows with unreal characters and everlasting stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
