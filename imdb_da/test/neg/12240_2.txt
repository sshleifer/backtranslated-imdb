Comebacks is a spoof on inspiring sports movies, and just let me tell you it's not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it fun to refer to sports movies (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! To Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) And throwing in a few sex jokes would be the funniest thing since Fly! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job you'd think it was written in a week. I have found that if an instructor loves the genre, the movie will be good. Of course, Brady doesn't love the genre, he's spoofing. This movie is a rancid piece of waste that is not worth seeing, so don't see it!
