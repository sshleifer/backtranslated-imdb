I am used to being patient with movies because I have generally found it normally paid. But a few works take time to new levels and enter the provocation area .... "Last year at Marienbad" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "last year at Marienbad". On the one hand, I can count on the number of movies I have gone out over the years. "Pola X" achieved membership in the August group. In my defense, I think I have made a brave effort to stand on my ground - hoping things will turn around. But I finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "Pola X" will not live up to the promise of Carax's previous work anywhere. After a 10-year hiatus, it must have been bitter to him. Melville still jumps in her grave!
