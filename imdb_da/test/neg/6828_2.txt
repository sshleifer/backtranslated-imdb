"How many ppl know about this?" ... "Let's keep it that way!" I wonder at least that some new dialogues can be made or not? The movie is a really bad copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this movie while he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Geres's face with his cold-blooded stare as they meet near the harbor ... oh my god! scared hell out of me. Why he kills Major Koslova and her helpers are not quite clear to me. Another thing I could not understand was the poison solution he put on the car (what in the world was that?). The movie plot is haywire and the climax is boring. Another fun thing was how the Russian was killed in the club. I fell off my chair laughing when I saw that scene. Also what was the thing about the gay guy .. what was the purpose of serving. I think the movie is made too fast to be easy to understand. You really need to think about what the hell was on the director's mind. LAUGH OUT LOUD. <br /> <br /> And after all, Richard Gere was trying to hold onto the column between two fast moving trains. should have caused someone to lose their head if it is not in contact with the column.
