I signed in here just after watching this movie and felt it was so horrible that at least its reviews could be entertaining. But all your miscreants seem to be sweet like that. And since I want the job done right ... <br /> <br /> From the opening shot, the film establishes its contempt for the audience's excitement by displaying a completely unremarkable image of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little cool, but then it compensates the exciting excitement by overlaying the most repulsive soundtrack song I've ever heard. Some girl screams in whispering French over what sounds like plywood sheets slamming together. Anyone who decided to be there never ride a skateboard, I guarantee it. It seemed to be there to test the limits of the patience of the audience. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is about 50 percent slow motion. Do you know what's worse than a casual slow-motion shot? A gratuitous slow motion shot of * Nothing happens. * Here is a guy walking along a path. Here's a guy sitting. Here is a guy looking around. Here's a guy looking at another guy. After a while, I started watching the movie at double speed, which brings it back when people appeared on the screen that participated in the actual dialogue, which was rare. Once, I astonished the movie to find out what a girl was saying, only to find out that the camera showed her talking, but the sound was another horrible, horrible song, and her actual voice was not audible. <br /> This reminds me of some good advice I once heard about writing - if you have nothing to say, don't use fancy tricks to pretend to do it. Come back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, like slow motion and weird lighting and lenses and freaky music, are what the absence of content looks like and sounds like. Many people have apparently bought it and perceived emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting this on a movie that didn't do any of the work of creating it.
