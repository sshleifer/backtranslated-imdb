It's a really big bummer that people can also easily make movies because of cheap digital camcorders today. Normally, I would appreciate this opportunity, but if you see movies like this, it's just a big shame. And it's also great shame if people like hp. lovecraft gets abused by similar. I rented this "movie" cuz from the drop "hp lovecraft" on it. And I'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, especially those made by Brian Yuzna & Stuart Gordon. This movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap landscape on a beach and in an old wine cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" throughout the film. No actors, just some stupid low-model models that certainly have no idea what they are doing, stiff as wood. And it must also be the director. It is obvious that he was trying to create an atmosphere. But since the whole thing is so ridiculous it just doesn't work. and no gore effects, just some blood in a river (you drink = you become a demon) and drop here and there. Oh yes the story: thousands of years ago some "big old" world colonized and took people as slaves. then humanity became independent, so the "old" tried to destroy them. And now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. The only way to save humanity is to find NECRONOMICON, this is where LOVECRAFT comes. so these soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar. amazing - everything! But as it is called (German title: "Armee des Jenseits") and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it looks like you can make money on things like that. I find this fact impressive.
