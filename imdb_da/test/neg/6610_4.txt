Well, for a start, I must say that here in Russia is a story of Geralt of Rivia known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a gifted writer, or perhaps even genius of a kind - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical, and godly writer of fantasy worlds in a literary history. And when such great material comes in real hands, watch RPG games "Witcher" and you will understand what I'm talking about. "Vedmak Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite result. <br /> <br /> Missing budget. Lack of control. Missing good script. <br /> <br /> These three creepy whales make this son sink, eat it alive. It works well, sometimes even well, but for God's sake it cannot save this project. <br /> <br /> However, I still have some faith. I still hope that one day a new Vedmak movie will be created and the whole world will see the grandeur and breathtaking splendor of Sapkowski's books. P.S. But before that a Uwe Boll is eliminated. Only if you know it
