Of course, someone saw the "Blair Witch" wave. <br /> <br /> This movie was created as all the "reality" haunted shows that pop on TV lately (and I have to admit I get a kick out of these), but this movie is very cheesier! Probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the "participants" going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spend 10 minutes looking to go up to the ceiling is not my idea of ​​a good time. Any paranormal events are blatant setups. No strings, but too perfectly captured on the camera to be genuine. The participants were also not very sympathetic. Two stupid guys who do not take it seriously, a girl who scares a hat, and the quintessentially mapped "paranormal" person. Is this clichéd formula for a ghost movie? <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the last 15 minutes were pure excitement. They took every ounce of excitement in the film and fixed it for the 15 minutes. I admit I spent the time pacing in the kitchen. I really don't recommend this movie to younger viewers, even though it's PG13. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some entertainment, if you don't take it seriously, you'll get a kick off of this movie. There are plenty of situations to crack! If you are looking for a great story line .. look elsewhere;)
