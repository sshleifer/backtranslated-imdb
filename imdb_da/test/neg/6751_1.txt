It was pretty bad. pedestrian work or worse. I don't think it was homophobic, just really bad. If it was something, it was really amateurish as when you are 14 and first discover curse words and skinny. The main point of this film, the romance, really falls flat. I cannot fail to wonder if the authors have ever had serious relationships before this movie. <br /> <br /> Plotting and pacing are horrible, going anywhere. one minute we see these guys catching cheaters, then we are at a gay club, then we are on a date. Out of nowhere, the girl apparently looks at comics, and then they sleep together. none of this feels real, like a primary school production by Shakespeare, if Hamlet was written by a frat boy. <br /> <br /> The ending was kind of scary about the avenged fantasy of a loser who was dumped by a girl. Needless and actually disturbing. <br /> <br /> Still, you should see it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others noted, the director's comment is actually fun - what kind of professional is talking about "banging" or "hooking up" with the actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. You will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass.
