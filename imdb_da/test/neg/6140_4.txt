I had the privilege of seeing this powerful game on Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw another game in the 1970s, which had an emotional impact like this game. I was really looking forward to the game that was made for a movie, but was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates would not reproduce her role in the movie - she was not known from Broadway at the time and the producers would have wanted star power I takes and threw Sissy Spacek instead. Sissy did an appropriate job in the lead, but didn't meet Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for this role. The movie ticket was right for the game. Anyone who ever considers suicide should look at this movie to understand the destruction of those who are left behind.
