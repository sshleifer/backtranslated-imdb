I watched this movie on a show that showed bad B movies and tried to get you to buy them. It was basically just a long trailer, but gave you a really good idea of ​​what the movie was about. Having seen the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but it could still be entertaining in a perverse opinion. IT IS NOT ENTERTAINING in any sense of the word. The movie has two (or should I say four) things go for it, and it's not the number of deaths that are the women. They are hot and naked, and Mrs Lovell could be a legit actress, but not in a movie that emphasizes T&A and corny dialogues. This is not even a horror movie or scary unless you talk about watching the actors try to act. The production value is pathetic, the play is worse, and the writing is the worst. What was the purpose of making this movie? Scaring people? To rip off "Texas Chain Saw Massacre"? Trying to be fun? To show women's breasts? To put a guy's head into a retarded outfit with fake hands and legs? Having a sign just says the word "Snow" over and over again? In order not to have any real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover the fact, is there no real plot? In order to make a sequel to a movie no one has ever seen or will ever see? I made a mistake collecting this movie, not making this mistake too. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
