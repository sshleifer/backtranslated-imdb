Don't disagree with people who say this is a miserable horror movie with good acting and camera work - I'd say it's an okay horror flick RUINED of shocking abysmal action and bad camera work - see 'Ju- on: The Grudge instead of wasting your time with this waste. The main idea behind the movie is pretty much original, considering the abundance of killed-doll-based scary feast that has been foist over us over the years; Unfortunately, the story is handled with all the subtleties of the latest Michael Bay actor, with a cast of characters that are uniformly unlikely and played with precision-perfect cheek, because the actors presumably charged with Korean soap operas during the day. It's not scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations for the next Korean horror movie to come-a-call. Oh good.
