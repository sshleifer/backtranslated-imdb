The dominant conflict is between a couple of fine actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the horrible script. Apparently, the actors lost when the director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of ill imagination to the letter. Huppert and Dutronc's strong performance fortunately improves the overall quality of the film, which miraculously delivers depth and humor. Regarding Chabrul's persistence in keeping the film gentle and illogical, it reaches the climax of the final scene, which is so incredibly bad that you will wonder which pills he took himself while he instructed.
