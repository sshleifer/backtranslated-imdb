Doug McClure has played in some of these British produced genre adventures and this has to be the worst of the party. I know the COUNTRY that TIME FORWARD has its critics, but please remember film films and relatively good production values. That is the problem with this movie - The production values ​​go far beyond "so bad that they are good" devoted area and become "so bad, I think I want to go and see what's on the other channels" <br / > <br /> One case in point is the first scene with the pristine Cushing and McClure encountering a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster made to look over twenty feet high via overblown back projection. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by driving on the spot. Did I mention that this is one of the more compelling sets of pieces? No it really looks like it was filmed in one's living room with the extra change back from the Doctor of the Year's WHO budget. Even former doctor, who Peter Cushing is bland and what should have been an entertaining line "You can't fascinate me - I'm British" is delivered very flat (a very similar line spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) in a script without characterization , plotting and memorable dialogue. It is not only the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable, it is also rare and rare, since the monsters do not speak. It would not have been better to have the main bad guys humanoids like in the WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so they could explain the plot. Does anyone know what the plot actually is? <br /> <br /> A very boring British movie that even the two talents of Caroline Munro cannot save. The whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence of two keystone police
