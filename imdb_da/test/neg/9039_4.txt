You would think that a movie starring three of the greatest male movie stars in WWII World War II would have become a classic. These three there are also three favorites of me, going around in a drowsiness and looking like they'd rather be somewhere, but there. The sad thing is that the road west certainly had some potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, a film about American pioneers and travelers of their Western migration is something not being done now. It should have been better done again then. Kirk Douglas is a former US Senator who heads a wagon train west to build a settlement in Oregon's Willamette Valley. When he is an ex-politician, he ranks over the high he leads. The script requires that he not only has a covered wagon, but a wagon to carry the train. You think it's ridiculous you should see the whipping scene where Douglas orders his black waiter, played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I don't want to spoil it by saying what makes Douglas demand this from Glenn, but believe me, it's bad. Robert Mitchum is the trail guide and the three stars he looks most excellent. There should be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just scares through the film all over. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the friction has helped something because the film calls Douglas, a widow to look at Mrs Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she is the best look in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie billing says introducing Sally Field. This was made between her Gidget and her Flying Nun days. She plays a piece of white southern garbage with the musical comedy name Mercy McBee. We first see her in movies sitting on the back of her parents wagon, legs akimbo and welcoming. Of course, she gets busy with her invitation. <br /> <br /> Her character is something found in every trailer park in America, and then again what was a van but a large trailer park on the go. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field went on to a two Oscar career. What that woman had to overcome. Victor McLaglen's son Andrew instructed this subject and, along with a miserable script, made this a turbulent mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he has certainly done better in his career. <br /> <br /> And then, unless you are a stargazer.
