This seventh (yes you read right - the seventh) puppet movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be; by a French puppeteer who uses them to avenge himself on a group of old mummies who are after him as they learn to keep the secret to life. It was taught by him by a wizard, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to bring down normal dolls. This successor is basically nonsense, sprinkled with even more nonsense as most of the puppet master's successors. Due to PG13 rating, we do not even get entertaining puppet killings. Come to think of it, there is no cursed puppet killings. If there was a franchise to cut off, it would be this. No more .... God, please no more ...
