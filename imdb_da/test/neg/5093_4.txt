I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it didn't live up to expectation. A good movie has the audience identify / empathize / sympathize with the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. The story seemed very uneven and did not flow as it should / could have done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be a little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what seemed to be a bit part. Beautiful scenery and the play of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis were about the only plus. Perhaps by being a kiwi, I put the bar higher for locally made films. Perhaps the instructor / apparently difficult to work with the main actor biased my mind. Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses for a movie that could have been great. <br /> <br /> Many maybes that still don't explain why this movie was missing something special. <br /> <br /> It could have been good, it wasn't.
