I thought it would be fun. I did. I do not know what happened. But I think many of the problem are unfortunately with the casting. I don't know who this kid is, he could be a very nice person, but he wasn't entitled to this movie. And the support molding was great, which only makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest, and your mind just starting to wander, but Keith David starts talking, or Leslie Nielsen or Marion Ross, and it's as if someone was bright and suddenly you can pay attention. again, and you may not think so badly. But when they come back to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful, so the fact that most jokes were basically a bunch makes you doubt about who wrote this thing. I think it had a few funny pieces that I remember laughing a few times, but right now I don't remember why, and it was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Really I'm giving it a take it or leaving it rating, but I think most people should just leave it.
