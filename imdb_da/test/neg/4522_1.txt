Get Smart to get the title Get Stupid. There is not a fun line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad, it makes the Austin Powers movies watch Shakespeare. A few more movies like this and Steve Carell can kiss their career farewell. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this movie? She is a good actress but is just plain horrible. Scripture is pathetically low. There is no fun, smart or witty line. There is not a good vision. <br /> <br /> The management is horrible. Comedy is dependent on timing. Someone should tell the director. Every line that has to be fun (and not) comes with absolutely the worst sense of comics I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
