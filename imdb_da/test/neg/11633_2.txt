What a terrible successor. The reason why I give this movie two stars instead of zero because it is a movie that has violence and does and critters, but it is planned out badly. And this god-horrible sequel was made by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bone head that brought you remake of The Shining, which almost made Kubrick almost roll in his grave when he discovered it, was actually made. Garris is also the man who brought you the sad sequel to THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful movie, but Garri's movie almost destroyed John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order, don't. That's the mistake I made, rent the first or third or better yet, DO NOT GO TO THIS LEVEL! This movie sucked so badly that I can't believe it, please avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!
