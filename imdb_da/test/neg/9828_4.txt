The lavish production values ​​that you generally find in a Merchant / Ivory movie are all here, but it's a very boring challenge that could have been a very lively affair. I agree with a previous poster that it makes no sense that history should unfold through an African-American family, yet their own ancestor Sally Hemmings hardly has a role to play in the matter. There is not much clarity in helping the audience understand the motivation of any of these historical figures. And I was very bothered by accents of a number of characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for what you assume is a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to try different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly earned in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a way that we never get a grip on who she really is. For a moment she strikes a slave, and for another moment she deplores the whole slavery. Nick Nolte performs well enough, but never really cares for Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing overall.
