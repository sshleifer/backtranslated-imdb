I would never see Venom, but I caught it on cable. It has good elements. Louisiana swamp atmosphere to one, something we unfortunately will not see so much in movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, an ordinary man who is imbued with evil spirits. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting as it could much of the movie. But as a tendency to happen in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes down in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters save the good girl, starting with the black boys. I am a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the aforementioned son of the villain, CeCe, who is to become a voodoo priest, are more interesting. And for God's love, only once will I see the virgin killed. We all like the light girl, why can't she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips and we love her. <br /> <br /> The conclusion made no sense given what had been established about the invincibility of the villains. Everything carnage and atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
