Steve Martin has always had my respect for being a very fun comedian and a beautiful good actor, and I loved "Plans, trains and cars" and "Bowfinger" --- but "Bringing down the house" definitely is not one of Martin's funniest works, and it doesn't even seem to be trying, which is just sad ... <br /> <br /> I don't know; maybe I didn't like this movie because of the fact that I rented it with "Harry Potter and Secrets Chamber" and "Phone Booth", both are excellent movies, or maybe it's because I'm used to the much better from Martin or maybe it's just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Whether this movie just wasn't very fun or entertaining, and I never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle on the movie's gags, which really is a shame as the previews of this comedy were so promising! I expect to "bring down the house" to be an all-out comedy bash, and I certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter-racial laughter from Martin. Instead, we are 'treated' to see Queen Latifah jiggle all over the screen and try to make her best with her totally uninspired character. The funniest thing in this clunker is Eugene Levy, but even he doesn't get the screen time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to enjoy "Bringing down the House" but I didn't and I would find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most deadly Steve Martin fans. Jump over this and rent "planes, trains and cars" instead ... <br /> <br /> You get a much better time.
