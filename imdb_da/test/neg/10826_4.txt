I went to watch this movie to kill some time. I can remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his plays are wood, he shows a hard "leader" character. Same here. This film is about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a hole in Romania to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of prey. Look forward to 30 years and we have a team of divers called by some researchers and his crew to explore some caves for some unknown scientific purpose. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of clich√©, useless speech. The women are too hot for their jobs, let's see it. I hate to see the lips of these women talk about the boys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I think it was as if we were in a bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had ZERO personality, with perhaps exception from the researcher, who at least was not one of the young and beautiful people. Then the actor, though artistic, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty poor. At some point in the movie, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the leader heads - his irises morph into the Cingular wireless symbol, and stays that way. We are led to believe that when he was scratched by one of these monsters, he became one of them. Fair enough. But first of all, nobody says the obvious thing to him: "What's with your eyes, guy?" No. Everyone just talked about how he was "changed" and that he was no longer the leader of the group. And then this guy says, "You see how he's not human". Huh? If they really thought he was a friggin monster, why not act like that? Instead, the group split into two - those who go with Jack and those who separate, I think he's a monster. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie was this blonde dive woman creeping up a hollow wall and being attacked by this goblin. Her screams really sucked - but she fought like hell to send the goblin. <br /> <br /> The shooting was fine when the camera was still. But any action sequences, the director found it useful to confuse hell out of us by flashing bubbles, flashlights, dark spaces, god knows what. I wish they would just show us a scene just once for a while. Just because you move the camera anywhere, the movie doesn't make any SCARIES, guys. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if the following changes were made: <br /> <br /> 1. Each actor was replaced by a person who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the leader, it's OK to let him be the great one. I'm tired of seeing 20-something supermodel researchers. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed at the camera and sat still. This could be the director's fault, I don't know. Jumpy camera (as in Constant Gardener) gets old, people. <br /> <br /> 3. We saw that the goblins are actually turning off the people. How is something going on? There is not much else in this movie. We should hardly see the creatures - I felt a little torn about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was rather lame. During the denouement, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what it is? It's a little canned. The ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy (Morris Chestnut) who seemed to breathe a little sympathy with his character just by his worried expression. All the other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4 out of 10 because after all, the play was without noticeable errors and the concept was pretty original. I'd like to see Cole do more military roles - he's good at it.
