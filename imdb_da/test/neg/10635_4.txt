How could a movie dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants be robbed and beaten across the border, be boring? Well, "Border Incident" is. No wonder the song and dance man George Murphy's career did not end long after this horrible movie came out. Politics was definitely a way out for this future senator, who dies a horrible death in this slow-paced movie. The movie stereotypes the typical Mexican migrant workers who are dimwitted and very stupid. <br /> <br /> The film only appears in intensity when the identities Murphy and Ricardo Montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the US and Mexico, respectively. <br /> <br /> Disappointing at best, we see similar problems in our very own community today.
