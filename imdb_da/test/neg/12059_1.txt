Camp Blood is a horrible slasher movie. We mix Friday the 13th with the Blair Witch Project and add .... a killer in a clown mask. The budget for this movie must have been very low, some of the actors played several parts and the camera produced a picture similar to the colored version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anyone has seen the version will help me to be bad . <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There is nothing in the movie, even worth seeing. The fact I saw this all the way stunned me. Just take my advice and buy or rent this movie. It's terrible.
