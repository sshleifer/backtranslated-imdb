This was made in 2004 for God's sake, what happened to our state-of-the-art special effects? What happened to our hard around the edges, but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly horrible, there was one or two that wasn't bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. Couldn't stand listening to the poorly written dialogue, I mean who the hell wrote that script? Please never write again! Special effects? Don't even get me started on the special effects. SORELT, they could have gotten better than completely fake looking green balls of light in the eye's plug. It looks so old and ... honestly. Even the easiest thing to do is look real .. the teeth, they looked so fake and stupid that I would almost dry a tear from the eye in irritation. Come on, I can't believe it was even shown to the public.
