An Sci-Fi network original. Not the best. Not far from being the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbled on a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel land that has been taken over by mutant spiders. The mutations have been controlled by a super-big alien Queen for the last thirty years. She has already eaten up in the population of this parallel world, resembling Chicago minus residents. Guess what? Now she has to find another world to feed on. The electrician leads a four-person team who reluctantly finds himself with the task of saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also includes: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would have thought that the Sci-Fi network could have spent more money on special effects.
