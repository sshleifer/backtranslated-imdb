While the film was beautifully shot and reasonably worked well, the script was boring. plodding and nothing we haven't seen before. Not once in this movie did I ever feel that these people were really in danger. No noticeable climax and a very standard resolution. I think this type of movie has been exaggerated and should be given a rest. After all, didn't everyone on the planet "Schindler's List"?
