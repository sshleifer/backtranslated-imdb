Looking at "Baghban" is the movie that is similar to trying to eat a way out of a salt water loss vessel for nearly three hours. This Indian movie is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts as "King Lear", proceeds to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle section and then returns to "King Lear" for its tear-like finale. <Raj Malhotra is a bank consultant who seems to have everything a man might want out of life: A wife who loves him, a family who loves him, and a job that he is retiring after a lifetime of faithful service. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four adult sons, they still seem like a couple of love hit newlyweds, cooing and sighing, banging their eyes and whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears almost to the point of nausea. In fact, whole bloody breads are so happy, loving and harmonious that they make Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. The parents and kids laugh together, laugh together and perform elaborate choreographed "spontaneous" song and dance songs together (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama with a large number - in this case too large a range of musical sequences). Anyone who knows anything about the story is aware that such untouched happiness cannot be allowed to go unpunished for a long time, and that all the joy is merely the preaching of some terrible disasters destined for the head of our unsuspecting breeders. When we know this, we are using the film's first hour of terrible anticipation and wondering exactly what form that catastrophe will take when it finally arrives. The thunder clump arises about an hour into the movie when Raj announces his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families and leave the choice of which it will be up to the children and their respective spouses. Suddenly, as King Lear discovers the taps hidden in the family's bosom, Raj finds out that his children are not as loving, selfless, and eager to share their homes and live with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably appalled at the prospect of obeying their parents' plan, the children must come up with an arrangement where Raj will stay with one of their children while Pooja will live with another; then they will turn off until each of the children has finally had a chance to host both parents, and then the bike will repeat itself on infinitum. Much to the children's fate joins the parents plan, although the two are deeply in love with each other and have never spent any time apart. Thus, the second and most of the third hour are offered to the two aging (albeit married) lovers who pity each other, while their tireless, insensitive little brats do everything to get their parents to understand how unwelcome they are in Their home. <br /> <br /> One of the big issues with "Baghban" is that it lacks ease in both its storytelling and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the close proximity of the family unit, is so thick in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of sentimentality. Then, almost without any warning, the manuscript changes a crown and converts the children to restless, self-centered monsters and the parents of passive, whiny victims of this turmoil. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-sufficient to make the dreamy eyes, pouting, untouched love bit, more appropriate to love school children than the parents of four adult children. The little prose style, where all emotions are emphasized and highlighted, leads to intense exaggeration and a great dependence on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical figures give some liberating joy in the beginning, but they go on for so long and so often turn away that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve to exhibit the material only for indelible proportions. At least an entire hour could be carved from this inflated production without any distinction being made - and a lot of good. There really is no reason why this movie should be drawn on to punish three hours. Most infamous of all is the seemingly endless harangue we end up with, a speech in which Raj (who somehow managed to turn his experience into an award-winning bestseller) refines us all about the verities of parenting / child relationships at least ten minutes at least. "Baghban" is a juicy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-size box of See's chocolate. Try at your own risk.
