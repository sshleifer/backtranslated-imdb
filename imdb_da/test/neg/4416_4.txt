After looking for this Bruceploitation for several months, and then accidentally bought it cheaply, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R site and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a pretty bad martial arts movie. King fu was not that bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful, and the movie really works, really long, much longer, so it's 85 minutes driving time. On a positive note, the monkey was fun for a few seconds (especially when I think they took the only dense of that face from another movie), and the black guy who pops up halfway was fun because of the one line he said as singlehanded made all black people resemble complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
