Sometimes, when I hear an A list, the movie is cast together for 2 hours in a movie. I hope and pray that it is good, not for my 10 bucks or 2 hours of guilt, but for those actors' sake career. In the case of "being cool" everything went to waste. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a music director played by James Woods are running in a car talking about movie sequels and how most are not good. If you see, the fact that this scene was shot in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in "Pulp Fiction" and listened to the dialogue you cannot fail to consider, was the one) a disclaimer to the audience that this movie will suck, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about successors in a sequel. Oh irony! (In case you wonder, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and sleek Chili Palmer from the first and best movie "Get Shorty" is revived to play a mobster-gone music business pro. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from his ghetto pimped out the Jewish leader (Vince Vaughn) and transforms her into a singing experience. Of course, a movie about an ex-mobster can never be complete without new mobsters causing destruction. This time, the elected electorate is Russian, played by American actors who cannot trade Russian if my whole family turns them upside down with their Russian bare hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian, I was not so much offended by the way this movie portrayed Russians, but instead as an author, I was more offended by the terrible dialogue. This movie was trying too hard to make the audience laugh. It became potentially good lines for a redundancy. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same ones that were only reformulated a few hundred times. After calling Rock's character of ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard for Vince Vaughn) and Cedric Entertainer's character a ***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage threatening those who don't play his tracks with guns) I wanted to leave the cinema because it was painful to sit through. If this was "Get Shorty", it would not be necessary to be in the movie to build drama or a really bad laugh. What was lacking in this movie that was not in "Get Shorty" was Chili's hot spicey attitude. He is a completely different person in this successor. First, the old Chile would have had more dialogue. John Travolta has no more than 20 speaking lines in "Be Cool" because he's out on the scene of the repeating lines, and the hundred and two cameo appearances of the most random celebrities. I will not ruin the shock by revealing all cameos to those who actually plan to watch this movie (PLEASE DO NOT !!!), but I will say that it will forever amaze me that these people agreed to be in a movie of such inanity. What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays widow of James Woods, which LUCKILY is killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie). Tarrantino has never made Pulp Fiction an idiot as director of "Be Cool" to row around with. This dance number was boring, long and simply throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people did not make the scene something memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many plot holes that I left the theater asking myself why? Everything about this movie was a big question mark. I just didn't understand the meaning of anything. I couldn't even explain why the Russians were after all or why this movie was ever made because I'm confused. All I took out of this movie was that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all the ads that Diet Coke, Yahoo !, the Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa (even spokeswoman himself is in the movie) and Bad Screenwriters Guild. Plot holes, stupid dialogues, too many random cameos, terrible appearances (even by the pros), and a not so entertaining attempt to imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this movie the worst movie in 2005, and it's only the third month of the year.
