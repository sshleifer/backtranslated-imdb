This movie is a disaster from the beginning to the end. 75 percent of the film is made from scenes taken from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN low edited with original scenes that are nothing more than a complete rip-off. I am a big fan of the two movies and watching scenes taken from them, edited and re-encoded with an inconsistent dialogue that makes my head spin. These kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by stupid unsuspecting audiences killed basically killing the Sword & Sandal genre back in the 1960s. There is a memorable scene in the new recording, and this is where Hercules struggles with the bad Hercules. The fight is cool anyway, and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, is clearly out. He makes a memorable nemesis to Herc. But the rest is cross-border embarrassing, which was probably shot in one day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
