The idea for the movie was not that bad: a horror movie shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was the foamy camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the one and a half long walk this guy went into the maze. Oh, I'm sorry, "the corn". I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much longer with it. Bill Cowell's play was not so bad, I would actually say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his fellow stars did not help his efforts. Here's hoping that his next movie will be easier to swallow.
