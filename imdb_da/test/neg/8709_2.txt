I had great hopes for this movie, I even gave a night to watch the Stargate for this movie. I found it had a hasty feel about it, and many of the most important biblical moments and facts were lacking. I might be a little abandoned and spoiled for the 1956 version, since I've seen one every year for the last 20 years. I doubt that this will make it the annual classic of the classic as the other has. If you haven't seen the 19546 version, you may like this, but I seriously doubt it and encourage you to skip this and go or rent or buy the classic. This has some nifty special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I tell a movie like the Ten Commandments. I was kind to see how they told the story, and the authors didn't do a good job with this.
