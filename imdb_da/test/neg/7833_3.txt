A quick resume: Almost non-existent, poorly selected musical soundtrack, constant camera film made without the stable but with plenty of coffee and a hyperactive camera man, no plot and nothing ever really happens. The movie goes from one dialogue to another, leaning in the hole, never achieving depth and never creating the illusion that you are really into a spider's web of conspiracy, and everyone-having-a-affair-with-everyone is just a boring excuse to show The most important actress in lovely underwear. (which, in combination with its rusty voice is certainly nice, but nothing to base a movie on) The highlight for me is the opening scene, and the film deteriorates right from there to a point where I would just stop the movie about 45 minutes into history. I'm sorry to put it out.
