This step is bad on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. OK - The Good Points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty ban in black leather. Some of the landscapes were amazing. It's about it. Oh, and it was a good touch to have the buffalo head over the bar in Freemanville, I expect it was a nod to the buffalo soldiers. The movie starts out as OK, but the characters are so flat, so cartoon, so "very", the evil ones are just over the top bad, I choke trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American War was 1895-1898, as America was only involved in April to August of '98. I think the movie said it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I won't look at it again to check). A large part of this film hinged on KKK, who killed Jessy's father. Good boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The clan was not even during this movie's time. Of course, the unpleasant bass ** rds was recorded again in 1915, and we know the rest of it. BUT, for the purpose of the movie, it is historically wrong and that was a big part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy about going into that much more so here a few jabs and I'm done. I didn't know Boyz2Men and other bands were inspired by New Orleans street singers from the 1890s. I didn't even know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while having acrylic 1 "nails ... We're just about to die laughs and I like a cheesy western more than most people do, such a waste of talent and money - this really had the opportunity to show a part of American history that is not known. people / lwf /bkcwboy2.htm for some more information.This could have been so good but it was just .... bad from 1-10 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because Mario looks good in his hat, and there was an Appaloosa horse in the movie.
