Because they all just look at the MST3K with their artificial friends who do (mostly) not so funny and obvious comments about movies. And that's the only way these people look at them, and then commenting and downsizing them on IMDb based on it, they don't even try to watch the movie on their own. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on my own, I didn't read reviews first, I didn't have some people telling me what to laugh about, I just got the DVD (bought for the Morons From Outer Space front page , an old fave) and looked at it. For the reason, I knew what I was up to as it is a Golan Globus, Albert Pyun movie, but they can usually be entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is a not too stressful brain Alice down in the rabbit hole story, done so many times and the like in the basic structure (but totally different in content) to the Warlords of Atlantis, another entertaining B movie . <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then it is the idea that they even throw with a few lines in the movie. The characters had one of the worst over-the-top voices / accents in English language fi It's not a good movie, but it's not a really bad movie, it's just a bit of an average B-Movie DTV kind of movie, nothing for enjoy nothing for outstanding, and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age group (say 7-14 year olds) than me. It's a bit of a bright fantasy. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago, I'd have. <br /> <br /> Don't be too hard on a movie because a couple of dolls also told you that this movie doesn't take seriously, and there's certainly no Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
