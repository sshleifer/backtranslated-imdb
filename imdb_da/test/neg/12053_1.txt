Yes, I bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap, I think I hadn't expected a great movie judging at the front, I didn't really expect anything good but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds (I don't complain about the boobies ..) I complain about what the hell is having to do with something? this movie should have been kept in there hand camera at home as a joke .... they suck .. why was the blood more brown and turd like the real blood? ... cheaply I tell you I think everyone was not in color, they were just colored yellow. And another thing that made me die, laughing at this sad excuse for a movie was that they were trying to pretend to be a clown, was a woman all the time, although it was clearly a flattened black short haired man. .. someone else notice that the only special effect in this movie was a lowered jump. it was also bad oh and the resolution effect you can find on many basic pc programs like ... powerpoint .... this movie blower
