I can't believe I even tried to see this filth. As an avid B-Horror movie fan, I was more than ridden on the prospect of this movie by the popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, I couldn't think of a worse movie than this for my life. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slowly, the film pulls on without any real horror to talk about. However, I will admit the sheer hilarity of a few scenes when Dr. Gore soon mesmerizes his victims. The camera zooms in on his excessively large, bulky eyes, while constantly there is this purely enchanted soundtrack to add to the entertainment. I laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. After he has built up his "miracle woman", the film turns off almost 20 minutes and just shows him and his "boyfriend" as he teaches her to talk, then they speak, bloom among morning balls, have picnics etc. Unfortunately, there is only music plays throughout this fandango without any speech. This part of the movie will leave you if you had beaten your wrists with a boring knife edge. I almost want to awaken at the very thought of this movie. If you like movies that are bad, see this one.
