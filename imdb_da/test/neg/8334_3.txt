When the movie started, I got the feeling that it was something special. The action and the camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathize with them. The movie had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of imagination. <br /> <br /> But as the movie continued, the plot never seemed to start and just rolled on stage after stage. I couldn't understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the signs occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. Without this connection I was right back with a couple of creepy short stories. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it did so well in Cannes
