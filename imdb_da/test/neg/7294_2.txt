I don't want to say much about this movie because there is not much to say because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite people from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor is trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all the characters are changed to something they never were, and should never be, animation that is downgraded to the lowest degree possible, and finally, why would anyone doing wonderful voice-over work for Obi - Who Kenobi in "Clone Wars" will copy Michael J. Fox? I have the answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately it is true. <br /> <br />.
