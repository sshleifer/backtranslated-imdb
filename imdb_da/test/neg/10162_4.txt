There were many "spooky" westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it's not one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stops at a 'Halfway House' salon, finds it full of dead bodies, the barman's corpse draped over the bar with a gun, his eyes see Randy from behind, holes cut through the eyes of a picture and a player's piano plays. most beautiful night. " <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery of the Marvin Black gang to get Ed Rogers' $ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who "works alone" wasting some time being arrested, escaped (with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landed in the middle of the black gang yellow behind a waterfall. It all moves very quickly. Only one too many hunt for Randy lowers it. <br /> <br /> We even get George Hayes, shaved and playing two parts - Marvin Black, the villainous villain, as well as the good citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but writing down messages gets it really fast, even for him when he finally gives up, he says to the end of Sally: "Oh, I'm tired of this! " You can find George playing a boring, spooky, double-cross villain in the "The Lost City" series (1934). I think this is the only 'Lone Star' movie in which the title relates or is mentioned in the movie! Sally offers his hand to Randy and says, "He's not alone!" Then cut their arms around each other as they look toward a lake. Sally runs off with Randy seems to be suddenly and not adequately prepared. Too much time for riding escape the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not so bad considering everything, but not so big. I really wanted to give it 4 and a half.
