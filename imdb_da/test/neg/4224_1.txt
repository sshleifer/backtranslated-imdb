A desperate attempt to make a "movie-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the movie becomes short. It has no credible plot, some of the most important players were a joke (NOT Lars Bom, he is cool!). I liked the "access limit by maximizing bandwidth" though. I finished it in principle, but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours in my life ...
