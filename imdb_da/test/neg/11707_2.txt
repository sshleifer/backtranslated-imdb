The second Boleyn Girl - not confused with the book on which it claims to be based. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand that they are changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened to Anne Boleyn - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, make-up fluff. A shame. <br /> <br /> First, the author and director seemed to think it was a good idea to set up the story as if it were a reality TV show. Seriously. They have Boleyns sitting in front of the camera and confess how they really feel about what is happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confession (not church kind, real world art) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she just wants to sit and smile about. She looks stupid to use such a modern film arrangement in a movie set of the 1500s. It's "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after 'The Aristocrats' and 'A Turn of the Screw' I became a true fan of her. But she should never have been thrown like Anne. In fact, I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a bad choice. She is a good actress, of course, but she has very modern features and does not seem convincing in the period costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie and tried to find out if she was "the girl" from "The Truman Show." She was.) She's too old to play the teenage Mary, so of a or some other unknown reason they made Mary the oldest of the sisters. It makes no sense, I know. It's like the BBC seemed to forget that these people actually lived. They twist the story around and make things left and right. I feel ridiculous about having to correct the BBC for historical inaccuracies, but really! <br /> <br /> Apart from the two sisters, the rest of the cast was actually selected. Steven Mackintosh struck me as an excellent choice for George, and his casting was the right reason why I decided to find this movie. Big mistake. He does a good job, but he hardly has this. How can anyone pretend to customize The Other Boleyn Girl and hardly mention George Boleyn? It's just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but once again, was hardly in the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There is just no one to get around it. It's bad. It's really, really bad. It is too melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is portrayed as an air-head, mary as ringleader and George as a follower. Mary's first husband is hardly mentioned, her relationship with the king has never been explained - they simply don't tell the story that Phillippa Gregory wrote. It all comes across as a big big waste. I have no desire to see this thing again. I think I'll just read the book again and hope the Natalie Portman version will be much better next year. Note: With this writing, the only way to achieve this on the mini series in the United States is on the final disk of the minisaries "The Six Wives of Henry VIII." It's a big miniseries, but can cost $ 50 to $ 60, and it's a lot to use if you're just looking for this piece of waste.
