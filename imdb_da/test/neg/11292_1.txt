The only reason I didn't sleep in this movie is because the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal lives> Live> Live and live !!! This movie is just horrible, not because of violence or graphic mutilation. It is actually pretty pretty in that respect. The story moves in the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that Director Ridley Scott just called this one. The actors are all fine, they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It is especially noticeable as there is not much in the film. It looks good, but it's not enough reason to see it. By the way, did I mention that it lives? <br /> <br />
