I watched this movie for the hot guy - and he even sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I have to give props to the freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. The guy wasn't so sweet in the end, he had the most horrible accent, and he was the most definitive definition of hicksville idiot who can't stand up to his mother for the one he "loves" who has ever been. All in all, and if it makes sense to you when I go to the movies in the video store, I think of myself as I read the back of a movie that looks like this: "Well, in every fall not worse than Carolina Moon. "The most horrible movie and the most horrible writing, acting, plot - all in it made my gag reflexes back to flips. It was the most horrible movie I will ever see, with Gabriela also up there. I hated it and trusted me if there was anything under 1 IMDb had for rating, I would choose it in a heartbeat.
