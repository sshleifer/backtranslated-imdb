Too much stock footage (almost a third of this 53 minute movie) really slows this down. Went to the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say "Ro-DAY-oh"), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the bad girl (usually a latina - even in the big "duck soup" [1933]) and "heroine" Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hi! It's her sister!) Could have benefited from more screen time. The happy end is too sudden - though this time John Wayne actually kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting stock footage was the long rodeo parade of true Indians, squaws and papooses. But when the best part of the movie is Stunt work from Mighty Yak, Yakima Canutt, who gives us jumps from one horse to another and several races run on a horse, you know we're in trouble. As noted by others, the final battle with the villain is very poorly executed. My copy from the Platinum Disc Corporation constituted an added sparingly, scary (pseudo-classical) stereo music track that destroys the authenticity of the original movie. (The DVD box had 'improved sound 5.1' on it.) To modernize and color it, add a "western" sounding score with acoustic guitars, clip-knocking heads, accordions, and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we must say that this is one of the weakest Lone Star bets.
