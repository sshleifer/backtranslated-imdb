This movie is bundled with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films provide a lot of demand in their DVD prints. Firstly, both films are very dark - it often makes it difficult to see exactly what happens. Second, no movie subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dub. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for the non-purists out there it is no problem. However, these DVD issues are not the fault of the original filmmakers - just the indifferent package is being marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it's about the murder of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem as Van Johnson looks as much as Garfield as Judy Garland. In no way does he look like Garfield. He lacks the crown, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (believe me this, I am an American history teacher and we are paid to know these kinds of things!). Real Life Garfield was a civil war general and looked like the boys at Smith Brothers hosted drop boxes. In addition, it is just surreal to use another actor to give Johnson the voice of copying. Never before or since has Van Johnson sounded so macho !! He was a fine actor ... but certainly not a convincing secretary-general or macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid casting, President Garfield's death was by no means like this movie. It is obvious that the filmmakers actually put on the crazy speculation about conspiracies on JFK's, not Garfield's death. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a lonely gun with serious mental problems - not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (over two months later) was incompetent doctors - who probed and probed and tried to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or tools in the process. In other words, as George Washington (who was basically killed by repetitive blood loss during pneumonia), he died due to malpractice. In the movie they got nothing right at all ... other than actually President Garfield was shot. Because the film carries almost no resemblance to true story, it is like a story lesson taught from someone from another planet or a person with a serious brain injury. Why not also include ninjas, combat robots, and the Greek gods while you're at it?!?! Apart from some decent action and production values, because the script is completely cow crap, I do not recommend anyone to see it. It's just a complete and complete mess.
