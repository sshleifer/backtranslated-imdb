Nothing about this movie stands out as if it is fantastic or terrible. <br /> <br /> Finally, it kills it. Blandness is just not good. I can't say I was expecting better from Will Smith, but I certainly did from Kevin James of "The King of Queens" - but hi, I'm used to saying it a lot lately. This movie tries to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the bull's eye. In fact, it never hits * anywhere * within the goal. Allergy scene is disturbing; The fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch any guard and is therefore (in a movie like this) not fun. This movie is constantly trying to win your heart, but always with the wrong trick at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm looking for examples for my brain), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
