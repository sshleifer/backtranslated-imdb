SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will pamper your afternoon or "little hours in the morning" see slot. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He has portrayed good characters in the roles I have seen. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What starts out as a promising movie soon disappears with the catastrophic cgi'd background and the extreme close-up of the person dying ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> To describe it as hammy acting would offend pigs. This movie goes to the bottom of ham barrel and scraps the play out there. <br /> <br /> Aside from Marc Singer's overcooked hamming it up, Mike Dopud and plods around the landscape and looks like he's afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide eyes 'manic' bad guy makes him just for a fun. He is not threatening at all. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two, but his character would have been threatened by a cashier who offered him "paper or plastic". <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman to get her life back despite attracting the wrong kind of man ... She was unremarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is remarkably similar to "Cliffhanger" - experienced guide, loses someone in a fall, conscience sticks to help someone else, a missing treasure worth money money and a gang of n-do wells that utilize the guide. Apart from Cliffhanger, a great vehicle was to Stallone and Lithgow. I have to admit that Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the accidental comedy was poor. There were times when I wasn't sure if they were using a rubber-face model as a stand-in for Singer when he tried to storm the weather station in vain (no pun intended). Pushing his face to the door post and his clumsy way generally did nothing to help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like seeing paint dry or grass growing. Or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
