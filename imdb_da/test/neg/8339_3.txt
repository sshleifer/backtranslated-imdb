When I watched this movie, all I could think of was what a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the film itself. I've seen many movies, but it's definitely one of the worst ever. I don't care about a volcano eruption under the center of L.A. is possible or not. Maybe it's not, but even though it might have been a good movie ... but it's probably not, and I'll explain to you why. <br /> <br /> I don't know how much lava flows out of an average volcano, but what I know is that the volcano in this movie makes Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo together like a small grill. I don't think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie, but I really wonder why he all used it on the special effects and not the script and the actors. I'm not saying he should have hired a top cast, but it's really the opposite of what I would call good acting. Their performances are so incredibly poor that it makes the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script, you're probably asking yourself. Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea that people stand a few feet or even few meters from the shelf without being burned or hiding from the heath? Or do people sink into the ground when the lava flow is not even two meters high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I wouldn't be proud if I wrote such a script, but there are apparently scriptwriters in Hollywood who don't mind credibility as long as it pays good money! VERY GOOD MONEY !!! <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you'll agree with me that this is one of Hollywood's worst disaster movies, no more than 3/10.
