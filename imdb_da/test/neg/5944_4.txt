Recap: A band of five young American men, all that remains of a platon that was severely hit by the Ardenne offensive during World War II, gets the job as an alien and searches for enemy activity. They are in a really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have hit gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once nice mansion full of food. But after a while there is some enemy activity, and that is very strange. Not hostile, but odd. It seems that there is a German squad out there, in just as bad condition, who won't have more than surrender. <br /> <br /> Comments: Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better, but the story doesn't seem to translate very well into the big screen. In fact, it is another war movie, much more about mental pressure in wartime than fighting and fighting. But I can almost feel the scenes that must have been full of excitement, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just falling flat in the movie. It is not exciting, just different and in many ways absurd. Many times people just seem insane, and the causes are unclear or at best suggested. <br /> <br /> So when this mental pressure fails to get through, the main building part of the whole story thought the story had gone through. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge, and it didn't really send a message. In fact, it did nothing. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors who then became stars at the beginning of their career. The play is good, but not star, and a few characters also fell into the absurd zone. Much of that too I feel is due to this story, these characters need time, space and pace given in a novel that they cannot be given here. And halfway it's definitely not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
