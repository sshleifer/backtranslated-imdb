I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and the Mythos background created some pretty good other stories and things like that. And in the last few years, some boys made movies about H. P.'s work, ?? mostly low budget flicks ?? and showed them to the public in places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them don't have a big budget, but they know at least the heart and "soul" of Lovecraft's work and movies like "Cool Air" or "Call of Cthulhu" - is what I would think - gifts for fan base and other loonies that like HP's creation. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon who just rip the name and create a movie that would have been fun to see if I had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down the beach. That was it, Mr. Zuccon did what it looks like, but while blocks like Aaron Vanek's or Bryan Moore's earlier films might not have had more budget, somehow they had more and more to offer, like a story, real characters, and a connection to Lovecraft! Just blabbering names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" make a movie not a Lovecraft customization. <br /> <br /> Yet, this flick will not only make Mythos fans shake and hide, nor will it appeal to people who 1. as good movies, 2. laugh about bad movies, 3. as good C - grade splatter movie or 4. watch everything that has Horror written on DVD cover. I will not go into the "plot" of this waste of time as it has already been discussed by others here on this site, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is a movie I would have made with some geeky friends. Apart from that, there are ideas for any narrative and goes into ridiculous "moronic-nonsense-but-it-it-art-stuff". Made flicks of this "quality" are fun to see if you know all the blocks in it and haha, see how XY coughs the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff ?? but hi, you don't put this in a dvd box, declare it a real movie and want money for it ?? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 because of what I dunno ?? effort or something
