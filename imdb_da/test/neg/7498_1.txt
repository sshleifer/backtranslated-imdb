Hello everyone - for what it's worth, I'm in a doctoral program in Indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year of fieldwork, mostly in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I'm a big movie fan in general, so I went out as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This I saw in the theater when it was opened while I was there, and fortunately closed shortly after. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this movie? The ruined wives and daughters of the Indonesian superelite whose antics are weak and inefficiently parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who can never afford even a single dish, let alone an entire meal in the movie's central restaurant location? Or gay Indonesian men whose dilemma in the country's Muslim-dominated society is reduced to absurdly simplistic, how-to-respect-self preaches. <br /> <br /> If all this wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack was either busy or mixed so incompletely that even native Indonesians couldn't hear many of the lines. <br /> <br /> In Map, if you're looking for a groundbreaking gay movie from a region of the world that seems to be the least likely to produce such an animal, forget about it. "Westler" from the early 80s or "My beautiful laundry" from the same era fared better in putting a happier face on dealing with homophobia and doing so by not showing through incessant, wordy scenes. <br /> <br /> Overall, an unfortunate waste of money is in a country that still cannot educate or keep healthy children.
