The plot involves a new hairdressing salon that moves across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So he feels that he has to change and improve his store by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds really exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, much of the same material from the first film involves. The people who work at Calvin's stand speak loudly and mouth to each other and the customers. Once again, Cedric the Entertainer was mildly fun, but it's more like making a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. And Calvin faces another moral problem of taking a large sum of money. He has already shown that he will do the right thing in the end. <br /> <br /> FINALLY VALUE: Nothing new. I do not recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced ​​bread.
