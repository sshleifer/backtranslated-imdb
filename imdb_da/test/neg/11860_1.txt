There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie". A movie, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends come together to make during a weekend with a video camera. In my time as a seer I have seen May examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I attended a screening by author / director Jon Satejowski's "Donnybrook." Now I've read the script and seen two different cuts (a rough piece and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say it's a movie. And a student movie with it. It's because a better word is lacking, competent, that is, the director knew how to push a record on a camera and capture moving images. The visions are mostly static and unimpressive, and dialogue scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with small to no close-ups, allowing the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modest budget, but any visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have been a long way to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> Granted, there have been independent images that have shown that limited camera work can come across well-written, exciting storyline and a sharp dialogue. Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies and video tapes" come to mind immediately. However, this film has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to repair his relationship with his father, then I feel this movie misses the point. What I have learned is that Davie's greatest aspiration is to "change the role of rock". However, we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is a dream sequence in the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, we all seem to get scenes of Davie listening to music or randomly strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played many concerts, but we never see him in full rock mode. Next time, SHOW does not speak to the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, Davie does not resemble anyone who would have been great in the 1970s glamrock era; He looks as though he would be more comfortable in the early days of rock'n'roll, which constitutes James Dean's less talented brother. Meanwhile, the rest of the movie events seem to occur randomly rather than rather clich√© characters, and stories that have little or nothing to do with the slender main story are raised and abandoned with alarming frequency (ie, the subplot involving Terry's father). If I want to see a movie of this kind of random construction, I will consider seeing "Napoleon Dynamite" again, a movie I could hardly do it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the above mentioned dialogue scenes, I have to mention that they are few and extremely far apart. Is it too much to ask for signs that speak? I don't think it is. When the characters speak, it is concise, chopped sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angry grunts or game over-the-top outbreaks. These signs simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it's easy to understand why there's only a good performance in the movie, Al Hudson, and that's just because he's making a bad imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on the screen. A good instructor or at least one ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these issues and get the author and the camera to correct them. But when Satejowski is so close to the material, he simply does not see them, or if he does, he is not willing to take the necessary steps to correct them because it will harm his creative vision. Being incapable or unwilling to handle criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a self-abusive, misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we are back with a bad, high school set, knock-off of Zach Braff's amazing "Garden State" combined with the equally amazing "Velvet Goldmine", two more movies Now is the value of your time. <br /> <br /> Now before any of the casting or crew get out of the word work to take me for this review, allow me to offer this. The best thing I can do is to compliment Mr Satejowski on the ambition to make his own film and to put it out there for an audience to see. But the hope that this movie will be downloaded and distributed is simply judged visions of greatness. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the movie has a promise (and let's see it, at this point it won't come from acting, writing or guidance), this is this: If, IF, the people associated with this movie are willing, then please learn from This movie, archive it, and use the experience you have gained from your next attempt. Don't attack your critics or make a friend or family do it for you. If you are able to do this, the next might be worth distributing, worthy of being called a "movie". <br /> <br /> I'm your audience and I'm willing to see.
