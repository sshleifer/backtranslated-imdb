I rented this movie because I noticed the lid in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's timing and thought "hmm, it can't be that bad." Unfortunately, after seeing it, my impression was "not too good". It's a kind of Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is the other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But it's a decent movie to watch when I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she didn't get a chance to be a nuisance.
