First of all, the whole idea of ​​remake a classic like "Psycho" is nothing short of ridiculous. A lot of time and effort was wasted here. I am sure they are wise enough to know that they could not improve the original, so they must have had a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock on their thoughts. But the idea that began as a benevolent tribute results in being a blow to the face of the horror master. This movie is poorly produced, badly acted and unnecessary at first. The original classic stands well on its own even after 40 years. The hitch coming back from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of waste is unlikely, but if I were them I would sleep with an eye openly in case. Do not waste your time.
