Okay, so it would never change the world and it was bombed at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of the movies I fell in love with as a kid (the BBC showed it a couple of times in the 1980s and I happen to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine - lucky it!) and so endlessly. I watched the DVD last night, and unfortunately the time has not been good for this. Either that or I just grew out of this kind of broad, dopey humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for grin, he gives us close-ups of news pants with "funny" slogans, what can you say about the cast or the manuscript? It's certainly ambitious, interesting, unusual, and bubbly, but it's never even ridiculously amazing. I will describe it as a children's movie with some "adult" overtones - you can probably let your young people see this despite the 15 certificate. They won't get the drug references, so don't worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I had forgotten how captivating both the title song and the songwriter car's 'Everybody's Going Faster, Faster' song was, not to mention the patriotic anthem of the city of Ticlaw. The whole cast gives commendable performances, the photography is sharp and captures the atmosphere of the various locations perfectly, and there is a real-time capsule of fashion, cars, gadgets (especially dashboard-mounted drum machine), the interior and pop culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone, "I'm OJ Simpson!", especially now the Simpson's legal tangles overshadowed his sporting performance. Snag is, there is almost no plot to talk about, it's too obvious to be witty and not fun enough to evoke many real laughs. I wish I had left this as a pleasant memory.
