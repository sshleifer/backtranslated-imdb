The film producers hope Cameron Diaz's name will help sell this image. Unfortunately, nothing can save what is already on the screen. Despite some beautifully shot European rankings and some solid production design elements, the film fails mainly because of its awkward, incredible romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An unpleasant movie experience.
