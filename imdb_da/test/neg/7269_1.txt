This movie is horrible. First, I thought it could appeal to children because of the cozy Ewoks, the rage of little people from Stars Wars. After reading this movie in a movie, I'm sure not even a 4 year old would find this movie interesting. Special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well with other 80's television films. The writing is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad, and the girl is so predictable that I still can't believe I couldn't touch the forward button on my VCR. But I came close to changing this mess from more than once.
