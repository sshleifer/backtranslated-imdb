I found the 'Shuttle' an incredibly frustrating movie to watch. It starts quite well and moves fast to the first 'damage' (which is a doozy). Then it becomes very lazy and ascribed to a story. That was the case with the plot running the characters and not the characters that ran the plot. If you hate movies where you can't understand why characters do what they do, you'll scare 'Shuttle'. Especially the last action is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also, at the end, one of the characters confessed a past offense to his friend, rather than creating sympathy from the audience, most of whom began to giggle. It was probably because history's "heroines" were a complete fool. Finally, there is an end that just seems to be "shocking" and comes from the frightened cop-out school of "people are bad, the audience, so just accept it without any explanation". <br /> <br /> 'Shuttle' is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. And annoying.
