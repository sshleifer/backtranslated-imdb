I can't believe this is a movie I didn't like. . . I usually find myself open minded about all sorts of things. . . But this flick is just, well, bad. <br /> <br /> If the script and story were better, I could handle the topic. I could handle the actor if the camera's work was better or if the characters were better established. . . I think it boils down mainly to script and direction itself. <br /> <br /> It was just bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this the lowest rating, however. . . I don't believe it, at least this guy knocked off the tail to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating this has so far)
