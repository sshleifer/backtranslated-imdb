I've always wanted Bill Murray in movies like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently discovered that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown because he left a big shoe, his creaking nose and his main heritage, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 miles in four days and give him a safe $ 30,000 zoo. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are tiny moments of humor that a truck's front bends forward, and Murray is screaming, but overall it's meaningless. Very poor!
