"Love and human remnants" is one of the obviously scripts, obviously acted, of course staged flicks, which are so obvious that the escape velocity from its constructions and fabrication is beyond me. It is not worth explaining, this amateur flick tries to slam all the clever lines, every misanthropic overtone, any peculiar sexual propensity to a film of lack of concern to make the pieces fit. In short, sensationalist shit without feeling ... which basically just leaves crap.
