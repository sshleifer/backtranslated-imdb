I doubt who wrote this script ever read Mansfield Park ... or if they did, it wasn't that good. None of the signs are what they should be: Fanny is lively and conscious of her abuse, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, apparently has fallen to Aunt Norris personality. In addition, a first person's story of Fanny is very inappropriate for both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would argue she is not supposed to be. In addition, Fanny shamelessly flips with Edmund from the beginning when they are raised as a brother and sister! Austen's Fanny would have shrunk by any kind of flirting, and the novel paints the Fanny / Edmund mating as very unpleasant ... as it should be. Unlike some other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a very different kind of novel than the others; It is not supposed to be a love story. I watched this movie because I just finished reading Mansfield Park, and I'm horrified by what I see; Miss Austen rolls in her grave.
