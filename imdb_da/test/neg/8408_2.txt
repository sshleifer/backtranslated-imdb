The first movie is something good for me, I mostly enjoyed it, but I thought it was really nothing special. But in comparison to this mess, it looks a lot much better. Why they felt the need to make the movie past me, but they should have known that it could not match the play of the first movie as they could only get Ruth Gordon back to reproduce his role. The story kind of follows Rosemary's baby around and things, but in reality it's a bit messy, it doesn't help that the movie is a television movie, and the television series shines through very well. It also has a comedy tone to it that prevents it much, if they really felt the need to make a sequel, they should have made it to an R-rated movie that had some nudity and do it. I'm sure it would still be pretty bad, but at least it would have been more attentive and fun as this movie is not in spite of trying to be fun. I saw this at Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really to say about it in the intro, nor did I have much to say. I must say that it was a successor who should never have seen the light of day.
