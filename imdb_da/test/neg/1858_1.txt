Jerry Angell, owner of the zombie horror finest mullet, returns for more undead action in the sequel to director Todd Sheets' terrible homemade gore party Zombie Bloodbath. This time, Jerry plays a snail-free life-long life, along with his despicable partner-in-crime, some escaped prisoners, several teens and a bunch of screaming girls, face to face with a horde of shambling, carnivorous bodies. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have learned Zilch to improve his craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath, and Sheets delivers another scary mess on a movie that somehow manages to be even worse than that original ?? One thing I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The action is uniformly miserable, the effects are amateurish and cheap (most of the gore doesn't seem to be anything but a selection of offcuts, offal and blood from the local butcher's shop), the story incomprehensible (as far as I can understand, the zombies rise from the dead, because a scarecrow commands them to !!!) and the direction frustrated with cheap-looking video effects and totally meaningless cuts to black and white. And as if it wasn't enough to convince you of this movie's complete lack of redeeming features, the simply scary moronic end should do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently stashes meat-eating bacteria on its passenger seat just the case of dissolving the undead (but oddly enough, not at all damaging the living).
