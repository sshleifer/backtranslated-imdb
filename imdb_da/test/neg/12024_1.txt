What to say about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so shameful. Plays, writing, effects and everything in this movie were just awful. It doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of waste I've ever had to sit through. That's also why I stopped it approx. 20 minutes before the end because I did not care for anything that happened to the characters. I've seen bad, but it was definitely the worst. I got hyped up for this because I'm a fan of Poe and it was just bad. Just bad. <br /> <br /> What disturbs me more is that you can't judge movies with negative numbers.
