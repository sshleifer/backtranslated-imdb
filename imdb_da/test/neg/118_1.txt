Honestly horrible movie, poor editing, horrible lighting, gloomy dialogue and scrappy manuscript. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad, there are moments you can't even see what's going on, I even tried to play with contrast and brightness so I could see something, but it didn't help. <br /> <br /> They must have found the script in a box, the character evolution is just as awful, and while hardly expecting much of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie this one can hit an all-hour low. You can't even laugh at cheesy'ness. The management and editing are also horrible, the entire movie follows an extremely tired routine and fails every turn as it stumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal. There is not much else to say than it is really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's previous work that you could enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid as the record, frankly, words fail me to condemn this "movie".
