OK, what was this story about again? I'm afraid I never read the book and honestly, it was one of the most confusing movies I've ever tried to watch for a long time. I get a little confused about the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man without the thumbs. The film didn't really explain what they were looking for in the desert before they found it; or even how in the world they all knew. <br /> <br /> Having watched the "Pride and Prejudice" movie with Colin Firth, I have tried to study his movie career by watching other movies from his and other than "What a Girl Want" I didn't find much where he played in it was something good. I'm definitely not saying he wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I've seen in the modern movie, but the content and quality of the movies he plays in has a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is another perfect example of where the director, author and crew are just too close to their topic to see the viewer not getting the picture ?? literally. The whole movie seemed to be presenting Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emotion that was a drill. Nothing is really explained, and each of the topics from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalytic evaluation! <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories that stand in front of an all-male audience and titles other men than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays his husband, does not necessarily have all his marble in place and must be a secret agent ?? I think; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry Colin!) Who thinks he knows it all. The rest of the casting is cast (pun intended) for the four winds while the plot wanders. <br /> <br /> The structure of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unpleasant taste. But of course, the viewer looks at how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex for the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no structure. Just a pat, bam, thank you! <br /> <br /> And is it not romantic that Fiennes ended up with a traitor who helped the Germans by giving them shortly to the desert? (sarcasm) To describe this movie, I would simply say, "How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, sweet man who loves you." <br /> <br /> The final incredible part of this plot is to understand how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents ?? In fact, when I saw the movie, I thought it should have been one of his first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two-second clip worth watching in the movie. Thus, I have no interest in seeing it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the plane crash, where Firth is trying to take them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes were quite neat, though.
