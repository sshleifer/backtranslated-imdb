A seriously backward step for the puppets in this mainly boring and boring excursion. Guy Rolfe, as amazing as Andre Toulon in Part Three, hardly has this time, and Richard Band's amazing tune appears with the puppets a few minutes into the movie. To the start of the film, we are introduced to the Vice-President of the Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his friend friends (many of whom are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately pretty incredible roles - Teresa Hill is pretty yummy). Totems, minions of the Egyptian God Sutek will have the secret of the animation's life back and the puppets (when they surface) work with a previously invisible wisdom to try to destroy the ugly and much computer game that looks Totems. Totemsne only complicates the series and distracts from the things that previously made the series so unique - they do not share the peculiar beauty of the puppet and thus do not really fit in. The top stage is Pinhead with a cloth to cleanse blood from Tunnelborers living, classic and about the most adorable this movie goes. The fifth film was filmed at the same time, so expect similar parts of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seem to have been filmed in another era (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and the series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr.
