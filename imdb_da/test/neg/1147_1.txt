Why oh, why should they try to make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies from any time? The film is a train wreck at all levels and should never have been made. Randy Quaid's cousin Eddie's depiction is one of the top caricatures of his former cousins ​​Eddie. Also, Eddie's character is not interesting enough to carry a whole movie. Even the "eye candy" Sung Hi Lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap. Don't waste your time on this step, just watch the original again.
