While being credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team, but a former Mutt and Jeff rip-off with those who go to Africa and indulge in the stereotypical burning cork makeup to try to blend get in. While dialect humor is mostly paralyzed, there is a short musical sequence involving "black skeletons" that were entertaining. However, I have to ask how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay even after being dumped in the water a few times? One of many items produced by Van Beuren Corporation for distribution of RKO Radio Pictures before RKO got an agreement with Disney. Only worth seeing if you are an animation buff or interested in how some ethnic groups became stereotypical as entertainment way back when.
