Governance was by far a very pitiful movie. I don't use this word loosely as it was honestly a bad excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ?? "Why"? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of each scene in this movie and it seems to fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to lack of development (both in the story and in the characters), which ultimately lead to a very confusing movie with actors going through the movements rather than giving any explanation. Scenes would occur without shaking, understanding or driving to a complete end. It was as if I saw several different ideas thrown together without really any decision. Actors set events up and running that didn't seem to fit their character or really were solved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and complete lack of structure for this film crumbled all the spots of the foundation with a true "ripple effect" that felt in the rest of the film as a result. <br /> <br /> Let me explain further to this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would listen to this movie for a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it. It had no meaning, nor was there any logic behind it all. Minnie Driver was the worst sinner in this deed. Her character lines were drawn very fuzzy and almost transparent. She wanted to do things like talking about sex all the time with her sister, yet she seemed to be very open to sexual experiences all the time. She has her first moment of passion in this movie and there is no pain or excitement. It happens unfortunate, and it just didn't seem to fit the original conversation we had at the start of the movie with Rosina and her sister. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to her invention? It was confusing and completely random. It is not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods did not exist. Anyone in their right mind could see that she didn't teach Cavendish's daughter anything. The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly formed between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost laughed me. Perhaps I thought I might have discovered some magic in this movie, as Rhys-Meyers literally "popped" into the scene and suddenly caused some unnecessary drama. It felt like the director (or the author) was thinking that the original story didn't go fast, so by adding this random character we might be able to make the plot a little (or confuse the smaller movie enthusiasts). Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was almost a "cut-and-paste" character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Don't let me get started at the end, which had no connection with the rest of the story. Again, using the "cut-and-paste" method, the author of this movie needed a way to just end the story, and that was the only solution they could come to. It's boring when the actors are forced to do things out of character? but I think it's the name of the game in Hollywood. Fix until completely destroyed, or at least salvable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was unexciting dribble. There were perhaps a handful of quirky cinematographic moments where you could see that there was a crooked creativity trying to break through with some pillars of decent, period music, but nothing to write to Grandma about. More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this movie a little more, but as I said earlier, leaving open scenes just around the entire movie, you will experience a crack in your foundation. What may seem like a solid story will eventually wear down over time, and at the end of this movie, I felt the house crumbled over me. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this movie while Driver apparently would not be naked, but everyone else also had (I will have to see a doctor after the pictures were burned in my eyes? Eeewwww). She also had the same dress every day. It was disgusting and I could smell her through the TV. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there is a good movie for you! There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just a nonsense. Nothing was answered, issues seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to rule at the top. <br /> All in all, this could have been a decent movie that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pathetic. I cannot stress the disturbing fact that signs went through movements without any explanation. I do not need cinematic moments handed down to me as a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. Just remember oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were so confused about what I was, then you will completely understand the movie The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal? then this movie might be for you! <br /> <br /> Degree: * Out of *****
