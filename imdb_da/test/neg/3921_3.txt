Of course, influenced by Pal's 'Destination Moon' success and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this just doesn't cut. Limited special effects, a thin storyline result in a production that even the half-decent throw cannot save. Just no credibility here. No one seems surprised to encounter the Martians, like the landlords, etc. Beware!
