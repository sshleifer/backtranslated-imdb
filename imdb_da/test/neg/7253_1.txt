And I'm afraid I can't imagine why. It's really a really grim and exceptionally boring movie. In some ways, it resembles early science fiction, as each set had been posted on a Hollywood back mass out of what was around. From the small and unconvincing set (snipers seem to be about ten feet away) apparently made of plaster, to the actors who also apparently are made of plaster with "entertaining" stereotypes painted thinly upstairs to the strange hot pool in a frozen cave to The survival of those cast effortlessly when medium artillery shells burst a few feet away on open ground and finally the horrible script that looks like a training guide more than a movie .... I really can't say how boring it is. Even the opportunity to see if young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me in mind for more than an hour. This really is one that must be avoided at all costs.
