I can't see what's all about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the film charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want all the benefits of this, buy Patricia's CD and enjoy it! The reason is simple (if one omits the "dreams"); The main characters seem to love each other immediately and also forget their other acquaintances immediately. The conditions seem almost "mandatory" and the little "detective story" thrown in, just makes it worse. What first appeared to be a perfect movie ends, is first turned up and then looks like a dream. I measure movies know how well I will remember them, and for this I have already begun to forget the details.
