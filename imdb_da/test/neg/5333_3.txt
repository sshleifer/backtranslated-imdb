This 'documentary' certainly does not portray what it would be like to be backstage during the Hard Knock Life tour. Granted, I wasn't there, but seeing this movie didn't make me feel like I was. And for a movie like this, it's not exactly a compliment. All the time I saw it, all I could think was "What are they going out?" When it's all over, you just feel that you have some insight into DMX, and it's primarily because he's just talking about his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
