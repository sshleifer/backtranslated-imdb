When I post this comment, IMDb currently evaluates Alfred Hitchcock's subpar Saboteur a 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rated it less than half of it. Honestly, I can't tell how a movie this bad could have come from, what is probably the most consistently good director I know of. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30s-60s. Vertigo is so far my hands down favorite, while Saboteur is easily the worst. It is hard to believe that Hitch spent 7 years earlier the same formula in The 39 Steps far more competent. My recommendation would be to see it instead and avoid this like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie that I turned off before at the end and didn't want to go back and see the rest. If you need to see it, rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made and buy the DVD in good faith, earned through Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear window etc. Even a master screws up sometimes, I think. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little harder on this movie than I should have been. It is certainly not near Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that, but there are three reasons I feel I should judge it so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings with it expect certain quality expectations. This movie delivers on a few of them, but they are far overshadowed by the darnet near non-sensual plotting. <br /> <br /> 2) I'd like to compensate a little for all the 8+ reviews this movie is getting. Hitchcock is like John Coltrane of Directors. True fans will find reasons for considering some of him a work of art, but the high rating on IMDb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it really is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 on this. Maybe if it would cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I would probably be a bit less bitter. ;)
