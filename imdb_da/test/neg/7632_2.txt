Sorry I couldn't be more expressive in my summary, but these two words seemed to describe the movie perfectly. This is not just a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will be insignificant to most viewers. See it only for a naked Rebecca De Mornay tied to a chain-link fence and groaning with 'ecstasy; supposedly 'erotic', but actually fun. <br /> <br />
