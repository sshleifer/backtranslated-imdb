Based on David Ignatius' 2007 novel, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) sent to Jordan to track an al-Qaeda mastermind while constantly stepping on a narrow trait of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American chief Ed Hoffman (Crowe). Anyone who has seen trailers could be forgiven for believing that the story is about double agent action and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman, but the real story is much more mundane. Instead, we served a weak broth of ridiculous underwater birds like the white beautiful boy. American Ferris moves with virtual impunity through Amman Jordan's crooked streets with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of the attention of locals. Only during a scene where Ferris takes his new-found Iranian girl out for tea disturbs reality when the couple is bombarded with glares from Jordanian men. Comparing the film's problems is plot twists that seem to be designed as nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris is expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to Britain, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children ?? one on it goes. These are the kinds of things you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In bodily loyalty to his craft, Crowe achieved an impressive 63 pound flab for the role of Ed Hoffman, and joined the small select club of actors composed of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as thespians who have exposed to massive weight gain or loss to their roles. It's all too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's commitment to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better movie on our hands than this sub-parameter.
