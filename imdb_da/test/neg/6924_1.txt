Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer, while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Luckily for Chloe, Chloe gets big on sitcom and is temporarily moved to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen books a flight to LaLa Land, as a surprise. When he comes to her semi-trailer, "the house" screams when Chloe and her fucking star have a little romantic touch. The author and the actor are through. Hurt and sour like a hat, Owen goes back to NYC. Sympathetic friends decide to put him on a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his sulky funk. But it goes awry when the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly because each has a strong personality and Owen's huge shoulder chip. But in the next few months, Nadine and Owen will be astonishing, friends who trust each other and hang out. Could it be something more? Well, who cares! This movie is so boring that most people will release it from the DVD player after the first ten minutes. Scripture is pathetic, gloomy, and, oh, too stupid. So again, Krumholtz also gives a very disgusting and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who can look good with the lines she is supposed to choke? William Baldwin also reaches a career low with his raw and sex-grained role as Owen's brother. The only throwing member that is good is Richards, but she must ring when she looks back on this. Okay, costumes and production values ​​are appropriate. There is also a wise element in the characters occasionally speaking their lines, but cartoon bubbles appear over their heads with the words of what they really think. It does not save the movie from the "bomb" status. Don't be stupid, dear movie and romcom lovers. Don't rent, buy or borrow this gigantic turkey. I'm the stupidest person on earth today to see this thing to the bitter end.
