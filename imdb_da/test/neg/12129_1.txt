John Waters owes me 2 hours in my life back. I saw a sneak preview screening of this road back in 1990, and I'm still in pain. Not sooner or later I have seen such a horrible piece of cinematic waste spit on the screen. There is nothing positive I can say about this movie. Acting - horrible; plot - ridiculous; music - cruel. After the movie, my friends and I demanded our money back from the theater manager. He explained that as it was a free screening, he could not give us anything in return, no matter how much pain we suffered. How Johnny Depp's career survived this train crash of a movie is anyone's guess.
