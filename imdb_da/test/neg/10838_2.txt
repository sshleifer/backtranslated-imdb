This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has recorded. Ben Affleck must be behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is certainly his forte and it is not. I actually spent 54 minutes in this movie before I was so sad I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a drilling from the beginning to just over 54 minutes in the movie anyway. The priest of "Guess what happened to me on the way to ...." has been done again and again to death. Somehow, there seems to be no fun or romantic about people who cheat each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be an appropriate movie for your teenage children, especially those who can see Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where the authors / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint .... while driving .... and then have no consequences whatsoever when you stay caught. I'm not bragging, and I smoked my share when I was younger, but I guarantee you, I won't take my teens to see it, and they're solid A&B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats" which I think are two of her best works.
