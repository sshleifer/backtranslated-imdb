I went into Blockbuster, itchin 'to watch some good old-fashioned action movies. So I looked around the action section until this film got my attention because the cover had a big letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R! YAY! Although I will admit I prefer her in a comedy, but if it's something like 'Speed', then I was sold. Unfortunately, Sandra is not in this movie, her role is smaller: "Panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (She is fifth in the actors' list of Jeebus shakes!) It was apparently her first movie role (and after watching this movie, I figured it out much) Sandra is the only living person in this movie, everyone else might as well be a zombie in a B-Horror Girl. This movie deceives me and says Sandra was the leader. . . I fell for it as Biff from 'Back to the Future' when Marty shouts "WHAT IS IT .... !!!" God, I wish I saw it instead of this. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this movie every time she's on camera, it's as if she's getting caches and shouting "CLEAR!" To get these movies going, but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. More about Sandra later. . . <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. Very boring. Think of the most hidden moment in your life, so imagine living through that moment in 110 minutes (for me it is this movie). This movie somehow makes the Gun Gun and Bullet timings dull, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers become shameful. And this movie's idea of ​​Bullet Time is a close-up of a slow-motion AK that mocks you as the capes spit it out, representing every second of your life as it slowly disappears. And I knew I saw a bad movie because I found myself sending "THROUGH-THE-ACTION!" The plot? . . . there was a plot? Music? . . . Even at the 80's, the muck standard is poor but at least it is the only thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and good. . . ummm. . . move on. Is it good because it is classified R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules snooze party. And it's really the 80s Cliché when a movie opens with an overview of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ball) and ends with a gun fight in an ugly factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. Both of these films meet. At least this film states which era it is unnecessary since Sandra's hair screamed "the 1980s". And a movie really gets ham fisted when you see a assassin stripper killing a geek in the bathroom and emptying his body into a box that you respond to unfortunately says, "It's probably the most action that bad sap ever got." Another Hammy moment is at the beginning when some-Secret-Agent-Dude throw a lot of people and apparently this movie looks people up in the air and falls to the ground when they die. All that was needed was Mario Death, or maybe Contra sound effects, but Nintendo could have sued. <br /> <br /> And that's boring when the main action in this movie rips off other BETTER movie icons. Before the big weapon scene, Da Hero found standing in a boxing ring ('Rocky' anyone?), With a leather fedora (not also Indiana Jones) with a spooky spotlight behind him (Terminator the 2nd before he owns T-1000) What really is really sorry it is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) saw this movie. I am serious, most Rant videos recorded with poor sound and blurred image are more entertaining than this movie. I can't even call this movie with the given name because it's very name, bringing back horrible memories of seeing this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation of human rights!) The only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is Sandra's career began to start thanks to this movie. But oh Sandra. . . Why should you be in such a nightmare? The payslip was worth better. The DVD also gives you a little back story on Sandra as an extra, seen how she is the only one from this movie that ends up being a household name. Which explains why this movie uses its name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I don't have much experience with bad movies, but I know badly when I see it. I could jump back from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good old campy Bruce Willis Comedy. But not even Bruce could encourage me for this movie. I haven't seen any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm amped for them now. Because I can't even get a movie worse then. . . "GAG". . . 'Hangmen'. . .
