Well, frankly, it's beyond the boundaries of stupid, but "Killer Pussy" is still a scary entertaining little flick. No plot, tons of oiled cha-chas, cheesy effects and a penis eating monster! What is not to love?! Exactly a lot - a couple of explorers find this creature who likes to nestle in a woman's curtains until a swan is unfortunately ... ah, bumped into her mouth. It finds the host later discovered frozen in an abandoned house by a group of moronic guys and their equally mindless, blind lovers, whose van collapses. The creature jumps from each girl as they are all mocked as drunk rabbits. There is some cheap gore, girl-on-girl "blood clot", KY Jelly vomit, sock socks and lots of soft-core sex. Ridiculous but a cold waste of time ...
