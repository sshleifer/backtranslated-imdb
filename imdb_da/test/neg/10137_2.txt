My parents can enjoy this show, but I fail to find humor in it. What's so funny about a dentist man impregnating his hygienic assistant and the oldest daughter being impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes, what people think is humor today. Blam it on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" that brings the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, but it's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. This is nothing like the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy" some five decades before. <br /> <br /> An answer I wanted why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel is because the channel's brass thinks women can relate to Reba's character! I absolutely do not like the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Fun, I wonder if the actor who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers, in fact, is away from acting. Who plays blockhead ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is ditsy in itself! The people in Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator Allison M. Gibson decided to put the series in where I live 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, she is an oklahoman! Why has it decided during a season or more to make the random music sound like a pig snorting? What I mean by this is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums that accompany it, but the tunes are basically tuneless!
