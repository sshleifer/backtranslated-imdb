"The Love Letter" is one of the movies that could have been really clever, but they wasted it. Focusing on a letter that breaks chaos into a small town, the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had so recently been in the super-hilarious "In & Out" (also about disturbance in a small town), where they were both big, but here they look as if they get drugs all over. I can't tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything), but they certainly haven't achieved anything. How tragic that a potential grin lift was so sadly wasted.
