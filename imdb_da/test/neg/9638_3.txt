This is one of the so-called "Hollywood Social Commentary" films that want it both ways. And believe me, in this movie, both ways are clich√© and stereotype. STOP-LOSS is a 21st Century John Wayne Film, dealing with some anti-war mood, but obviously ending the note that "If you are a man in today's society, you get your action together and march at war with your friends. " In many ways, the movie was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE as it portrayed a military as crazy and out of control, blending a quasi FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza into a Texas Red Neck world of oppressed gay -erotic evidence of masculinity. This movie had everything in one scene after another of cliched pictures. And the rebellious military deserts Ryan Phillippe goes on a "Road Trip" with the best friend's boyfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead soldiers, soldiers in military hospitals, etc. And finally, ask the question of fleeing to Canada or Mexico. But male honor and patriotism eventually win out, as all newly flounder and beautiful, he rides into the sunset on a bus with his friends back to Iraq and a world a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never tolerate. FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne rides again! And a Hollywood Blockbuster ultimately keeps both sides of the audience in the palm of your hand. It would at least think about it. As far as I was concerned, just take me back to the more convincing reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
