I was once a great Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and saw it almost uninterrupted until I was nine. Then it was on my shelf to collect dust for yesterday. I was left speechless. Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds who are sent to Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as you might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside. <br /> <br /> The reason is predictable, and humor is low and grainy. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two superficial girls with too much makeup on their face. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you're not in Olsen twins or family movies.
