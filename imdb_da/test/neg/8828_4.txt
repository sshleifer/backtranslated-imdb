It is quite possible that I simply did not give the movie a reasonable chance because it was so unappealing for me (something similar happened to Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have caught on when I put the movie on and my roommate , an exchange student from Japan, immediately started laughing at the movie and said it sounded silly. Now I do not agree that it is silly, the animation is very simple, but clearly very skilled. It is like classical animation with added layers that adds another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the surreal realm at the same time. <br /> <br /> But the subject is completely uncomfortable for me. It has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is packed in such an unpleasant package that it is hardly worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. The sound effects, while the man is listening loudly to cherries and cherries, is actually contradictory. <br /> <br /> There was a clever animation scene as we deeply immersed into the hole the man finds in his head as he pulls the soap out of the scalp, but so long it seems to overshadow everything else. There is so much stock put in one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it. As I said about Triplets of Belleville, would it have been a good thing for a television program like adult swimming, or its Japanese counterpart, but a nominated movie for the film award? It gives me the impression that there is generally not a long list of animated short films that the academy can choose from.
