I would like this movie. I really did. I was so excited when I saw the previve, scared hell out of me. But when I saw the actual movie, I was disappointed. The play is stolen and the attempt at comedy is out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy chased by a turd in a bed frame is not fun or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know very little. Many facts in the film are right on the target, but this movie should have been much better. The whole birthday scene lasts for example. About fifteen minutes, nothing adds to the listing or story and it should have been left on the floor. A more heavy-handed editor might have gotten a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> I understand in no way, form or form involved in the second Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb listing. I'm just telling you what it is.
