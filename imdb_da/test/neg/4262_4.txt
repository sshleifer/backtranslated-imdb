Amitabh and Jiah Khan made great hopes for their press conferences, even though it was quite easy for critics and fans that all this very hype Ram Gopal Verma Factory product will fall flat on that face, in all likelihood! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, blamed and uncertain. they did not know what the hell they were talking about, to the press, stop the tag line, that some love stories should not be understood, or such nonsense! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu needs to update his knowledge of Sanskrit, when Vidhu Vinod is to study Mahabharata, queuing, another glorious flop of the year, Eklavya! Comparison with the sweet hearts and Lolit is inevitable since the so-called plot line must have been inspired by them. But unfortunately, Ramu has hardly made any serious effort to thrust deep into the aging psyche and the young. is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of innocence? And, unlike this line of childhood, the leg at the dining table, with a Vijay, is Bacchan in the role that shrinks in shameless laughter incessantly for departments? This girl is actually in her seductive game, luring poor Vijay to think she is in love with him. The legs are also low enough and the action of putting the water hose through the legs is downright oblique. It is beyond one's understanding, how can a girl who comes as a guest to any body of the body be so bustling, brash and overriding? and why hell, the stupid wife played by Revathi, remarkably good, though outlined poorly and characterized unrealistically, encourages her own husband to dance with a sexy saying young girl? The part of Vijay trying to get some refreshers for his humdrum life is absolutely unclear. because it seems he is happy as he is, with a well-determined life and a hobby to recreate. This is reminiscent of Blame's on Rio, the older father and his young love played excellently by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks awful in close-ups and everywhere where as Kevin spacey and Jeremy Irons so debonair and stylish, the young chickens are sometimes attracted to older men for their charming person over the vulnerability of young boys of their age. The only good thing about this movie is the green, bubbly landscapes, winding roads and comfortable movies. No matter or even a sparkling show of emotion, drama or even exciting, stormy sex like in Lolita, this low-profile movie is no wonder, fell flat on the face and had to run off the screen during the first few weeks! Next time round, before mindlessly copying such a theme from Hollywood, Ramu must do his homework, and Bacchan should think twice! You can't fool all people at all times, Mr. Bacchan!
