You will probably get something like this. I translate movies into live and this is the first movie in my 5 year business experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. Of course, there are stupid Hollywood films about drunken teens on a spring break, but these films do not even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a confused (and often ridiculous) story, a lot of different scenes, pretentious dialogue ... Then you get the worst kind of movie that another reviewer very precisely defined as "pretentious shit" . To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it is your intelligence and your imagination, of course you used to try to make a sense of this pitiful attempt (it is in our human nature to try to make sense ). <br /> <br /> One more thing: I can tolerate politically incorrect very well, I am far too artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much. I wish someone told the director that it is a little ridiculous (even in an unrealistic film) to portray a Slavic woman as a semi-articulate disheveled creature associated with the forces of nature, probably because she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.
