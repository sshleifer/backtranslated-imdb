Whether the overall social message of this movie - the vigilant justice is acceptable - is justified, I was more offended by McConaughey's final statement. In a courtroom drama, the defense attorney's final statement is basically the core of the film, and when the question is so difficult to solve like this, the statement is really delivered to the audience as well as the jury. This basically implies that the audience is considering rape of a white girl to be a more horrible crime than the rape of a black girl. I for one find this very offensive. As for the rest, I found the acting reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to play his usual bubbling self (does not really work in a drama of the courtroom), but what is meant when the movie's message is as bad as this one. It tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
