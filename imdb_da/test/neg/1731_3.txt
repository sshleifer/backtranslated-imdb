My summary refers to the fact that this movie has 1479 votes - only 21 cards to make it eligible to be on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list - the 100 lowest rated movies on the site. With a poor score of only 1.8, this would place the film at approx. between 38 and 46 on the list - talk about a very questionable achievement !! My score of 3 is not that bad - but it brings the movie so closer to the dreaded list. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie, the once cute Aaron Carter - yet another packaged and forgettable pop star from the 1990s. When he first broke on stage, he was a sweet kid with some songs that appealed to pre-teens and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, appearance and image were all carefully cared for and created by crowds and did the trick - which led to some great album sales. Unfortunately, sales in 2005 were down, and Carter had hit his awkward lifestyle - something ALL children his age has to do with eventually. To put it whole, he is no longer adorable in this movie and is in a very hard stage in life. I suppose he is a beautiful young man ... but in "Popstar" he is no longer the heartbeat he once was. Here he is just very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position as a "pop sensation". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film features some other ex-teen heart-throbs from the last few decades - including a role for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know how to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to assemble the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a good example of a pop star whose life after the star has been a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will take Cassidy in the future, and so far he has happily managed to avoid the negative advertising and courtesy of many ex-pop idols. I was far from enthusiastic about the movie, but wished him a lot in this section. It is not his fault that he was patched across radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Carter doesn't even have to stretch himself - he plays a pop star. But despite getting millions and being thrilled by girls, he doesn't have "the whole thing". He is pretty close - mostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides not to be a resident of him anymore - forcing him to attend primary school. The problem, however, is that he is pretty phobic about taking samples ... and it's hard to make character in school. So he gets the idea of ​​finding a smart girl to date - one that would obviously be obliged to help him out in school. He chooses the sweet but book Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> By the way, this plot is not bad and can work even though it seems like an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon sit-com. Well, it's predictable, and you know the formula will mean she'll eventually learn her plot and get hurt, and he will eventually realize that he actually takes care of her AND at the end of the movie everyone will be forgiven and they will be a true couple. But given good acting and competent direction, this can be worth seeing for his teenage fans, who are predictably not always bad. And as it turned out, it's NOT exactly where the plot went ... but it was very close. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things I liked about the movie. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens player Jens grandparents was very nice - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. Also the 1970s made for television movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film - it was nice to see him again - although some of me hated him as he looks so good after all these years, and I ever look a little out my 45 years! He did a good job and it was great to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> With regard to Carter, with his many past experiences on television, he was not surprisingly pretty good. While his relationship with Jane did not seem very credible, he and Mrs Austin gave the best. The movie wasn't great, but they tried, and I think most of the problems with the movie were in the writing - with a better and less formal plot it could have worked much better. Plus, the whole "testophobia" angle seemed quite constructed ... and quite insignificant. Who cares about a mega-millionaire star getting anxious about trying out school? Overall, not a rotten movie as the current rating would mean, although there is not much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him. For them, there is no nostalgic value in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett advises Aaron. I felt like screaming "don't listen !!" but didn't!
