Like most people I rented this after I heard the universal praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre inexplicable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the movie. Then the two women went to "performance" late in the evening. The rest of the movie (which is still 40 minutes by the way) is even WEIRDER than the first part and completely contradicts and dumps what I had already seen. Then the movie ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Confused, I walked over to my computer to see if I could buy a clue what just happened. Nothing was sensible, and I'm a beautiful wise guy. None of these other user comments made sense even when they say "SPOILERS." I still have no idea what they say. Any dream? Not really? So what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's "not right?" Or is it right? I'm forced to choose. Either: <br /> <br /> [a] The movie is a genius at a MENSA level, and I'm simply too stupid to understand it. <br /> <br /> [b] The movie is strange to nice and doesn't make sense. Everyone who loves it tries to save face and pretend to "get it". <br /> <br /> I choose [b]. Screw, I'm going home ...
