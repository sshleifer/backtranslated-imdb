Can you stop believing everything that this man says. Get your facts right before you start praising this liar. He's not even <br /> <br /> from Flint. He just says it to keep his "blue collar" look. He is <br /> <br /> from a rich suburb next to Flint. He believes he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, it seems certain they have suffered a lot from Flint to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, it makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he'd just move there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million New York apartment. It's the working class right there. I certainly can't wait for his DVD set to come out. Here I want to talk about how big companies are bad. Where do I get the DVDs? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest companies in America, which were also the only two stores, were allowed to sell them.
