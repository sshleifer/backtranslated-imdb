If this movie won the Lumiere Award for Best French Language Film, what kind of garbage comes out of France these days? <br /> <br /> The topic is an important one - how the African economies are held as financial hostages by international organizations to help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of state budgets in several African nations pay for Western debt while their people suffer from disease, dehydration, and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject was dealt with in the most arduous way that could be devised by man-dander than the Sahara surrounding the country of Mali, where this film takes place. More monotony and action missing than any documentary I have ever seen (and I am a fan of the genre), a "witness" after another emerges in this "test" that is "captured" on films condemning the world Bank & IMF. Some critics can place the colorful visual pages in the movie, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better in a coffee table than in this movie. Even the characters in the movie say something like "This test is boring" and "When will it be over?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were the people on the screen reading our minds ?? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a short look in this movie. It is a TV movie in "Bamako" and it was set in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti-western I have ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was when a Caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an African woman wearing a baby and shows no remorse at all. Perhaps it was symbolizing the World Bank's insensitivity and how it accidentally kills Africans. <br /> <br /> And a final technical farewell shot was difficult to read with so many bright colors on the screen and not enough black outline for the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I've already summed up the movie for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to watch this movie. You never get these two hours back in your life.
