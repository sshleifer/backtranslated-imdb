Despite strong notions by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this movie fails to ignite the viewers' imagination. By the way, what has become of Ms Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> This for me was almost like an 1850 version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With his father's death, the driver dies a position as governor of a Christian family who stores his Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> While I realize this is a peacetime, it was terribly boring even for 1850 England and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The house lady is most annoying with her song-song voice. I expected her to refer to Driver as dear at any time. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know the driver is trying to pass himself as a Christian, but does this name mean all the way? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love for the young lawyer's father (Wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, all we see is that Mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography. Should we really be exposed to what happened throughout the film? <br /> <br /> The early stages of Judaism practiced in 19th century England and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played more. There is a certain underlying sense of anti-Semitism by the Wilkinson family, but it must never come out.
