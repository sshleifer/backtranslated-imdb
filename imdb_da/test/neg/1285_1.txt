What a waste of precious time! My 5-year-old daughter brought this home from my mother's house and we saw it as a family. None of us liked it. This miserable little movie, with sharp disagreements, obvious Christian themes, and horrible movie quality, is not worth seeing for yourself on a trip. It felt a bit like a poor high school drama class attempt at film making. How sad to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and company) flood their way through this trite and eerie story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film may have gone directly to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent watching paint dry.
