I have enjoyed seeing Lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when Lost is good, it's really good! But this episode, containing Mr Echo's death, had so many drawn-out scenes with long-lasting close-ups of bad acting that I found myself pressing the fast-forward button. This episode was by far the worst. In fact, the variation in Lost's quality has become so inconsistent that I often wonder how many authors they use. <br /> <br /> I will continue to see but hope things get better and I hope to stop secretly wanting for the part-actors in the series to die off.
