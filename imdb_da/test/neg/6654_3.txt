Now the plot is entertaining, but it's full of goof. To sum it up, the cop / dad would like to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the transplant from the criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Well the criminal agrees, but escaped to the hospital while the transplant was taking place, and the police and cop papers must not shoot at criminals to save their son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). Well, the police in this movie have no brains if they have never heard of a TAZER beating off the criminal without killing him. end of the movie, as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But it all reaches out crazy and stupid, including 2cops death and a few doctors get burned up pretty badly.
