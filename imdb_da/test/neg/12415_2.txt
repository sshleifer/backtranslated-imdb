This film was lacking in many areas. It's about this Elvis type of guy driving cars and being approached by these cyclists from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo and they beat high school children for fun. They want Elvis the guy to be their "driver". At times, I wanted people from the MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually good. Sure there was violence and many cheesy lines, like "What kind of beer would you like? A cold one". It was cheesy. The guy who plays Banjo is a big boxer and I was happy to see him do some fighting scenes. Also the biker named FATS had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket !!! It was pretty bold if I had to say it myself.
