I was expecting this movie to be absolutely god horrible. Like "What Dreams Can Come" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well they sold it for Â£ 3.99 in my local HMV and it had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover you know you can't help but love him and then my friends woke me up to buy it. And I was sure it would be the trash. Perhaps that was the only reason I could sit through this movie because my standards were never so high.
