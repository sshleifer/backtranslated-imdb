This movie was definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The reason could have been done for work if the film was written better. The action was some of the worst I have ever seen. I was very slow and made me leave / turn off the movie several times. I saw the whole movie in the hope that the end would make it worthwhile, but it didn't. This movie, I think, should be evaluated in the negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
