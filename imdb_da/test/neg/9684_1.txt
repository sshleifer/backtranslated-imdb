How offensive! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a Bible. I can imagine they at NBC say, "OK. Let's make a movie to appease the annoying Christians, but they will never know the difference if we have no fact or in the correct chronological order." Now they were wrong. Anyone associated with this cruelty needs to find a church and repent of their commitment to this blasphemous cruelty. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0.
