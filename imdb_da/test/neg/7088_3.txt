This is another of Hollywood's anti-communist polemics in the golden 1950s. Stalwart American Gene Barry, lovely English woman Valerie French, and three others are kidnapped by a stranger and given clamshells containing amazing - and incredibly vague power. What will the landlords do with such power? Throw it into the sea or use it to wipe out all of humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what the commissioners will do, but the story is ripe when the Americans actually test things in the middle of the Pacific. Then a scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! His smart attitude is later nauseating, and the terrible disposition of everyone else is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler for this dog: The capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the Prophet that they only kill "confirmed enemies of freedom"! That's right - don't worry about the ethical concept of killing everyone as a foreign pill determines is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hooray! No dressers! Stupid women - and you threw yours into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me darling!
