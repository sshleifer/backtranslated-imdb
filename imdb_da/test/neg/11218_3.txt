In fact, there are some good reasons why a person should risk going crazy by seeing this show. The breasts are good, although some of them are not so real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Looking at the beach on the screen is also a very relaxing experience as it is an ideal place to just take it easy and not worry too much about being eaten by a rubber shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not god, but a god. It's not so much about his action skills as there is no one, but his chest hair speaks a lot. Also there is no KITT hanging in this series, which is good since Mr Hasselhoff told in an interview that he always thought that KITT was homosexual. It can of course make him look like an idiot, but given the other statements he made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's the kind of show that's totally harmless to humans. It gives us a lot to stare at and much to laugh at, which is something many intentionally humorous shows really do not give us. I must say, it's no wonder that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, it's not a good show, actually it's pretty terrible, but I enjoy watching it. It's pretty much like a B-movie stretched to last for a decade.
