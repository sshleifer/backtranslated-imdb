Interesting concept that just doesn't. I saw the whole movie, but had to read IMDb comments to find out what code 46 meant. If / when it was explained in the movie, I must have been in coma or possibly brain death then. I only saw Tim Robbins. That I didn't know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie shouldn't be it. As for the anti-empathy virus virus-Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where was The Joker, The Riddler, etc? Also, why are the women so damned ugly? If I want to see less than ordinary stick figures, I just walk down the street. The best part of the movie was the car accident. It was completely credible and not over-the-top like most movie crashes.
