I like all different types of movies so it's not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix, etc. I just felt it was a miserable movie. I do not feel that there was enough build up of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a couple of days, and when dealing with a serious hurricane and big problems in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly into love ?? It's not realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally, and that's something you're looking for in a good plot. Some emotional connections. If anyone can relate to them, they fall in love quickly, without any true substance than it is. You are neither right nor wrong. Different lines for different people. Another very incredible component of the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter, who was nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Is a teenage girl who is so miserable and aggravated by her mother not to come back with her cheating man who just needs a contact and turns on? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
