This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie pulls on and off, and I almost knocked it off, but I gave it a shot. I didn't expect anything good, but I expected more than this. Well, I'm working on a video store and saw it for free because I didn't want to use a dime on this movie. I gave this movie a 2, only because I've seen worse. If I were you, I would stay away from this, very far away.
