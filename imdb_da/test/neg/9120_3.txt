I suggest that if you have already seen the original American graffiti, you cannot see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend this, but it will be much less painful to see. The characters from the first movie are great, and eventually you got a connection to them. This movie shows how bad their life has been. It is a task to see! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first movie. In '64, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional skater. He meets an alien girl Eva, and although his plot really doesn't go, it's the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith) stuck in Vietnam and more than anything he wants. He tries to find ways to hurt or do stupid things to get out. In '66 we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl Toad picked up in the first movie. Now she is a forehead that smokes hippie and I'm really not sure what her plot was about. It was her who went to a concert ... not much of anything happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) have had marriage problems ending in an anti-war rally and police action. None of these stories are very good. The writing in some parts has very, very poor dialogue. These bad characters, which I enjoyed so much in the first movie, ended up with where they are ... why? Why was this successor made? I suppose if a successor was made, it had to contain the Vietnam war and hippies and the police, but the real thing is that this movie should not have been made. The direction was stylish, but it's just a big headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just a regular (depending on how you see it) wide screen, and filming how the rest of the movie should be. Toads plot was shot in 16mm and what it corresponds to is a bad-looking image, which is the size of a small box in the center of the screen. Debbie's plot is shot in multi-screen. At some point there could have been a screen, but for the vast majority it is anywhere from two to twenty screens at once. Don't try to follow the screens as nothing happens at all. Steve and Laurie's plot has the weirdest movie style. It's style really doesn't matter and is stupid and meaningless. Instead of just a full widescreen, it's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full-screen widescreen version. Although I do not like the others, I at least understand what they are supposed to do. This one just doesn't make sense. The music is the saving grace of this movie, not that it could save this! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have great songs here. They do not store the function, they just do a little better than it is. It's still bad! <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a meaningless sequel. Any fan of the original must avoid this noisy sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 110 min. PG for language, drug use and violence
