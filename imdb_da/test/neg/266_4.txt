I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite fun, helped by performances and direction. However, I was disappointed with this movie. Don't make me wrong, it's not a complete dud, thanks to the amazing performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon in particular and the effective direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really suffers from lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow, I almost fell asleep between a string of keys. Secondly, the plot is very similar and there are many terms that make it difficult to quit. The camera work was not as new as it was in the first movie either. In the first movie it was smooth and professional, it was shaken and awkward here, and the music was not very memorable. The play was not so twisted or fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day, it felt too lazy despite the expert's play and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
