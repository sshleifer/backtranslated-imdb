Many years ago, Sara, a young girl, saw that her parents were murdered, now as adults she suffers from various mental disorders (I said she has an imaginary friend?) This film lures the viewer, not in a sense of excitement, Imagine, but rather a sense of sleepiness. Dead boring, I found it hard to sit through as I could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each infinite minute of thoughtless and assumed "mystery".

Skip this movie, save yourself time better suited to doing other more valuable tasks. <br /> <br /> My character: D-
