If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not so talented actors, this movie would probably be even worse than it really is. The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting and well worth exploring. On the negative side, the plot is increasingly over the top as the story progresses, and the music choices are becoming increasingly bizarre, so at the end I myself was laughing when I knew the director intended to cry.
