I must admit I chose this movie just for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow - as usual - were great performing artists, the rest of the movie was such a disappointment. It feels like it was composed of a team of low-level scripts, ie scripts lacking in depth, horrible photography and editing and hilariously miserable score! I can't believe I was able to see this seemingly long movie at the end ... the sad thing is, it could actually have been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a hit; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a large core cast (although many other actors are quite so much a soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it's still no more worth than a 3 in my opinion.
