This miniseries / movie was so awful at times that I almost broke down and knocked it off. I'm a big fan of the novel, but this movie suffers from many problems. Costuming is poor and many of the more emotional scenes are blasphemous. The deviations from the novel are poorly selected, important nuances are missed or rewritten. <br /> <br />
