It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay in, have a good dinner and watch this movie on TCM instead of going out. We are in our 40s and 50s, love romance and are both "softies", but this movie just bombarded us (it's hard to imagine it was nominated for Oscars, etc., but I think it was as). The cinematography was beautiful, but for the most part the movie as a whole is terribly dated. Jennifer Jones' character created so many references to her as Eurasion that we started counting and after a while we giggled every time she said it. In addition, the "theme song" played incessantly throughout the film, and we couldn't wait for it to pass so we could see the evening news.
