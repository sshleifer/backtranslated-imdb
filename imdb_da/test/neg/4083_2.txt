Oh, Mr Carell! How far have you fallen! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's choice of film begins to contrast strongly with what has come since. Although 40-year-old virgin was entertaining, it became dwarfed by his "sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that would make me pop up my nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might be waiting for me here. Not much ... As the trite and clich√©d script felt the whole movie forced and unemotional. Poking some fun on fluttering family values, and the current US administration takes the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a deeply biblical moment in humorous terms, but doesn't fail. <br /> <br /> Almost all people on Earth know the story of Noah and The Ark. The wrath of God was sent down by 30 days and nights of rain that flooded the whole planet, while Noah, his family, and two of each of his creatures on the earth rescued the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wooden sheet. It was a tremendous moment in human history (if you believe in the biblical text). <br /> <br /> So why would God come to a man and ask him to build a sheet that would only carry the animals of the world for a few minutes after a dam? The simple answer is that he would never. Too much emphasis was placed on US government policy and not enough on world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and American film. Although it is designed as a comedy, when it never laughs at anything approaching the stomach. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but a little different. John Goodman (CARS) draws on another compulsory performance as the despicable congressman Chuck Long, whose sole purpose is to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 POINTS OF LESS), like God, cannot help dripping this bleeding wet disaster-of-a-movie. <br /> <br /> The only fun moments are between Carell and the animals, especially as Evan learns what animal magnetism really is. Birds are literally flocking to him. Sheep herd around him. Lions are proud to be close to him (please forgive the proverbs). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun to watch, but were short (for good reason). The "flood" was interesting because the ark was obviously ruled by his hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But apart from being in a little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
