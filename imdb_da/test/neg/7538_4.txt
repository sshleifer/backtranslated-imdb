After seeing PUREL BELTER, I came to this site to review it, but not only that I also had to check the resume of writer / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared on the opening point, I knew I had seen his name before somewhere, and after I found out, he wrote and directed the movie version of LITTLE VOICE one of the most underrated feel good British movies from the 1990s <br /> <br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different boiler fish. It's a nasty stereotypical view of Geordie's life and a very unfunny one in it. Everyone is either a wife, a single mother, a shoplift, a full or a junkie. Since many scenes are set in a school, the PE teacher is a sadistic bully and that is the closest thing the movie ever comes to reality. Oh, and everyone is very creepy mouth that adds to the wicked unlikely atmosphere. I didn't like PURELY BELTS much while I was watching and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like it even less. With a little voice Herman showed that you can make an entertaining uplifting comedy with northern souls, but I had to ask where his undoubted talent went into this movie?
