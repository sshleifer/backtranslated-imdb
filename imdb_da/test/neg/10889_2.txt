This movie is not a horror movie. There is nothing scary about it It's more of a torture girl. And it makes no sense to me that there are few scenes with disappearing organs. At the moment he is a woman at the beginning of the film. What is pulled away returns to a scene in the toilet with Nicole and she and she disappear completely. Then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears. He had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him. I don't think so specially when you can see his head half-blown and not kill him? At the end she sets the killer's truck on fire. That, but he's not in it. He's behind her. Then it is cut until the rest Stop has been completely remodeled, and some people are in the remnant area, and a new girl comes in and Nicole asks for help as the first girl, without meaning in this movie. Save yourself some money and skip this movie.
