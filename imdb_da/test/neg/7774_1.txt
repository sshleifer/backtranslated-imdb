I don't know if I should be entertained or offended by killing like this pronounced by "Lifetime: TV for Women" Must be renamed "Lifetime: TV to Shut In Drama Queens" because I haven't seen a movie yet var It is a tear that raises boiler boiler. This movie was no exception. You know that a movie is going to be bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling, quite a creation of poor plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. Everyone else matched her in incredibly bad acting and the story was past stupid as if anyone could believe in any of it. If I had not been helpless on the couch, fell down with the same fascination, then you see a good car wreck, I would have changed the channel.
