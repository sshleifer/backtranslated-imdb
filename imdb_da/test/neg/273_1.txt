I have seen "professional" reviews claiming that Julia Roberts player himself was "clever and very funny". I do not think. An actress plays herself? And does it with her same usual dizziness when trying out comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at the extreme. Why is she not just standing there and going, "me, me, me. Look at me!" The director and author must be shot not to think of anything better than this in what might have been a charming sequel. And by the way, Steven, when the audience begins to put more emphasis on the weird camera angles, then history has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras, but they were good enough not to lose the audience or just show up with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule for film making in the name of "style". Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good, but perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with narcissism, it could have worked. Zeta Jones again shows how she has more talent and beauty when Roberts could dream. Unfortunately, this movie is deleted and failed on many accounts. I want my money back.
