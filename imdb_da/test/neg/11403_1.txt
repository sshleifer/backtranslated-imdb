Yesterday was one of the days we decided to go to the cinema. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less randomly, but we were interested in seeing the current Dutch film creation. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a book by Ronald Giphart and I must admit immediately that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film has actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their appearance in soap operations and / or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some pretty decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give this film the benefits of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake it was. This movie fails on all fronts. Bad acting (the best performance is actually by a guinea pig who very convincingly pretends to be dead). Flat, uninteresting story with inexplicable and uninteresting sidelines (Why France? Why tell the story to a girl from Uganda?) Errors (black people do not need sunscreen as far as I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands do not produce clouds of steam as in New York Although it looks good on movies, people do not wear T-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There is a fun moment involving two little dogs, and that's it. So that's what I think, but more importantly, none of the people who left the cinema afterwards had it. I overheard one of them saying he was very disappointed because he liked the book so much. I didn't read the book, but my advice had to be: read the book, not see the movie.
