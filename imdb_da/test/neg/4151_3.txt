My wife and I never got into the movie. We thought it was a way to beatooowwww and to many subtitles. I understood they needed them for Vietnam, but took too long to get out of Asia. She wanted it, I said it would get better. It never did, they had a hard time trying to get to America, but I wanted to see him see and find his father. Not at the end, but forming a relationship. When I mention that it was slllloooowww. I love watching a movie to feel good not sad at the end. I know they don't make many good movies now days. I think action movies are the only ones to watch. I have rented a lot from netflix and now blockbuster, maybe 20% is worth seeing.I did not kneel realism or facts, just a movie that is fun and makes you feel good.Gary
