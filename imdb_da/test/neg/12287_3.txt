It can be all you need to know to determine if you want to see this. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems to be aware of it and make fun how bad it is. It adjusts the cliche for clich√© and even manages to get worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be fun fun. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh at really poor quality in manuscripts and production values, you like it. Otherwise, prepare for some serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
