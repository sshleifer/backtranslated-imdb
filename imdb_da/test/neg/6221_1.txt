I love musicals, all from happy Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic "Damn Yankees." And I know most songs, sometimes they sang spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone. In a "real" musical, differentiated from this vaudeville show, each song is carefully crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sorrow, regret, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words fail. So in Guys and Dolls, "My Time of Day" describes Sky Masterson's adventurous life as it is being compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant copy of the genre sets the mood, or develops a character that creates a phantasmagoria, and becomes completely credible by the self revealing the song's statement. <br /> <br /> For this lover of Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the latter half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There the songs in these musicals performed the often elaborate, often lovely, plot lines. While here, the songs are simply picked up from a collection, only disturbed the film's appalling premise. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the viewers who make this movie a monumental success are simply not exposed to the art form of 20th century musicals. They have no clue about the magic done by writer and copywriter who can transform a dance hall into someone we know and love, as achieved in "Sweet Charity." <br /> <br /> Let me offer excuse for the arrogance of this review. Maybe, another day, another mood I could have gotten and haven't been so critical of this review. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others might have done with this stupid premise. I'm thinking about that while the memories of watching this movie are fresh and I can't help but make the big loss.
