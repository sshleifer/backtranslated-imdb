This comment is mainly intended as a warning to those people who can be attracted to the title by its (temporarily) high user rating, which I find frankly obscure. The reasons why I did not like this title are: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have doubted whether to make a Jackie-Chan type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, the film falls in the form of a genre between two stools, as the tragic and cartoon elements collide and cancel each other instead of creating a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and convincing. Unfortunately, psychological truth and logic are missing. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd molding. I do not blame the actors because it is difficult to create a compelling character by acting alone if there is scarce logic in the script. Why is there, however, an apparent age difference of approx. 15 years between the two leading players whose age in the film can not differ more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was bad entertainment primarily due to point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with, it's hard to follow the story of interest. When you finally learn the reason for what happened to the protagonist, it does not seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. After watching this movie, I began to wonder if the thinking that the director was trying to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be wholesome and lovely. I can't put any other construction at the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie is abundant with completely unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing if it serves an important and dignified purpose. The purposes may be different and I do not want to be part of this broad subject. Let me just say that I am not protesting against violence in such films as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Passion of Christ" or "The Pulp Fiction". In "Oldboy" torture and the scenes of suffering are extended and graphic (or responsive). Why? I do not know. Personally, I do not derive any satisfaction from seeing teeth extracted with a hammer or hearing a man cutting off the tongue with a pair of scissors and then seeing him suffocate on his own blood etc. Etc. 7. The film reminds me of a bit of Japanese porn manga in its fixation on incest and young Asian girls panties, urination and the like. It seems that there is a minority who actually enjoys this kind of thing. If you are one of them, you can find this movie enjoyable. <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it's not stupid, it's disgusting. Do not waste your time.
