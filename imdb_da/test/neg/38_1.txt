I only came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternative title, so I wanted to know what I shouldn't pick up. Not only do I get the original title but I'm going to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliases. This is a real clunker. Films like this can usually be forgiven for a number of reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the function at each production level, resulting in at least a mild form of entertainment, mainly entertainment. This has none of it. Instead, the viewer witnesses excessively unnecessary and overly practical-for-situations exhibits and drawn-out scenes of characters ranging from space to space, and all of this is half the film. Forget trying to find out where someone is (or who they are) during dark or night scenes too; You probably won't worry, anyway. There is also a random car chase sequence that seems rather boring compared to some of the old driver's ed movies I drag ... I think I got through and looked far back at high school. Really, we're talking about mystery, possession and a killer on it loose - not a bad recipe for the trash. Unfortunately there is nothing here to make it even "good" garbage can; When they go along with the above, the bad actors and non-special effects are just as bad actors and not-so-special effects. This is just a rubbish bin, clean and simple. Leave it on the stand at the farm shop or in the box at the yard. There is a reason there ...
