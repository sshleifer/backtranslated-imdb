But it is not. The reason is not so bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it must be decent. Instead of a good starting point, the plot just goes on and suffers from many of them "I can't believe he / she is so stupid" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It frustrated me sometimes to see some of the main character's decision. It also took far too long to get to the good part of the movie. Expectations are good, but you can't spend more than half of the film build. A shame too, as it got decent exposure upon release and hit just before the big Halloween season. Still, I have a feeling that this is going to get at least one successor, if not more, so maybe they will be able to build on the strong general plot to ultimately release something decent.
