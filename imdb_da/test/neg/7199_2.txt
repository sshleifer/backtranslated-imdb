This is the first movie I've seen from Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem. The above title was superfluously added later since another similar title exists in 1961 with Richard Basehart, which was Hammer Films 'Michael Carreras' only and only Western one; The real Italian title was originally translated as his name was SAM WALBASH, but they called him AMEN ?? although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian variant, which of course involves a tribute of kind to Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> Although not at all unlikely to be bad, occurrences of clumsiness and tenacity occur so that I often break up in laughter's screams: a horrible figure of an indisputable French chanteuse; a completely irrelevant barbarian actors do somersaults when they are shot an old villager making an impromptu dance routine; inefficient use (actual abuse) of slow motion; and light the most distinguished when Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two pistol fighters (sports actors' own names!) hired by the villain to kill the title character and then never make them appear in the rest of the movie! ! <br /> <br /> Heading actor Robert Woods is just that down to ineffective whispering Amens over his victims. Entertaining actress Simonella Vitelli (actually the director's own daughter!) As the villain is wide is a look, but unfortunately she doesn't get much in the movie ?? despite a change of heart towards the end. The most important musical theme is actually quite good, but again the title song itself is completely miserable.
