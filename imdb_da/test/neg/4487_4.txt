I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors in "Dear John", but it was very slow to move; And I felt that both the manuscript and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principal artists. I usually enjoy movie adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did an excellent job of portraying realistic military action. <br /> <br /> The kinematics were very good at signing through love letters and focused just enough on a keyword or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum was knocked down in what became a very "hanging dog" series of expressions in response to losses.
