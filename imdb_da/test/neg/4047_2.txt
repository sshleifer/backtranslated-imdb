This has to be one of the weakest plots in a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But that's not all this movie is missing. This movie has the worst deals, writes, controls, special effects you name it - it's the worst ever. I highly recommend spending your time on valuable movies and not wasting your time on this treasure. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous post that "the women" were definitely men dressed in a row and that made me laugh I was trying to find out if they were obvious about it or if they actually tried to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is not much else in this movie worth seeing! <br /> <br /> To sum it up: terribly acting, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. Half an hour in my life, I want to go back right now!
