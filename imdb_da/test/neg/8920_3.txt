Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing other drug dealers and giving the poor and unlucky. Hi, Harlan, Robin Hood. Still, Harlan wants to go straight to his girl, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he assumes a job as the driver of a hooded car for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted in a subordinate role). Max intends to get millions for himself and his conscientious employees for the purpose of using his loader Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. Escaping police, hiding the money and ditches Bruno (who had a loaded gun pointed at Harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive) after failing to catch by hitting a huge dump truck, Harlan's passing out. Charged with the murder of the police, among other things because of the damage caused by the high-speed time, Harlan is imprisoned and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins an inmate, Is (Treach), leader of one of the many gangs in the prison, breaking out with plans to find Max and eliminating any member of his corrupt affiliation. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) will be part of this scenario thanks to his boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims there are drugs involved. Also injected into the plot is Harlan's desire to save a children's hospital to close, and Jada has mysterious dreams of Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach beat each other in gangsta, while Buxton spends time trying to help Harlan, revealing the possibility that her boss is in cahoots with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck that gives Rachel a lot of space despite the threat she is in her career. Tighe shows up for five or so minutes peaks, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes prison and finds every rich associate of Max's, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after cracking a few skulls, snapping some wrists and breaking some bones. Treach speaks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to answer him in the wild and gives some unintentional laughs. As you would expect, many people are shot and Seagal does not break a sweat. It is interesting to see Seagal in prison among the judges who help Treach out when a group of "Eses" plans to take him out.
