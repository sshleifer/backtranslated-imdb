Plants in an old Mayan pyramid structure kill everyone who comes close. Yes, it's weird, as the travelers don't expect it until everything starts to get crazy. And in a movie like this I just wanted it to go absurd and had marched bands that were attacked by plants that turned machetes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from America vacation and go into the mountains with a few other newly created German friends who know about the place. When they get there, the Mayans started shouting at them and hiding on the structure. And when, when the plants decide to take them out, the mobile's sounds, people and ancient Maya mimic dead people. Nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining. Not even the strange end could save this piece of shit. I continued to look for something really good to do, but nothing. Oh good. "F"
