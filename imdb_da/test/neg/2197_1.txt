We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary and those who don't. Those who understand binary put this movie in their grave with hackers, while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake of nothing of this crap. Ever. <br /> <br /> For a movie trying to be a modern film with fiction applied to it. It has failed. Horribly. Only a 11 year old and under can enjoy and only 30 years and over could be afraid to have their identity taken. It loses out on the main market for a resale value (I see it now is more boring than when it was first released).
