I thought this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was more like something someone in high school would do with their parents' video camera. It was not just the low budget that made this movie bad (many fantastic movies are made on a low budget), it's simply a bad movie, and it wasn't even bad enough to be a good camp. Cases in point: In the first ten minutes of the movie, nothing happens unless the 3 main characters sit in their room, smoke dope, put on their makeup and then answer a phone call. You wait for something to get the story moving, but it never comes. The sound was so bad I had to turn the TV up completely to get almost what they said (which wasn't interesting anyway). If I was paying to rent a movie, I would usually suffer through it even when it was bad, but that was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems that the person for me felt the same because they did not rewind the tape and let go of the same place I did. The only reason I gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system does not have negative numbers.
