It was (foolish) with a degree of joy that I sat down to see what a friend had promised would be the worst / best movie experience of my life, the mighty 'roller blade 7'. 2 years on and I'm still in therapy. Oh yeah, my dear friends, it's really that bad. Of course, they were given approximately 40 minutes of shots in the can and then decided to use the said recording infinitely and repeatedly for brain-numbering effect. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world seen in this turkey is that somehow a print of this abomination would survive. The living would really envy the dead.
