Before I really turn this movie off, I just want to say that I absolutely loved it. <br /> <br /> First, how many times in the movie did the characters use the phrase "You're Right." I'm sure I counted on the hundreds before I gave up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Second, what the hell is that with the blue monkey stuff? OK, so the Dancing family was looking for a lot of privacy and had a brown eye on a blue eye, but since then is it about people for underground carnivorous blue zombie creatures? And finally, "old faithful here will protect me" hahaha :)
