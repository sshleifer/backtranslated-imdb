Tagline: The lucky dead ... before you saw this. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Bulgarian 1920's movie, so I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I almost can't remember it. All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do nothing right. Their car has a wheel out of four fixed in the sand, so they decide there is nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a cannibal band in the residence, but has never considered the idea of ​​reporting to the police. <br /> <br /> And talking about the police ... if those freaks have lived in there and eat people for years, many people must be gone ... how has the sheriff not lost anything? <br /> <br /> But I stopped asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is drilling. A hallucinated incredible bore. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about the dialogues. And the actor. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention the final scene where the freak girl removes a snake (the snakes! They eventually come out, what the hell are they doing with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw of a stone showing full respect for Mr. Craven for reality and for things happening on planet Earth in general. I think there have been troubles when the movie was first released in 1977. Even though they are eaten by a cannibal, it would not be a fair punishment for the director of this intelligence attack.
