The AALCC informs us that 14-year-olds can be quite obnoxious and evil. For those who do not know, the film performs a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I want to allow the camera work to be sometimes striking, but also to be crazy self-righteous at other times. The actors record screen space and screen time, but do not count as convincing people. I suppose the email that flashes across the screen means you have to find out which character has which moniker, but I simply couldn't tell enough differences to do it, and It didn't really matter.
