Apart from the gunfight scene, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played these roles in their sleep. The dialogue was marginally acceptable (and there was plenty of it - no one sat quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes were to slam into the story, there was no subtlety at all - shadows hit you between the eyes and they led you through the nose through most of the story (I think they added all the dialog box to make sure you didn't miss anything) and the editing really needed to tighten up (each actor's screen time was more than quality - again, too much dialogue). The whole story took place in a few days, but everything that happened took epic proportions, just like how Daily events seemed great to you in high school, but in the big scheme it wasn't that important. Yeah, the bad broke up and killed Moses, they beat up Button, they killed the dog - everything that would get Boss and Charley's blood up. But the importance was diluted by all the "deep, meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the movie. These guys worked together for 10 years and they are talking about these things right now? The only time there was not much dialogue was in the war situation - which is probably why I liked it. Finally, someone else gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! The pointed hair strands around her face that were (I suppose) to make her look a little more romantic made her a little confused. If she worked outside the home, it would have made more sense. Plus, why wasn't she already married? There seemed to be more "friendly and gentle" (her words) single men in the city except for marshal and his cronies. In fact, none of the evil seemed to have her either (a common plot unit in other movies). She remained most vigilant in the house and apparently did not work much with the people of the city. Do you wonder ...... <br /> In all, the movie was too long, too chatty and too confused for me. It felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me, despite all the dialogues.
