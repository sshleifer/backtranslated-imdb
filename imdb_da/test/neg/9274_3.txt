The movie has a good story line, the action is good in some parts, but not all of them. Some of the parts, I just felt, that the evil guys wouldn't have dosed off yet, from my experience of martial arts. Some are the actions are long as always for the boss, but for the least important they were killed or rejected with a few hits, but some were rather unrealistic or could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The least important actors or stunt people were the right choice for the movie, my boyfriend began to fall in love with them, she began to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, that's all I can say.
