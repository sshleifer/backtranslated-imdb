I read the latest comments and couldn't wait to see the movie. But after sitting for 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that didn't even make me jump and unrealistic villain, I was very disappointed. I thought the cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long. I thought this could be because of the edits to make it R, but the original contained only ten minutes of "Kill Bill" -type blood. When blood spreads like snakes, reality loses appeal. Add to the killer who must be a "ghost" but can tear others' heads away from the jaw (ala King Kong with T-Rex), live through everything and have an end that resembles that of the soprano finale and you certainly has the most overheated movie in the last year. After watching the movie, I felt that I had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt largely dissatisfied. I dunno what everyone else saw in it, but if you want a good horror movie over the weekend, watch Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to the Hatchet, let's hope the next one is based on the book.
