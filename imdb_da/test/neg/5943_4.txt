"Midnight Clear" has a good premise. A group of over-educated, overly bright GIs are emitted by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol an isolated farmhouse on the thresholds of the thresholds. The GIs encounter a group of fighting German regulars, and it becomes clear that they will not fight anymore. <br /> <br /> Here is the problem. It's really pretty simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do it, and that is the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that is also the end of the movie. So, instead of doing either the GIs and the Germans playing games with each other, you must even throw snowballs at some point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but it quickly becomes very annoying. After all, these are GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this movie makes me believe that they should not be captured or shot either. The film notes to make them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters did ME will shoot them, including a scene where the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a more devoted man! Why should I worry about such signs? Just shoot them and let's move on to the battle. It's much more interesting, anyway. A good scene: The GIs return from a reconstruction of the German position, where they had the Germans in their sights, but not burned. As they cross a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans have their Mausers leveled on them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The GIs do something I have never seen any GIs do in any Sillywood movie. They throw their rifles and throw their hands up! Unusual, as this may be in movies, it is a perfectly sensible response to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. Although it seems to be long, these rifles are really shiny. I would add that someone working on this movie was a cruffler!
