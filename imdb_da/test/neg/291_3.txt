I heard the stories of ravers in the movie and that's good, but it's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is cheesiness. I never really got the plot or why the guy stole girls. It makes no sense, but hey ... why they were in a club by chance was curious too. Many parts of this movie make no sense, but in general I was interested. It was confusing at many levels ... maybe I'm just not indie enough for this movie, but judging from the B-look scene, they ran out of money, just cut some things in and forgot the plot. Its low budget and appears as such. I like that they used small special effects that were bad, but they used none there was quality. I would say that this movie is the quintessential bad script, with alright production. It's certainly not as random as many movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effect, I would give exception to the final battle, since all the effects went on the 1950s on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like. Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. Mystery science theater has a candidate.
