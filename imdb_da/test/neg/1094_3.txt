With Hong Kong's heartbeat Andy Lau and the veteran star Ching Wan Lau, "Aau Chin" have everything to go to it at the start of the movie, unfortunately the movie is at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished ... He draws a deeper scheme that deludes the police into helping him ... But The police are hot on the tail .... Can he pull it off before it gets caught? <br /> <br /> The construction of the film is good. Bits of pieces of track are left for the audience to try to guess the right intention. Unfortunately, the construction leads to a disappointed final showdown. It feels as if in the middle of the script the author has been changed and that the whole building is interrupted. <br /> <br /> A 3/10 ....
