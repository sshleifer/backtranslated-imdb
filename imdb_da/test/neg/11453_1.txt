The selection of the inflated, boring and racist "Cimarron" ranks as the worst choice for the best picture in Oscar's history. Poorly acted (especially by the righteously forgotten Richard Dix, whose performance as the self-centered and irresponsible Yancey Cravat is one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history) and leadenly paced, the film is really shocking today because of the racist slope against one black character introduced by being displayed sleeps in a chandelier. Other comments from IMDb reviewers have rejected the attitude to this character as simply dated, but many films that appeared during this period did NOT portray blacks as mixed, lazy mental deficiencies in the way that this behemoth has great pleasure in; so this argument seems weak to say the least. But whether you see this dull character as in shockingly bad taste to anyone at any time or just the forgiving ignorance of a less educated era, it is very painful to see with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even that may not be the case if the movie was not the oblong bore it is. Aligned the Best Picture Oscar at the 1930/31 Academy Awards, as such enduring classics like "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" were not nominated, "Cimarron" is by far the worst choice for participating in the Oscar Pantheon.
