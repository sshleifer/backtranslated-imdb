I can't give it less than a star I tried. At the moment I'm not sure if I'm halfway through or not, but I actively paused to notice the time when part of it was revealed to be a dream. Or not. Or maybe it was. I think viewers who wrote a comment that did not include the descriptions "horrible" or "horrible" or "made me swallow a bullet" are probably enough to be because it is an indie film. Don't listen to them, listen to me - there's no nudity in the movie, skip it. I needed ten lines to submit this warning, so I would also say that the goth girl some users have described as "hot" is bold. She has fat elephant legs.
