Writer / Director Michael Hurst's Sci-Fi Channel sequel to Stan Winston's classic horror story of revenge has gone wrong, has moments and something decent to do, but eventually falls in comparison to the original. I'm pretty sure the filmmakers didn't try to make a comedy, but I made myself laugh all the way through. A family celebration started over a car accident is the basis for this access to the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a backwoods town with dirt roads, pickup trucks, drinking moonshine, and kicking each other's asses every chance they get. Just as they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love and cause them to beat the shan. One evening, the two love birds decide to go out into the woods for some quality time, while Ricky's sister plays looking, but it just happens that some of Hatfield's accidentally hit Ricky's sister and catch him and Jodie together. You know what happens next time. Ricky finds his sister's body and decides to visit Haggis so he can settle for his revenge through the mighty Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! Also, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential damned souls of using Pumpkinhead to ease their pain. That really puts a kink in history because Harley should have called Pumpkinhead years before this story takes place, but the setting and the characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled through time to bring the truck back to Plymouth. Then there is the Sheriff (Rob Freeman), who has his own ties to the demon and seems to be in a 70's revenge movie instead of a tailor-made flip. Special effects were cool, but instead of sticking to the way of thinking, Hurst used some horrible 3D images for specific scenes. A particularly embarrassing shot shows Pumpkinhead jumping from the tree branches as a poorly reproduced 3D monkey. The kinematics were unusual and slightly increased the quality of the film. The action was also quite decent also, with the exception of a few poorly executed accents. Family heirs never end well, especially when the families involved in the feud have to deal with Pumpkinhead. I didn't enjoy every minute of this flick, but it was much better than most of the movies Sci-Fi Channel spits out. Perhaps it is a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its films up to match the quality of the original series'. I wouldn't waste any coin on a rental, but if you get the chance to get a recovery from it on boob tubes, I'd say check it out. It's a not-so-killer movie, but it rises slightly above the level of waste that makes it a DVD these days.
