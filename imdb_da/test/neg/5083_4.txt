This is the price that made me lose all respects to Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such a "prominent" panel can't see or care about Battlestar Galactica's obvious storytelling problems, then what is the host's award? The answer: not much. Award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and expertise, none of which are evidence of BG, of this episode or of others I have seen. <Br /> <br /> Shooting in killing video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative", it is vomiting and lazy as possible. <br /> <br /> All BGs have shown how corrupt most award-winning "academies" really are and how easy it is to buy many PR cash prizes.
