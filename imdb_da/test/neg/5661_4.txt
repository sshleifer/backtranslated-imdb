The first time I saw this show it was ok. There were some fun moments and I laughed a few times, but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is not least fun. They play a silly video from the internet, scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. And then laugh the track off?! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. Carly is not fun. Miranda Cosgrove's performance is insufficient at best. Her performance in this show is nothing like her act from Drake and Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and raw and the show is written in a way that makes her look like a kind of hillbilly. I think they make jokes that the mother is running a rusty old truck, her mother is smashing an old TV with a bat, and then there are jokes that Sam is not going to school, being imprisoned all the time and running from the police. None of that is fun. Then Freddy is a computer geek. He's not too funny unless his mother treats him like a baby. The show's only slightly fun full-time character is Carly's brother Spencer. He does some fun jokes and does some fun fun things like pretending to drive a spaceship while they are doing spacecraft sound, and knocking over a girl's scolding table for revenge when they did the same for him. His material is the only thing worth laughing at. Apart from the characters, other things also do the show. Like the fact that a couple of children make a local web show from a Seattle apartment, is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is how can a 26-year-old single guy without real jobs pay for a 2-level apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and audio equipment, including a remote-controlled projector and a green screen and an HD camera? It sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. The worst thing is that the show contains some rather dubious content. There are a few times when Carly (remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "just slept his socks the night before." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode where Carly's rival Nevel challenges her by taking her website rights and agreeing to return her site in exchange for a kiss. Spooky! And I just saw an episode where Carly met a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injuries and he takes off his shirt and Carly stands there throwing himself over him. I can't believe Nick even lets them show that these kind of bad things and I can't believe this was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under the age of 12 and it is even doubtful. iCarly is just an extra addition to the long list of horrible Nick programming.
