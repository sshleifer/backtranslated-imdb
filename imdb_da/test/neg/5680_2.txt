Nothing to ruin here at all, but this could be a SPOILER so beware. <br /> <br /> Special effects were on par with a video game - about five years ago, or perhaps by the original Star Trek. The action was just pathetic - some cheesy looking blonde treking over the desert while a voice in the background droned on. And on. And on. This was the trek and drone half as I actually did it through. Progress is interrupted by a few matches. Ships blow each other up for no real reason, apparently episodic. Again, it is not that there is a real fight as you would expect from a movie, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship. Apparently, some of the ships are looking for the blonde. Here in the long term, ships must be near-sighted and astigmatic, because many of them pass directly overhead of the stylishly dressed futuristic child in black, but never see her. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of choreographed battles that look like something of high school kids. Again, the raw video game mentality is prominent. The fighters switch to "Battle mode" by turning something on their wrists, and a high computer controlled voice echo and flashing "Battle Mode". It must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak up on someone. Then go to a large power plant that looks like a power supply tower today and turns on to charge. LOL, I'm not fun, you can't do these things, it's like watching a freaking video game from around 2000, only the play is better in the game. More trekking. Then she shows up at "The City". (Lame sound trek just gets lame here.) She enters a fight with the future of the mech robot, who can't beat her with his big gun, even though she runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Of course, robots in the distant future are as useful as toaster ovens in a fight. She throws sand in her eyes and beats it to death by throwing stones at it. rofl, I was about 95% of the tolerance at the time my nausea was flashing red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, she immediately ends a rocket with some rope. I'm not asking you, tied right outside a rocket. This must be an advanced form of transport. At that time I bailed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lovely disgrace to a movie made at this time. Just a freaking disgrace. There was a drippy story, but the movie distracted from it - some droning about "mother" all the time. <br /> <br /> I gave it a two because there were a few scenes that showed some beautiful images of a science fiction nature as a background. Unfortunately, plot, action, action, filmography and narrative derived from this artwork and break it down. You do not say.
