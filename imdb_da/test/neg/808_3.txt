As a South African resident in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I'm sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment. The three biggest problems I had with the movie were a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - playing the leaders. This country is bursting with talent and no need for imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has been acting on its campaigns for several years. She is a very mediocre writer, and even her novel does not stand up for Mr Hooper's flaccid ... and c) Hilary Swank again, such a great actor, as shown in the Million Dollar Baby (but it's also Eastwood), dressed here in the modern New York style, while roaming freely around the Karoo's poverty. Where was the consideration and sensitivity the customer and the director needed? Yes, the movie is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - But the overall mood at the end is one of the huge letdown. Heart is in the right place but needs a pace maker.
