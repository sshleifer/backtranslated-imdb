I have to say when I watched this movie on a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was worth seeing. I was very disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is obvious that the two suspected FBI agents are actually the killings. Could they have made it more obvious? If it's the intended "twist" in this movie, it's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, their talent doesn't mean a reprehensible bad script. Pullman skillfully acts that part of a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There is no switch from "I play the FBI guy!" to "I just killed 12 people and boy, my arms are tired." You can't blame the actors ... the story fails in much more ways than one. <br /> <br /> From the start of the movie, however, I was sure I had something wrong that no director / writer would ever be so overtly obvious about a plot "twist". Ormond and Pullman just have to act oddly to divert the viewers' attention from the right killers, I thought ... which gave the film's decision makers too much credit. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15 minute mark. <br /> <br /> For Lynch's credit she managed to mix many things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-educated actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. Hopefully, Pell James can get out of this role ... I found her performance extremely impressive when the amazing addict turned. She should have rewritten the role so "crack whore" would win. The people who compared this movie to Natural Born Killers, note: Tarantino made the characters Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, but sympathetic. The art film's artistry overrides gore, and it is not even seen in Monitoring. Surveillance only wants it to be Natural Born Killers ... actually it has wet dreams of being just a fraction of what that movie was. People who haven't seen Surveillance ... stick to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
