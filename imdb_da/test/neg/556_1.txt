Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this uninteresting film movie. Pat Morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to render her role as the "Karate teacher" and bring her karate mark back to the silver screen again, except this time, Hillary "shank" Swank the student. <br /> <br /> I can only see the Hollywood authors being excited about the idea of ​​having a "troubled, spoiled" abrupt woman who takes the role of Ralph. The movie does not work at any level and it is boring at all levels. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold onto. The film was made without thinking about making money because it is just so bad. <br /> <br /> I wanted to spit on all the actors in this movie for being involved in it and blacklisting the authors for their miserable and abusive efforts.
