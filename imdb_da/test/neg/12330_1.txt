There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. Let me first start by saying that I think Grinch was an undervalued and unworthy movie. Kat was ... yes, just awful. Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and terribly commits himself to the supreme scandalous signs. Mike Myers dropped back on his old bag of tricks. Why Why Mike Myers? The kids could break less and the demographic Austin Powers won't spy on this movie. So what then did the study teeth? The cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? Not entirely in line with anything, Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the instructor and studio tried to edit before just giving in and saying "as long as you don't say fah", you can keep the accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any kind of comfort, either with costume, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The whims of being there were raw and aging inappropriate. When Myers picks up a garden garden and delivers to the camera: "dirty ho" lacked anything but the wheelbarrow, and even that would not have helped. "cat." The seats and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was something fun to be with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. was the only actor who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and remained faithful to the genre, call SPCA, this cat should be neutralized and never reproduced again. no continuation.
