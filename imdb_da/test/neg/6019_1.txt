Why does poster and artwork say "Clubbed is one of the best British movie films I've seen for a very long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL", as it was a quote from the French distributor, REPORTED by Screen International (an influential film trade publication). See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 which reads: "Pretty Pictures has acquired all French-speaking rights to Neil Thompson's Clubbed .... James Velaise, President of Beautiful Pictures, said:" Clubbed is one of the best british indie movies I've seen for a very long time. "" <br /> <br /> Isn't this misleading? The distributor is obliged to say that it is good. Are the other quotes right?
