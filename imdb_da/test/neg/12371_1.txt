This is one of the most ridiculously bad movies I've ever seen. I can't believe who wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was associated with doing so. It has nothing to do with it. There is no excitement, the play is fierce, the direction hopeless. Music score (?) Are three trite notes game ad nauseam. The reason (?) Should have taken every five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would bring if he was asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redeeming feature is the actor who plays psycho himself, as grimaces, shakes and gurns splendidly and is thus entertaining at times. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you suffer from a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
