Not even 'less' Hitch, but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: imaginative script, static point of view, spoiled clothes, terrible hair, unlikely actors and a really free rape and strangulation scene. The director's perverse sense of humor is present, but it is not used consistently; The movie only comes alive in its cruelty. The women go particularly badly; 'Frenzy' could be used as proof that the instructor was a misogynist, although a better explanation for me is that it may begin with his television series and 'Psycho' - as he himself described as an exercise in thrift, an attempt for to see if a television crew could shoot an acceptable function - Fredfred Hitchcock had virtually left art and settled for trade. In 'Frenzy', the great master seems to bow to the convention, try to go with time and give the audience what he thinks they want - in the form of unpleasant nudity, nudge nudge blink and general nastiness. I do not desire an old man his rest, but I will not remember him tired and lazy and pandering - time to see 'Vertigo' again!
