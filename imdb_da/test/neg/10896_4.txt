Something is going on in this movie, directed by X-Files writer John Shiban, who has shown me. You get the feeling that the movie is moving, it's not all that seems, but I feel the movie is failing to give you enough to continue to really worry afterwards. It's about perception. There are signs that heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) meets in the movie, she talks to it and disappears. This may seem like a spoiler, but it is something that really only inherits a little focus on the part of the filmmakers. They seem to be having fun with us when we look curiously about whether we should trust what Nicole sees or not. It never gets a proper answer and I for one was a little clueless at that point. Time comes in a movie when ambiguity can just be frustrating, because the viewer is led on a wild goose hunt that ends in a dead end with a little explanation of what we have just seen. It ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of an exciting psycho-drama. Now there is nothing wrong with ambiguity in itself, but gives us something to lock on, or you will evade us. So I felt like I saw "Rest Stop". This film is apparently about a young woman named Nicole who decides to go to California with love Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to make it big in Hollywood. They do what should be a little detour in a rest stop, so Nicole can pee, but it falls in fear for her when she finds out that her Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a crusty, dusty yellow truck is a nutritious job that seems to cause a lot of trouble for Nicole, and we soon realize that he's behind Ises's disappearance when things start to happen, signs to her, if you want, she want to find their way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and has limited resources to defend against a lunatic who gives her some strong signs of how bad he can be. <br /> <br /> It's the easy part. When a female character comes into play, the movie makes a really bizarre leap from the logic as we are not sure where she came from, how she got there, and more importantly, where she goes, Nicole tries to break her free from her Supposed prison in the toilet is a utility company. She meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem like her savior, but when he is also a victim of the truck driver, exciting things arise again if he was actually there himself at first. The truck driver commits torture acts to Nicole (who hails her up in the toilet, and when she tries to loosen a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock, she receives an unpleasant bite from him). He puts fire in the toilet and leaves her without a lasting sanctuary from the animal. <br /> <br /> It's the timing of the truck driver's attack that has solved me. Maybe he just likes to bother her, but he looks appropriate in some situations where Nicole has time to escape or prepare. It does not make much sense, his motives, which evoke the film into an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It seems like I'm going on a limb here, that he likes having his quarry, thinking that they can only find an escape storm to stop that hope when he comes up with his next pig attack. But why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by having Nicole experience odd encounters with people who do not exist? What is the Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And to hang out of the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in an RV. They play a small role in the scheme of things like religious bigots themselves, but the film does not do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this movie at all.
