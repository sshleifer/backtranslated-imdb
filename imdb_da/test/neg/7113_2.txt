Live action version of Dragonball via Taiwan. Evil gentleman comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls ... are gems that when brought together will have a dragon to show up and give your desire. Lots of action and bad comedy follows. <br /> <br /> What can I say "the best way to watch this movie is with many drunk but witty friends" doesn't it? I do not know. This is a really bad but fun in the way that really bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where you actually see the wires. It's a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what I've seen on the show that it scares me for the big US budget version that is now recording. <br /> <br /> If you have some drunk friends and feel like picking up a movie watch this movie. If you want to see the sober (like me), avoid it.
