... when this movie was on. <br /> <br /> Which drill. An attempt at humor, but really not pulling it for good. Some good ideas were thrown, and the actors' makeup and wardrobe were OK. I was expecting much more, unfortunately I could not sit more of it, I turned off halfway through the video and ejected the tape, went to the rental shop to get my money back ...
