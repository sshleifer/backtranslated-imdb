I am a fan of Jess Franco's bizarre style and a lover of his trashier movies, and my personal opinion is that, in addition to several very entertaining films, he has also made a few masterpieces such as the brilliant "Paroxismus aka" Venus I Furs "from 1969, for example. However, it is an undeniable fact that the 180+ films that this highly productive filmmaker has directed to his career also include a bunch of great stinkers. "Sadomania" in 1981 is definitely one of those stinkers, just a very bad and plot smaller movie with the ability to drill hell out of you despite constant sleaze and nudity. <br /> <br /> Sure, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but as it continues and so on, it's likely to be bored after a short while. The only thing that really kept me in mind was the intensity of sleaze, which generously talked a little. After couple of newlyweds have been lost in the desert on an island, they are stopped by a bunch of topless women with weapons, guards at a local prison camp. While the man is banned from the island, the wife is taken to prison, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, ruled by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted governor. The prisoners are, of course, quite hot chickens, most of them are blondes, the male children are completely topless women with rifles. <br /> <br /> The reason, if you can call it that, is extremely stupid of course, but who will see it here for a good deal anyway. The (only) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of utilization, even for a "Women In Prison" movie. There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It is amazing, however, that a movie with this extreme level of sleaze can still be so boring. Sleaze will keep you going at the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I actually had difficulty falling asleep. It also makes me wonder why Jess Franco chose from all porn stars Ajita Wilson, who, according to most sources, was a transsexual who had been born a man (well perhaps for that very reason). If you really want to see this, be sure to have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it only for sleaze and exploitation (and perhaps for the small accidental fun factor). Don't expect to be very entertained, but it's almost incredible how a movie with such a high level of drag can be so boring. I'm a Jess Franco fan and I always want to be, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2.10
