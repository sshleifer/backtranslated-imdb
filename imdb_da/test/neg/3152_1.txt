That someone could have devised this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible. That it was actually broadcast on television, and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is the ingenious boggling. This stomach ulcer for the child's programming is almost too weak to comment on. I have burned - yes burnt - any Barney tape that people have given my son. To find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, do they get the smart children's actors? Have their parents no sense? These children will be on drugs before they are teenagers. Geez. The final insult is that I have to add this extra line to the notification to get it on IMDb.
