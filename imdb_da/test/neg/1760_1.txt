I had to write a review for this movie after I saw it last night and read some of the comments from people trying to classify this movie's dissatisfaction, going down to wfmitchell's post)). I do not fit any of these classifications. The second classification to be on the list is 5) People did not like this movie because it was not good. I found the movie to be drilled and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a great Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Talking about law, it took a long time and a tremendous amount of suspension of faith for me to believe in his southern accent. I can't wonder if they didn't make his character less flashy for that purpose, so we wouldn't have to hear the tortured accent so much. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it took a long time for it to become interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in its ending. What was interesting is that I didn't know that this movie was directed by Minghella. Ca. 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife "This will not be another English patient is it?" It was absolute. <br /> <br /> As for the battle scenes. I try to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that precisely describes it is simply "stupid". It was forced, it was incredible, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the fight, I looked at my wife and asked "was it just stupid?", As she nodded her head). <br /> <br /> The only bright point in the movie was Zellweger's performance. The role was a little over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her trip, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: "If you want to get 3 feet up from a bull's ass, all you have to do is listen to girlfriends talk to each other"), she could create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job a lot well. <br /> <br /> I simply didn't like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people who say they like it (or the English patient for that matter). I suppose you can categorize them into a category: 1) Soap opera fans
