I've seen many movies over the years and I'm a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is undoubtedly the WORST movie I have ever witnessed the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to watch it. If I could, I could return time, I would. I will regret as long as I live, the time I wasted saw this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story is so crazy; It just makes no sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who is after the Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $ 50,000 and the Germans after the head. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to escape The Pest, take the form of many aprons. But by doing so, we are witnessing some of the most annoying, worst-minded acts, dialogue and sounds of cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; at the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would probably drive depressed people to almost safe suicide. I mean, how can there be hope when a movie like this can be made? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is fun about a man who is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who can't act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? <br /> <br /> I went through it and thought the movie would get better, it would certainly. It didn't. Normally, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, all to get me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this movie, it is simply annoying and confusing. The witnesses have died even before they are told. I'm sorry for the camera men who have nothing to say about how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drift. I wouldn't be surprised if they received advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay healthy and part of the community, my advice is never to see this movie. I'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll ever hate anything more than this.
