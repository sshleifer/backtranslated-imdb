"Wired" should be considered one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen. The script and direction show a fantastic lack of imagination, and I'm sure most of the actors still cringe when someone mentions this movie. It fails to work either as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as a precise account of his short life. <br /> <br /> A meaningless mess without redeeming features.
