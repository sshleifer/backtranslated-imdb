So we have to find it fun that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - to the war zone - just to find out why her fianc√© didn't travel to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not even extremely fun, smart or entertaining - it's stupid - and it's also the movie. The leading actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialogue tries very hard to be fun (almost all the time), but it is never. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as far as the plot is concerned, have they ever bothered us to explain to us how the rebels are fighting (apart from being anti-government)? I guess it doesn't matter to anyone - either to the rebels or to the signs that just blindly flew to the battlefield. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is neither fun nor entertaining.
