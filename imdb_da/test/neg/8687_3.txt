The evil one starts at the 'San Sebastian Street 1683' as the 17th century ship ship lowers El Diablo in a violent thunderstorm. Go to 'San Sebastian's present day', where two divers explore the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, come across the sunken wreck of El Diablo & explore it, but are attacked and killed by something resembling an evil eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and operates a boat for hire called 'Vagrant Viking', suitable for tourists wishing to fish, dive and generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who appears to treasure as a hobby (well we all need to do something to pass the time right?) She hires Max & his gently dressed assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she can try find El Diablo & get rich. Talk of sunken treasure spans some of the more unscrupulous community members as they evade the criminals and thugs, it brought to Max & Sarah's attention that El Diablo has a creepy past, a past that still seems to leave the supernatural legacy behind even now ... Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb with a little help from the star Crawford, although the version I only saw Dubois, I thought The Evil Below had some potential and is a little different but unfortunately it is not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. The script by Arthur Payne starts OK with the two divers who are killed by a kind of marine animal, but this opening is NEVER referred to again, the creature is never seen again, and there are no more supernatural killings. The evil Below is a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, it does not seem to know what it will be like throwing bits and pieces of different genres in there from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery and religious nonsense as well. As a result, The Evil Below feels very bitty, fragmented, and since the best scene in the entire movie is the opening sequence I found myself, there was more and more frustrated due to lack of consistent horror as it went downhill quickly and the fact We never see the victory again. The Evil Below is blunt, slow, unwieldy, predictable, silly and lacks any kind of charm or intelligence, in short The Evil Below does not matter as a good movie should. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois fails to experience things though, of course, he shot lots of underwater wildlife, which I sometimes thought I saw a National Geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral and wildlife in general. Forget something gore, some blood-colored water and blood coughs are just as ugly as I get scared. Technically The Evil Below is very basic, it is bland and completely forgettable except for beautiful underwater photography of fish. This is point & shoot stuff & as a whole, the production values ​​are very low, even the place where this was shot does not seem to be very sunny or appealing. The action is poor, but again did you expect anything else? The evil one below is a bad movie, it's basic history is everywhere and it can't determine what it will be & as a result it ends up being a mess. Add it to the low production values, the fact there are no gore here and absolutely minimal horror content, you have a movie that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate and even so safe there are better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life. .
