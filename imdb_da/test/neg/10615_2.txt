There are movies that are leaders and films that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" were a leader. And here is one of its followers. "Party Camp" is about as exploitable as any of its brothers who plumbed the depths that "Meatballs" (the original) had mined success. Of course it had one Bill Murray. So what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter and which side dish SHE gives! Even as an innocent (flashing, blinking) girlfriend of a rich check (Cribb), she gives the hungry steam she gives to all her parts. And yes guys she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My darling, the smile of her could melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yes the movie. Nothing special as said; any cheap joke is aimed and hit (at perimeter level). And forever the teenager Jayne is good at a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there is just nudity, lame sex jokes, more nudity, a soft core dream sequence, a sex symbol nurse simply for (CLOTH!) Learning purpose, even more nudity .... <br /> < br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea Bill Murray was NOT in this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, of course. Lots of "Camp" but not much of a "Party".
