If Daphne Du Maurier had set REBECCA in the 1950s San Francisco, it could very well look like this upward, very unusual noir from Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a woman's death and sees herself in the life of Richard Basehart (who also acts as guardian of the dead woman's son) ... it is absurd and over-the-top but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is amazing, slowly falling apart as she understands the mistake she has made. Basehart is fine if it's a bit boring ... even though the lighting towards the end makes him seem very threatening. Fay Baker makes a very good Mrs. Danvers-like caretaker. Wise is a fine instructor, and he keeps things moving with a beautiful, sharp cut. He also makes a now classic uncontrolled car crash with Cortese (or at least a stunt Cortese) at the wheel.
