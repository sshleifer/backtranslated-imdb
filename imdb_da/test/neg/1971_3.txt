There were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason why I chose to watch it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Fantastic bad guy and I am always thrilled to see him in movies (even Home Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all your Aussies and Poms out there, this is a rare treat. Former neighbors star 80's palpitations dressed in drag selling drugs. But none of these things or the fact that the film is about the fabric / rave culture managed to make this film even extremely interesting. The script was boring, the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with J.D and any scene with Sienna I found everything about this movie pretty much past. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
