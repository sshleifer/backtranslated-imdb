Package American Tourist in Asia, recently suffering, has decided to break the law by: 1 ignoring curfew; 2 Connection to revolutionary army; 3 Possession and Use of Illegal Firearms ...... etc. What is meant to be a political and educational statement on the so-called atrocities in a military dictatorship in Asia ends as a "How To" travel guide to disillusioned Americans ... especially those who want to protest that the water in the hotel does not work .... Unfortunately, the authors of this stupid yarn have no idea about Asia ... nor does it appear in writing reasonable dialogue ... example: .. Our human rights hero desperately seeks medicine in the outbursts of the Asian jungle miles from anywhere, comes across a farmer and asks, "Excuse me - does this town have a pharmacy?" ... Well .... those who know something about Asian jungles will appreciate how ridiculous that scenario really is .... Remember, I was recently in the Thai jungle and an American asked me .... "Sorry .... do you know where is MacDonalds?" This movie is intended to be a serious drama, but ends up as a parody and rip-off of all these "kitten fields" -type movies designed to confirm the Asian stereotype held by much of the Western "civilization" and anchored by Hollywood Fantasies like this ..... The basic picture of this image is: "We Americans ... coming from the world's only true democracy, have a divine right to go to all other nations ... and correct their clock ... ... screw their environment ... and teach them freedom ..... "(see for example The Beach ...... in at least Leo did it with a bit more style .... .... of course Vietnam is another story .... And ..... the trained Asian may well ask why Yankie Gungh-Ho h antiquity to Asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has helped to spread cancer ... Aids .. Gun carrying kiddies and Jerry Springer ...... et al .. At the end of this picture can the cynical seer well bless for the burmese military ..... 3 out of 10. <br /> <br />
