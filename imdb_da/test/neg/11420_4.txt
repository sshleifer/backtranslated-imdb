There are rumors that a fourth underworld is going to happen. If so, the third part, which is also a prequel, will be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you ask yourself in what order you should watch the movies, so it makes sense ... In this case, I do not think so much. The third Underworld movie is not quite up to the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this lacks a few things and it feels like a cash. It seems that it does not go full throttle, which is a shame because the players could probably have used better material to work with. <br /> <br /> The story is ok, but it's nothing special. A good movie, but Rhona Mitra couldn't fill the shoes from Beckinsale (yes she plays another character, I mean the void that Kate B. left) ...
