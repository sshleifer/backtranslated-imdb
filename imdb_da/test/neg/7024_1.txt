I love Lucy, but this movie is so miserable that I am embarrassed by anyone interested in the first ten minutes. . . and it just got worse from there. Lucille Balls "song" is quite painful, and the attempts to make her seem more youthful using soft focus made me reach my reading bar. These are bombs like this that give bombs a bad name.
