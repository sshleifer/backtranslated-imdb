This movie begins great and sucks you in. Most trades are good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everybody else sounds British-like even the Muslim) shows up and shows he can't act. You can live with it until the first battle scene, where all of them fall apart. Why does Patrick Swayze struggle with an ax as he just put his sword in the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> There is further misplacement of swords a few minutes later, and people knowing about other people they shouldn't know. Other reviewers mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wasn't even worried about the battle scenes, sure the CGI Dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest downturn.
