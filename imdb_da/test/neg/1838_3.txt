I was looking forward to this movie when everyone was talking about it as a good horror movie and finally a European. So maybe my expectations were too high. It begins with a good silent horror / shock sequence, but it lets you instantly get down to the following scenes, where the plot begins to be introduced, as the actor and the character's motivation / life reveal no better than anything "made for television" drama . It keeps that way right into the end. <br /> <br /> About the scarecrows of the movies is certainly a good idea and another, but ALL scenes are of the "set it before" type. Overall, my idea of ​​this movie was that it had a good concept that was deployed in a mediocre story, bad acting, and less than tolerable plot gaps. <br /> <br />
