Turns me into a routine, as far as television films go. I think it's based on a true story because the plot seems too lumpy to be written by anyone with narrative skills. <br /> <br /> For example, the good old John Ritter (now a pretty big and bearded villain) is poisoning his wife enough to make her sick and accusing her of being psychosomatic and leaving her to marry another young woman immediately. Fourteen years pass before the story picks up again. Why fourteen years? I guess that even if the story doesn't require it, the story does. <br /> <br /> However, some of the special scenes are so cinematic that they were almost certainly dreamed of by an author. Pawing through her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbled upon an old electrical appliance and has one of the black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score - suddenly she remembers when fourteen years ago she discovered the Ritter shaving shells from a rectifier , gently collect them and put them in their shampoo and her eyelash liner (or whatever it is called). Later it develops that he also put it into her coffee. <br /> <br /> I honestly don't think so. I also do not believe that she had the special epiphany in the ceiling or that Ritter put her soap in her shampoo or eyeliner. The harness is featured in the film as a "toxic metal" and I assume that it is in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant sold over the counter in pharmacies and swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate - as nobody does in this movie - that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried nicotine patches and failed. So how does any selenium get in her shampoo, does Marg Helgenberger give immediate and drastic headaches? And her eyes become as painful as boiling when she uses makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple mindset "sympathetic magic", but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. Still, Ritter obviously tries the same stunt with her second wife fourteen years later, though there is no sign of trickery when she gets sick with the same symptoms. Wife number two is taken to Mexico and apparently cured, but suddenly drops died shortly after her return. There is significant evidence for Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops - when his first test is rejected, he smiles at Helgenberger, who asked for the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed by her death and its way. (I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems to be set up for third place in Ritter's marriage plan. (Sure.) The best performance is given by the guy playing Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? All others are trading the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railway crossing. But Danes do small things that are original. "I'm told you're going to report a murder. (Long pause while sitting down and waiting), then suddenly he breaks his face toward Helgeberger and asks in a fair and curious voice:" So who was murdered? "I suppose Apart from the naked bones of the historic gangs, nothing prevented signs or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in reality, I mean, Ritter is still in prison sentenced for murder and Helgenberger character is dead, so who should Objects? I wish the forensic medicine had become clearer. Ritter seems to have used so many toxins and toxic metals - let me see selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else - I was confused by it all, not that I had rooting for Ritter, here is a mathematician with a PhD who insists that people call him "doctor." He even corrects people who only address him as a professor. narcissistic problems behind them m very fast. "Jess calls me Whitey, although I know how to get a standard deviation and you don't. "Average TV fare.
