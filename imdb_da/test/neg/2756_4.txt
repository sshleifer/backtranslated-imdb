I saw the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not as bad as the low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least, the film has a few production values, and it apparently has a competent editor (unlike the movies that are really awful). The primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing signs at all. The main character, Marv, is so pathetic morose that he almost asks for all the bad things that happen to him. And he's not very smart either, or he would have figured out to stay away from the creepy girl Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv is his father, there is nothing but a drunk loser. The highlight of the movie is the heist sequence at the end, but even it is so weakly done, any tension it might have added to the movie is completely missing. At least this movie made for a very fun MST3K episode, like Mike and the Bots do a good job making fun.
