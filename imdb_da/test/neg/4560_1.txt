The municipality's comments make it sound like a very interesting movie, one that I would be deeply interested in. Unfortunately, the producers were unable to contain closed captions for the hearing impaired and deaf. It leaves me and countless others like me who rely on closed captions to follow a movie completely. <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable to any movie produced in 2005. In a world where all forms of disability and disability are occupied, it is disturbing and ironic that the ever sanctimonious entertainment industry fails to require all productions and cinemas are closed with captions.
