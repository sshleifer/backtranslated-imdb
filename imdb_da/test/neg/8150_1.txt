This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags, but they are not worth the wait. After an inexplicable argument between two guys who take up waste at a doctor's cinema we cut to a family that is leaving! Hollywood and driving driving driving their camper van over the screen over and over as inane dialogue is voiced over. At least I think it's inan, the terrible song that comes with this montage is mixed so high it sometimes makes the dialogue almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the camper arrives at night at a gas station where the family goes out, has another inauguration before they leave. The camera then spans to reveal the actor we've just seen drifting away. He speaks directly to the camera and we are aware that he is the director of the movie, we look at what is about him and how he came to make the movie. A good idea, which almost (but not entirely) makes the previous sequences worthy of the pain. <br /> <br /> When the film unfolds, he meets the two characters we met to pick waste at the start of the movie and they all make a movie business. <br /> <br /> All sorts of not very fun and clumsy comedy comes along as they put together a crew member and try to raise the money needed to start the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was apparently put together on a shoe string and a promise and there is a good little idea in here fighting to get out, but the execution is so unfortunate that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than anything that just falls over and everyone speaks (or shouts) immediately. So much of the dialogue here has been called by several actors at the same time - Robert Altman can do this kind of thing well because he has a script, repetitions, decent sound technologies and editing facilities. Everyone shouted at the one mike who, by the sound of it, was hidden in a trash can in the next room, does not make clarity.
