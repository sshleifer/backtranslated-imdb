On the pure theatrical side, Last Stand was great, as reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts for this battle found elsewhere that even though it is not as long or as flashy, it is far more historically comprehensive. <br /> <br /> Some small details, like the abuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and mispronounciations of various names and words, really ate on me. <br /> <br /> My guess would be that the "last stand of 300" was sent on the threshold of the theatrical release of "300", the history channel tried to run only on coattails of the movie's hype. <br /> <br /> If you are heading for a story that is historically accurate in every respect, you would have better luck elsewhere.
