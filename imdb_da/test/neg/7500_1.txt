So umm this woman has a vagina that sucks people into it when they do it and there is this guy who likes to follow her around ... everywhere .... and you're umm in love with her, And she can't love him back because of her stuff. Now she starts talking to her ... kind of ... it just says to give birth to me again and again and she tries to feed that hot dog, but it doesn't work because it ummmmm wants fresh meat?!? !!? Then this woman leads to the Red Light District where she picks up tourists, but only the really sleazy them because I think they deserve it, and after a while this guy comes looking for her, and even though shes like right here he doesn't see her so gradually he gets involved with linked twins, but he only likes one of them because the other is a real hussy. This is not bad good, as I thought it would be, why the novelty kind of wear out within the first 1/2 hour, and it goes on for an hour. I think it killed a few brain cells because I was through this whole thing and now I'm a little brain damaged. Either way man is the worst man-eating vagina movie I've ever seen.
