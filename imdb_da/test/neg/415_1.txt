First, I loved the book, more than the more popular Da Vinci Code, and although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever see angles and demons ever again. <br /> <br /> The film hardly resembles the book, in fact, only the general premise of the story is there. <br /> <br /> From the start of the film I was disappointed, in the book Robert Langdon received a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Who finds the Father's body (can't remember the name) and then asks Langdon to come up with the super fast plane ... In the book were the only ones who knew about this technology, which the Father and the Daughter Team had created, themselves and camerlingo ... In the film, however, there was a massive team involved ... so the excitement was never there ... how did they find out etc. Leaving or rather changing this whole part of the story was a big mistake and it was in my opinion who made it a bad movie ... it changed everything that happened from then on when Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheelchair, the commander rushed in to get camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti, in the movie it was commander in space and Olivetti was shot ... (i think i got it right, but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the movie) ... There was no love interest betwee n Vittoria and Robert and i She was not at CERN when he arrived and was actually flown in from her research work. In the book all four favorites were killed, but in the film survived the last of the four wells. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped, and Robert had to save her, and it was those who killed Assassin in the Illuminati Church, not blown up as if he were in the movie of Camerlingo. The piece where Robert was restricted under a cobblestone was not there, hidden by his Mickey Mouse watch alarm. OK in the book, we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit stretched, but it was important in the movie because he had to drive back with the movie ... There did not mention how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved, it was also important to get to know the Vittoria character. <br /> <br /> In all one of the worse movies I've seen, I'd have left early, but my brain became numb and I temporarily lost the use of my legs. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly bad attempt and not one of Ron Howard's finest, in fact, how he will get back to work is beyond me !!! I want my money back !!!
