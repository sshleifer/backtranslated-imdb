I saw last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most hit or miss instructor of note ever. Despite its "stellar power", this show is completely unconvincing, and its political insights - which I as a proud liberal in no way disagree with - are superficial and lumpy and seem to be torn from the headlines of America today, despite the fact that it comes out of the mouth of someone who appreciated as Mario Cuomo. The drama as such is not very dramatic, and comedy is not fun. The only points of interest really see how New Yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to assemble a show that continues to insist has something cool from 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to the cinema Have been the art of having all your actors talked at once, the effect of which is to feel depressed as if they were strangers at a wedding.
