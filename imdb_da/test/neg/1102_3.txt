I can't believe I'm getting into this movie to get an advantage my friends ask me early on April 14, 2007. This movie is definitely a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring, I don't even have felt the gory impact of his "scary scenes" which I consider totally incapable of attracting the audience. The worst even trampled me because my friend failed to get on time at the theater because she was busy helping her boyfriend search for a suitable lodge to stay for one night. I was not really disappointed with the case, but this movie is actually a case for me, bad plot, useless story, naively created, and I don't know what to say anymore. <br /> <br /> The title doesn't do I still suggest creeps and horror, we couldn't overture us viewers. Perhaps the slaughter of the animals can get more to crawl if they show it in theaters, the real game play. Good luck to anyone trying to see it anyway.
