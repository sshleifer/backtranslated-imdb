Very simple, they are all the syndicated episodes and NOT the original unknown / unedited NBC episodes. It is NOT the complete first season, all eps are edited to clear at 9pm for syndication, which means jokes are cut, an additional commercial dish is included. All Harvey Korman intro is not here ... very poorly done! Shame on a series I've been waiting for .... booooooooooooooooo! If you are a true die hard Mama fan, don't buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we are dissatisfied with this slaughtering job for a classic sitcom!
