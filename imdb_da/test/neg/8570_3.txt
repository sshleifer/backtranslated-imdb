The heading describes it exactly. This dribble of a movie was no more than the typical 'group of teenagers accidentally killed a person now that someone is jumping / killing them 20 years later' crap that has been pushed down the neck for decades. The only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho / loser, it was a nun. Nun wants to remove the sin from the girls, among other things, girls randomly / intentionally drown the nun, blah blah, non fighting the girls, people die, movies end. The only thing that made this happen was death scenes that were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping from this fat lady's arms), but even they couldn't make this a good movie. Brian Yuzna was supposed to hang his head to commit to this refusal. I'm sure I rented it and didn't buy it, or I would be furious without faith. If you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses, see Demonia or something. Stay away from this waste.
