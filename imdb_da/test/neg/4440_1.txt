Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a boring, gloomy, difficult to follow thriller, where you finally give up after a while, because it's so complicated. I remember seeing this on my local twin at the opening weekend with a full house. When the picture ended, it was less than a quarter full. Never have I witnessed such a mass exodus without being an emergency to drive people out. It must tell you how bad it is. I think it's the worst movie ever made that involves a great talent in front of and behind the camera.
