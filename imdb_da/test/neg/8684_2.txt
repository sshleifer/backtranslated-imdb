This movie was a total yawn party that took forever to get started but never really did. It was simply boring to see, as much as I could never really get into it. This movie is not a horror movie of a fantasy series, as the cover of the video tape made it one. Instead, it is a thriller type of movie with a few elements of horror thrown in to make the movie more interesting. Of course, this movie does not help. Most of all I remember is that this movie was a bit like a movie from the 1970s called "The Deep". Flock looking for treasure, rival groups, that kind of thing. There are also supernatural phrases in it, but to tell you the truth, I was so boring when I looked at this movie that I kind of radiated, so I can't really tell you what the supernatural elements were. I am kind of remembering footsteps at the bottom of the ocean, so maybe it was kind of going dead, or I can think of Lucio Fulcio's "Zombie" movie instead of one being a horror movie put in a tropical island and as outlandish as the one it was much more entertaining than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover art.
