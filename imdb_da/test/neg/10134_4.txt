Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum in the Dark Ages, and a revived vampire and his maniacal sidekick chase you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I want to say inside the innocent Virgin of Neurenberg's torture device because there is a good risk of you being brutally spiked to death. And yet, the older lady in this movie runs stupidly into her nail list. "Vampire's coffin" is a rather disappointing successor, as director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but emphasizes comic situations and dialogues. No more vicious castles with spooky cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants who provoke laughs instead of fear. The story opens inside Count de Lavud's last resting place, where a prominent doctor and an assistant assistant steal the coffin to examine the body at a private clinic. Of course, the wooden stick is removed from his heart, and the vampire count is going to live again, and immediately the toddler slaves to do his dirty work. The vampire has an eye on a beautiful female patient in the clinic, and it is up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to save his soul and to destroy blood sugar. "Vampire's coffin" uses a limited amount of places and there is very little action. The whole movie would actually be pretty boring if it wasn't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. However, the photography is fantastic, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is especially true during the scene where Count de Lavud steals a young woman through the small desert streets at night. It's the only truly worthwhile scene for the whole movie, the rest is pretty mediocre and déjà-vu.
