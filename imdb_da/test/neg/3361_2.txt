Hi I am Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first Cannonite review show. My movie this week was debatable, which route which movie, which excellent four star epic would I choose, guess what I decided to draw an 80 and go the other route, I decided to browse a movie so embarrassing that it completely killed what there could have been a very unique concept. The movie I want to review today is Jack Frost Two's revenge from the mutant killer snowman. The stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel, and Scott MacDonald as the Suicide Man Frost. It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly fun Jack Frost (loved carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe this is the same. The film was destroyed for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a sign that was totally deadly snow-white food. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid when he did in the original, his babbling about anti-freeze was one of the most pathetic screen I had seen in a movie. However, his wife was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the main woman of a hilt. She was a rationale in films of pure idiocy. The scene where she figured out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. Ray MacDonald did another good job as Jack Frost despite what he got. If it wasn't for such weak characters, he could have been immortalized like Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh, if you should, but when it comes to that, Jack Frost had spunk, he had humor, and most importantly he had an incredibly vicious stripe. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much more, it could have been a continuation of a big franchise, but instead plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets me two out of ten for me and it is fortunate that it even gets one.
