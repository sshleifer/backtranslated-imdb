As a fan of hospital and medical shows, I have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman) that brings a little light relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I had expected the bad to be punished and the good resettled. Instead, the hospital management is even more fooled by itself in an incredible way, and it gets worse and worse for the good. You can't help wondering what the unions are doing or not Rob, Donna and Maria know which unions exist? In addition, you never see outside, trees, grass, sunlight is a little oppressive. Someone understood what the last words were? that is, the answer Rob Lake gave to Mrs Strawberry's child question "Why are you telling us all that?" It was very frustrating not to understand it.
