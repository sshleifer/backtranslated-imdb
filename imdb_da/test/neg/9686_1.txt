Who wrote the script for this movie, the staff at Disney Studios?! This is the most inacurrate adaptation of any story ever! I would laugh at a couple of scenes and cry at others, and that was only because of how pathetic it was. I have to give it credit, it had some fun scenes, but I could have spent better time with my evening. Very rarely do I turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way through.
