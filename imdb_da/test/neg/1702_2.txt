I had great hopes for this production, which is one of my favorite works. In fact, it is very reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but lacks the devil with which the original character is infused. Many of the smaller characters do well and the Scottish settings are great. The big disappointment to me is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines out of a cue card with the wrong glasses - for sure for the first time too. He can do so much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979), which in my opinion gave the gold standard performance, will struggle to be valued, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind before I could get through it - hardly a big sign. Honestly, one to avoid.
