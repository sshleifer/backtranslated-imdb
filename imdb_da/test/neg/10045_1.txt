I watched this movie yesterday and thought it was terrible; It was pointless and simply stupid. The supposed plot concerned a potential groom who was also caught up in the world's problems to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with a selection of usirdos. <br /> <br /> We saw it with a bus load of people heading down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed it was a horrible movie. It was trying to be deep, but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. If I wasn't on a bus, I'd have gone out on the movie. Anyone considering watching the movie or renting or buying the video you have been warned about.
