This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC Miniseries DVD. I loved the six movies. They were well-behaved, well-written and historically accurate. I actually read Gregory's book and liked it enough, despite being major historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole false homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention it. That angle was one of the book's main points. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie just lets me ask "why?" Why do we see, as another suitably puts, "The Real World: Tudor England"? Why are the camera angles so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improv, but come on! The actors sometimes stiffen and stumble across their lines, and it is obvious that they make them up while walking together. Why are sex scenes so cumbersome? The way they were done in the book at least made them interesting. In the movie they are just bad and go on to be completely funny. At one point, the actor who played Mary Boleyn was sex with the actor who played Henry VIII. He throws away and she has this look on her face that says "Hm .... I have to go to the store. Is he finished yet? Maybe if he's done I can get some cheese really fast ..." It's just bad. Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small role in this movie? Her refusal to get divorce was one of the leading causes of the scandal that rocked Christiandom. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not get married instantly. Why is she not here? Over all, this movie is just bad.
