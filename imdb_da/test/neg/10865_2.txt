Okay, so author / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to produce his own movie and fill the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really needs is inspiration and talent to come up with an actual valuable scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe overdue crap he wrote down here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It is a hectic and hopelessly inappropriate fan-boy attempt to pay tribute to the infamous biker flicks of the 60s and to the recently revived Grindhouse movie formula in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop fails in her setup and there are many obvious reasons for this. He doesn't have a story to tell ?? or at least not a very interesting one ?? But seriously trying to cover this up through numerous superfluous plot twists, lots of free and very women-unfriendly sleaze, long-lasting and piteous dialogues that strive to be cool and gigantic amounts of meaningless violence. The plot looks complex, but can actually be summed up in a sentence. The old vendetta between two rival biker bands flares up again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who can be the longest lost son of a double cross that was executed in 1976. That's it, seriously! All in all, from betraying remnants to recruiting old hour members to toys with their nymphomaniac informant girl, everything is completely meaningless and confusing upholstery. Another big problem in "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's very own enormous and seemingly insatiable ego. He should certainly not have rewarded himself with the role of a hard and relentless gang leader, as it only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. Granted, Bishop starred in a pair of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but it was a long time ago and he is honestly nothing good as an actor. Perhaps it was simply the bishop's lifelong dream to play a character who always throws his enemies and which every hot treasure sexually demands, and just wrote a whole manuscript around it. The veterans in the casting, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, do not really interfere with giving a plausible impression, and I cannot say that I blame them. This whole production is paralyzed and pathetic, and I can't recommend it to anyone, regardless of the many beautiful babes mated with just breasts and naked butt.
