Oh yes, I admit that I have been guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of waste. I can't say that I was forced by foreigners who pointed a gun upside down, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this horrible excuse on a movie. No, I did it with free will. I have deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the facts here guys. - The act is an insult to humanity. - The reason (if it exists) is ridiculous. - The character development is horrible - The characters shown in the movie are so clever that you would recognize them in your average cartoon. - Editing is sloppy and imaginative. - The camera work is low key. - The dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - The management: well let's say I bet it wasn't Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> So to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved whats ever. The director must smoke crack now to forgive for inflicting this poison on the world. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made. PERMANENT!
