Being the sci-fi fan I am was always curious about this movie. So I was thrilled to see the journey to the far side of the Sun finally being released on an affordable DVD (the previous print had downloaded $ 100 on eBay - I am sure they want them to have the money back - but more about it in a second). <br /> <br /> In any case, the premise of this movie (like the Twilight Zone's "The Parallel") is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling the earth on "the other side of the sun". Of course, this planet is exactly like ours, except that it is inverted. This basically means that their letters are reversed and people are driving on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sound Interesting? Well that's pretty much everything for this movie. The first hour or so is dedicated to preparing for the journey to this other planet. It is just boring scenes of switches that are pressed, banal dialogue, etc. There is no point in it at all. Gerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actors in cinema history to play most roles. I think they are so boring, I'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to complete the movie. At least, when the crew finally lands on the planet (after an intermittent sequence of astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes notes that the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and bounces back on another ship to tell people what he has discovered. Oops, he never gets to do that when he crashes lands and dies. The end! Oh wait, there is a bonus scene of one of the spacecraft throwing himself in a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I guess he's out of this movie too. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised that a movie like this could get even back in the 60s. Rent if you need to. DO NOT BUY.
