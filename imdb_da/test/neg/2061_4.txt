A girl is searching for her soul - this film was very strange - lots of sequences that resemble hallucinations. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable on the picture. It was hard to figure out what the director was trying to say - most of the time, the protagonist is dressed in strange clothes and makeup. A strange combination of reality and madness.
