I would not recommend it to anyone except biographers who like to laugh at a movie, not with it. Quite promising terms and sets of actors are gradually getting worse over a movie ending with perhaps the worst end ever seen in a movie. I won't ruin it, but the most used set of movie clich√©s is basically half-hearted for the most disappointing last five minutes for any movie, ever. The movie also features the most offensive scene ever, the attempt on screen chemistry between the two main roles when presented with a close-up of Angela Jolie who stretches Denzel Washington's finger lovingly. It may be the only thing he could move, but it is certain that the viewer is treated to a zoom of Washington's finger that is beaten between the kinds of muted lights and music that fits a sex scene is beyond me. I laughed loudly and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of Storylin was far from the Se7, but here it is done much more simplistically and far too clearly. Calling it a poor Se7 would be an understatement, it really is nothing more than one made for television movies, and even Jolie and Washington's best efforts cannot convince that this is a box office movie.
