Last night I participated in a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were so excited to learn when we got there that the director / author, producer (his wife) and several cast members were also present and there would be a discussion and Q&A after the movie. But when the film was over and the credits began to roll (and the film wasn't really edited enough and is too long), my cousin and I immediately got up and went without hearing each other. We found out that we once started talking outside that we both felt so angry that we would not only stop the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew that had been near the exit and who we went right by when we left. I figured that my anger was red-planted under the scene where Jerry sliced ​​his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so her blood could be used to leave a false path. It was inevitable to link the physical pain, he affected his body with the emotional pain he inflicted on his spirit by murdering his mother and two brothers in her presence, saving her, and taking her with him as he fled. I have cut my palm before (accidentally); Even a superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to heal if you do not keep it motionless because you just keep the opening up trying to go about your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsy around her palm and a scene with a great band aid, it was as if she had never been cut. My anger reached its peak - I will not spoil this moment for you - in Celinas last scene. I became angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the movie (the actress portrays her is a good one); I was ?? And you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know this? Immersed in the feeling of both its physical and emotional pain; and the scriptwriter also treated Celinas emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience, cavalry and with completely disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Of course, the script has instant tears for Celina, and a dialogue that tells us she's hurting somewhere. But at this point we feel the audience so manipulated that we have shut down. The manipulation starts very early in this movie when Jerry's family dialogue tells the public that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, writers: Give your audience some credit. Let them do a great deal of creative work alone. Tell the story; Do not explain to us everything we need to think and feel. We don't like it. My cousin also knew that she had trouble with the movie early on in dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other in addition to this, f *** it, you. Some couples actually find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every second word out of their mouth. But it is like watching comedians cursing a lot. Some of them are really funny; The curse is subordinate. But some of them replace the curse of humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This man and wife team bravely chose to tackle a very complex story with horribly complicated characters. But they do not seem to have realized that the importance of a story, especially a complex, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires attention to important factual details, and does not work desperately to interpret the significance of history for the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to watch movies released that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important, at all possible levels, that we hear them. But I am less than thrilled that this narrator decided before the movie itself began, what Jerry's story meant and continued to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.
