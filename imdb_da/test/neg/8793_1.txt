I just realized why the colors and sets in the "Sakuran" were so flashy and flashy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a first-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono was always better and more expensive than other kimono, so the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the protagonist, or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the cribs. You couldn't call it acting. It was nothing but catering for her flip-out, high-school-girl fan base. Hi Anna, good luck on the one you grow older. Yes, right, an oiran like a raw and vulgar, exposed to violence, biker chick. Have we not already seen you portray this character in a more appropriate movie? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? An unpleasant little bitch always stays true to herself, which is just that: an unpleasant bitch. She finds that men inexplicably attract her and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful high-class prostitute, even though she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a women's bond. This so-called seductive ability for her is talked about, but we never see it in action, probably because of the inexperienced bikerchick's ineptitude, I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and strong man angry with her because she keeps him waiting while serving a much inferior customer. Not much oiran-like, is it? How could such a woman ever be an oiran? Oh, because the previous oiran was killed, and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for a lock so cheap? Rumors are about How could there be no consequences for what she did for the powerful guy? Because screenwriters are hidden. They just made a lot of crap. Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her (why?) And she throws him over to a pencil-free guy who is generally cold and distant to her, but respects who she really is (which is not sensible. How can anyone respect someone so worthless?). When talking about shed, it is what the director struck down and took a big, psychedelic-colored dump about the aesthetics of aesthetics, culture and society. What about such things as sabi, mono not attentive, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigid hierarchical society? Everyone quakes by a director who comes out as a pointless, nouveau-rich couple. The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese, in watching this movie, crashed around the director and took steaming spoons of this burning, smelly crap and exclaimed how tasty it was. Argentine tango music with violin and bandoneon as the backdrop for the Edo Period, when Japan was completely isolated from the international world (except the 3.7 hectares of Dejima)? Why not just have Anna, the bad-ass biker, answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was scary and anachronistic (the same as the art design). <br /> <br /> In the end, I thought there were only two or three small flowers on the shrine of the shrine. But earlier she said that she would leave the quarters when it flourished, we all knew what would happen. How boring that the telegraphs end so clearly. But what is the meaning of the old tree that blooms? The rich and powerful guy who has already made the happy quarter blooms in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in the spring. It didn't impress her at all? No, of course not. I already know about whores. The guys who treat them nicely are kicked in the balls. Perhaps it is bowing to the horns to make people idealize them when they themselves know the truth about who they are: just cheap and worthless. Given the instructor's obsession with goldfish, the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a porch accidentally struck. Two fish tumble into a stream carrying them away to escape beyond the oblivion of the pleasure quarter, regretting how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and cannot survive outside (like the denizen's relationship with the pleasure district). Otherwise, the fate of the fate of the goldfish is no sense. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were full of flower, but the shortness of the flower is one thing special about cherry blossoms. I couldn't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and heat from the stage. The sky would move quickly from the shadows to a deeper gloom, and the night would fall. It would be cold, very cold. And dark. It really wasn't a happy end, was it? Romantic Love (in the Edo Period?) Could survive because of terrible poverty and be ejected as long as the cherry trees flourished. Maybe a few days, unless it rained before. But the unknown romantic love we see here? It is the existence of this period incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya goes off shoes for a while? She couldn't do it. Literally. Check out the scene on her "promenade" where she seems to wear the right footwear, but she should stick to a guy's shoulder to stay on without stumbling on her ass. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie two stars for the artistic direction, but then I realized what it was all about: sick dominance by the director. These colors and sets are just as the instructor has to scream: "I'm the most important one here! Me! It's about me !!!!"
