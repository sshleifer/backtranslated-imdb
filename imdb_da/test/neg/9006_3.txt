I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and free. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most sympathetic character (the only other time I liked him was in "A Bug's Life"!) Speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was annoying without faith, and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional can be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him a reality.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two amazing scenes (both involving the museum captain and not involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wish I was at home watching television golf.
