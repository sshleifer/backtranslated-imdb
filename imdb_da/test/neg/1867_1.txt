All movies containing "goofy sound effects" must be shot. If there is one thing I HATE, it must be the use of a "Whoop Whoop Whoo" when someone hits the head. The only movies I've seen to do this are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when in the bar, and Pixie beats the guy in the red dress with a beer bottle ... or rather flatters him with a beer bottle because she doesn't hit him Really with it. Yes Ghoulies IV sucks. But I have to wonder that they thought not to make the so-called "Ghoulies" mouth move when they probably spoke? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better mask out of building paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. This sucked.
