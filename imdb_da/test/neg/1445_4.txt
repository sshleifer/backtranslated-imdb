I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Since then I have seen it a number of times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would have been a complete piece of horror art in two hours. As it stands, the maturity is only one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Ex-Twisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote, produced and starred in this 1998 chock party seen in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies of human evolution and a love of near death experiences. Hendricks is no pushover, he is a pumped up six foot "modern primitive". Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to very extreme. When he makes his first full look in the movie, it's a scary sight. <br /> <br /> Hendricks' greatest hobby of life is sharing his "spiritual revivals" with his kidnapped victims. He visits the internet chat rooms under the name "Capt. Howdy" and then invites people to his house. They think they're going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendrick's lakes and mouths close and torture them by holding knives and hooks in many parts of their body. If it sounds sick, it is because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage is not only able to save her, but also arrests Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the community's disapproval. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his old self. The rest of the movie I will leave you, to say only that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you in tremors. With the exception of Snider, the play is not too good, but it can be used. The direction is okay too. There are some humorous parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's great and worth buying if you love rock. Overall, it is a movie that is worth watching. If you love low budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. You will probably have it.
