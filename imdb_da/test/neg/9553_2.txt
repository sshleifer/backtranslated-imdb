Boston Blackie movies have some strengths - mostly because the pacing is fast and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances. But the plotting is often terrible, and the countless comics often kill the pacings (if the plot happens to be atypical) or is just unfunny and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> This involves Blackie chasing an asylum escapee (Steve Cochran in a really bad performance), which has been fixed on the beautiful Nina Foch (who puts in a nice, rather subtle, job). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has gone gay madness (he has at least some evidence of this) and is incompetent trying to imprison him as Blackie goes after the real killer. The reason has possibilities, but whenever a genuine excitement starts, we get a not fun comedy routine. It does not seem that anyone in Columbia understood that in a movie about the practice of a truly dangerous madman, sweet little comedy scenes disturbing an inconvenient body from the inspector disturbs any willing suspension of disbelief. (You just conclude that our clever heroes are an idiot - deadly for a movie like this.) <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time. For a well-depicted episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
