Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from La Brea Tar in Los Angeles. While trying to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ridiculous premise, you will still shout with laughter at the inane dialogue, inappropriate plot contrivances, and wild rose-free scientific plot holes that parade across the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to perform in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. It was the Tommy Lee Jones tour. Although he does a decent job, the script is just as pathetic even though he goes down in flames (unfortunately sorry). Most of the support casting is also cattle choked; A few of the players simply speak in their roles. Anne Heche in particular deserves the Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward depiction of a scientist. She is as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even at least he would have made a better play. As the scientific plot holes are too many to list here, I would instead suggest that you screen the movie with friends and have a game of "Finding the Scientific Absurdities." The loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie as "Everybody Looks The Same" over and over again. Here is an example of the kind of nonsense you can expect: A system for blowing up a building is designed, constructed and dynamite set and detonated all within a period of approx. 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the mandatory disaster film clich√©s: divorced dads, scientists ignored by everyone, unpleasant police, hard street kids, bratty teens, greedy investors, etc .; everyone is present and in abundance. The film also bases you on the head with a relentless barring of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for fans of cheese and sadness. All other viewers: beware.
