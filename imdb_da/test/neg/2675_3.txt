If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the series fans, Halloween 6 is like a vicious insult. The story has gone to the dogs all together. Michael is used as a helpless farmer in this movie and he is not scary at all. He reminds me of an overweight alcoholic than the bogeyman who hit fear in our hearts back in the original. There are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature, and I am so happy that the H20 came out because it would be an insult to the fans to make it fresh on our minds. Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was a nice touch and it linked it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie to end an otherwise good career at). When he is on the screen, he reminds you of the good old days as Halloween was actually scary. <br /> <br /> It's about it, my friends. The stalk sequences are unoriginal. One of them is a blatant rip-off of Laurie / Michael's chase in the original. The other characters are terribly signed and just not pleasant. The music, at Halloween's highlights, even when the movie is bad, is being tortured in this movie. We get a silly rock version of the stalk / hunting theme. What did they think when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was killed by the character Jamie (now played by another actor who is not worth mentioning) We saw this character escape death in two movies . We root for her, and when she is killed in this movie, you can't help but be sad and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a movie. * THAN SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less said the embarrassment the better. I wish it didn't exist. I suggest skipping this movie, and even 5, and just go straight to the H20 because if you see this you might not see another Halloween movie again.
