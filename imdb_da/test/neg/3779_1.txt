I have heard that this step was put together by a bunch of high school students. As a gymnasium art or theater project, it is not that bad. Unless you lived near milpitas in the 70's or knew someone involved in the movie, it's pretty awful. Most of the actors are obviously not actors, but the locals who volunteer. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features at KTVU in Oakland appears, but only for about a minute). Some of the monster effects are made with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster funnel and each works okay on their own, but there is no continuity between the two. If you see without dialogue, you will assume that the movie had 2 monsters. I think the most inevitable aspect is that even the protagonists, whom I assume, are the children behind the movie, can't even pretend to act. These children must have been involved in theater somehow to do this project, but they do not show any credible feelings in front of the camera.
