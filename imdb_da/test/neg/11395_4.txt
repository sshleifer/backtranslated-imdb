After watching this movie, I thought of myself, they really raised Errol Flyn's life! The film is really nice eye light. They really got the atmosphere in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. Costumes were great. All the women look glamorous and all the men look beautiful and debonair. Is this a serious movie about Errol Flyn's life? Oh! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous things he did in his life. Why do I criticize this movie? This is a movie that had many promises but failed to deliver. Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn. He was not as handsome as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not just a beautiful playboy who did not take seriously, but as a man who was endowed with great talent, was disturbed and unhappy. Flynn's love life was a disaster when he had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his life. He also suffered from untouched love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene in the film showed Errol that he asked Olivia to stay with him, and instead she went away. He is shown in his tux, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool as he puts his drink in the pot. It was a sad way to end the movie, but a little fitting, because everyone knows now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his scattered lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This movie could have had much more depth, I could have been better written. Sure they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into Errol Flyn's character, even though the film did not put any depth into it. <br /> <br /> I'll probably never watch this movie again, but I still remember watching this movie, "Gosh, it could have been so much more .....!" I give this movie a D +.
