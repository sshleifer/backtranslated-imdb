This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit that I didn't see it from the beginning to the end, as the cleaning of the toilet was more entertaining. <br /> <br /> "Star" was the most unpleasant sign I have ever seen, either fun or attractive, in fact, creepy and unpleasant are far too free. It is painful to see, there is no action, especially not from the star, who behaves like a doped psychologically deficient end in one of them high-mouthed black actors. <br /> <br /> As horrible as seeing one of those who can't keep up with black actors, it's even worse to see a Puerto Rican. <br /> <br /> The film's name is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.
