Why would a movie producer with a track record like Wes Craven like to borrow his name for a boring collection of clichés like this is anyone's guess. And if he blunted any money for it - the whole £ 50 judging by the look - he should have knocked on the director's door for a refund the moment the movie was released. There are many "Alien" rip-offs, and this is one of the worst. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen, sitting with a sign stupid enough to let his children wander around a dangerous government lab, can't save it. As a cure for insomnia, this rates a 10+. As a piece of quality film production - forget it.
