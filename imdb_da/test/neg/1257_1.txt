An insult to both poker and cinema, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant and fascinating figure in poker history a complete drill. Still a fun movie to joke about, from the first half lame gangster movie clich√©s to the incomprehensible nonsense of the second hour. Fortunately, Stu Ungar wins all three of his World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. His notorious dealer abuses? 1 scene. His cook's habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't even get any real poker players. What did they cover? A lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. Oh, and a montage of Stu waking up every day and shopping for meat that doesn't come anywhere near to make sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp, which is trying to make money from the poker game? Because I think there is still a big movie to be made about Stu Ungar and waiting for someone to be willing to do it right.
