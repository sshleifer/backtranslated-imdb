It's hard to turn up this story. BIG book / GOOD movie version from Fred Zinneman, but this movie is AWFUL! First, casting was terrible. Richard Gere should play Jackal himself when Edward Fox was a similar type of cypher, and they didn't have to mess with the original script by adding so much worthless (animal) fluff. This movie reminded me of so many Bruce Willis movies as you see huge expenses with nothing cinematic to show for it. (It's his "Conspiracy Theory") It takes some real things to make a movie, so bad from such a good original script. Every person from Michael Caton Jones down should be banned from making movies for 10 years; Such is the insult this movie is for real filmmakers. Was Hollywood to try not to have any idea what they were doing, this movie would be show A. Shame on you ALL!
