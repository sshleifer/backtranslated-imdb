After watching this movie I couldn't help but notice the parallels between it and another movie called America 3000. Both were very bad in the mid-1980s after apocalypse catastrophes on celluloid. Of course, fake sets, wood plays and stupid monsters are found in both films. About the only difference between the two is that the leading scourge here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very clear accent. Avoid this unless you see the MST3K version. Joel and bots hardly miss this turkey.
