I could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer, but the lid on the DVD box made me rent it anyway. Boy was I really. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and unclear (in terms of video quality). It looks like they shot the whole movie with a 20-year-old video camera, it looks so bad. I really didn't like the plot and after watching the movie I was very disappointed. I don't want to tell any spoilers, but let's say the end was so bad that I laughed, it's been done so many times before. The whole story seems like something that came out of a middle school's English paper. If I were to shoot a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it might just be it. I can't believe they actually released this movie. It's really not worth the rent or a penny of everyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the expense of the movie.
