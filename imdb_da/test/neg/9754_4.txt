I was not really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to watch this movie, especially because she is so in love with Channing Tatum, I constantly tease her about it and say it is the one the only reason she loved the movie. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, take the lead and save the last dance that I should love Step Up, eh, what dunk? I think all movies somehow have the right to see. <br /> <br /> Do you know the movies I just mentioned at the top? Dirty Dancing, Take Lead and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it, and that's what you have. Not to mention, if you've seen these movies, you honestly have seen Step Up. Because Channing is lower class with street smarts that just naturally feel the music while the snobbish class girl must follow step by step, how will they fall in love if they are so different? After all, it's their chance to "step up" to the passion, mystery and desire of the dance! OK, it was a silly explanation, but as I said, as long as you have seen the movies I mentioned, or even if you just got the plot, you get the movie. I don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, I bet it's the Channing lovers! LAUGH OUT LOUD! I'm kidding you, but that's all good, I don't think I just got what others did with the passion, the mystery that is dancing! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you? <br /> <br /> 4/10
