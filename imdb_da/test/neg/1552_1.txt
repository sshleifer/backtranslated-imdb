I only rented this stink because of its relatively high ratings. It sucked completely! I can't imagine how anyone would think this a good movie - even an OK movie. None of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind. To varying degrees, they were each selfish and medieval - or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the spirit of Christmas (when it does!) I know Canadians and like them - but I can't believe that even they would think it here a good movie. I'd rather have a sharp stick in the eye than see this offensive movie again. A huge waste of time and money. Do not believe in the person who wrote the opinion that it was "worth seeing." This person would probably enjoy a dentist drill the teeth without anesthesia as well. Don't mean to be unfriendly, but for my life I can't imagine what that person was thinking. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe he was director or producer. If so, I'd like to ask them to give me back my money. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drag - or rent something (something!) Otherwise. I run out of good reason NOT to rent this movie. If I was Canadian, I would be disappointed that it would be a favorite Canadian flick. If so, I would say that those who believe it definitely need large amounts of powerful drugs. Yeck!
