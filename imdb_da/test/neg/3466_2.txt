I thought this movie would be good. It was definitely not despite the Oscar-winning leading players. I might have been due once, and I've never heard anyone else in the theater laugh. Renee Zellweger's pancake make-up was very carefree. Everyone seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick, but not pulling it off. I think maybe the movie should have listened well to development, but something was lost in translation. Were the roaring 20's really here? I do not think. Everything seems a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The movie is in sepia tones, just like any other movie that takes place in the 20s or 30s. There is just not so much originality here.
