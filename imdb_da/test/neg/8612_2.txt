First of all, I will admit that I haven't seen Vampires: Los Muertos, but I've seen the original Vampire movie and love it. I rented this movie after hearing something about it. I didn't expect to be impressed. I was not. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​shifting the action to the Far East, which should have opened a lot of new paths to the action sequences as well as the history, but not enough of that. Fighting scenes and motorcycle hunting were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts I liked, just like the way the slayer team was not shown as heroic good guys as they were in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I had been hoping since I saw the old Hammer movie Legend Of The Seven Golden Vampires some years ago that somebody one day would make another good Asian based vampire movie. It wasn't.
