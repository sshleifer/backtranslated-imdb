Okay, this movie will never win an oscar. Citizen cane this movie is not ... BUT why should every movie be examined? when was the last time you saw a movie that was fun because it was good but because it was foggy? can no one remember roger corman, the exploit king? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. Just go in not expecting to think and prepare to throw popcorn on the screen.
