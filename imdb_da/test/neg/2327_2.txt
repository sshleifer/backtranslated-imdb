If you don't like bad action, bad editing, ridiculous dialogue and incredible characters, you will hate this movie. If you like all of the above, that is, if you are a Lynch fan, then you will love Mulholland Drive. This is possibly the worst movie to be rated over a 7.0 on IMDB. Outside Naomi Watts work you will be hard pressed to find any competent play in Mulholland. Dr. The other female leader went to "hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops" school to shop. Considering the script they had to work with, it is strange that all the actors did not keep their heads in their hands. The characters wander in and out of the movie, which does nothing to advance the story. You have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, a haughty wife, and her cliche'd pool man lover, a mafioso type figure sitting in a dark room talking through an external box and a host of others for many and boring to mention. Suffice it to say that they manage to do a little more than fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, however, because it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no distinguishing plot. You will wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together, and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a credible way at the end of a movie in a way that leaves every emotion fulfilled. The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create many odd characters and put them in scenes that are not related to the movie as a whole, and then to take the few coherent threads that are and jumble them at the end of the surprise. Guess which way Lynch goes. Surprise! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make sense of it. A dream sequence, after all, covers all sins. Dreams do not have to make sense. Everything can happen in a dream. Editing is also uneven. Let's just say good editing doesn't call attention to itself. Much of the way this movie is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of being aware of editing. "Look at me ... You can see my editing ... Am I not a genius?" Uh, good ... no! This movie has all the earmarks of the worst and most self-indulgent French films. So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is only another sign of the decay of our culture. Songs are hard to compose so let's listen to rap. Plots are hard to follow, so let's dispense with them. Pictures are difficult to paint, so let's throw in a cup and keep a cross in it. These are the symptoms of our times, and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the disorder.
