Dooley and his dog partner, Jerry Lee are together again in this 2nd successor (? !!?) I sincerely had no idea they were making a sequel let alone two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time after Dooley retires, he must mate his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee to poker. Real classic stuff. I mean, come on. The original had at least a couple of good laughs. This one has one. Jim Belushi just looks old and worn out. Both Belushi brothers were great in the 80s. If John wasn't dead, would he be so bad today as his brother? That mindset makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: USA network
