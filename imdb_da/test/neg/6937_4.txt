In a way, I looked like a kind of movie because of a "mindless" positive atmosphere that it conveys. I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but more about that later. First, the characters were a little small and one-dimensional. The "good people" had similar physical and character traits, and the "bad people" had similar physical and characteristic features ... hmmm. The basic story was OK (pretty simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or unfavorable. The main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs - sort of a nice fantasy element to have. However, they had a very minimal presence in the film. <br /> <br /> Besides that, the movie was held at a lively pace and was not elevated in one place. I liked this about the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot had to do with the idea of ​​stealing. I think this movie may not have been well thought out - something is wrong, especially if this is a child's movie. I'll keep the next sentence abstract so as not to be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). The good people do something steal and they don't have the same information the audience has - so it just steals, and it's a little bad for a child's movie. All in all, if you have children, because of a dubious plot aspect I would consider passing. However, this whole movie is pretty low key anyway, so it can't be anything. Disclose this if you have other interesting choices.
