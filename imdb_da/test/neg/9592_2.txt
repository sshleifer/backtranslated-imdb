This movie contains 7.0 rating on IMDb, so even I felt some mess in his synopsis I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80s were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these days were badly done with stupid plot (if they had any), so there are very few who can stand out, and even though they were good, they are still not very good. However, heat suffers from everything that made stupid crimes stupid. It has poor character development, unlikely plot and was not written or directed in a decent way, and when you have such shortcomings, the actet does not help. Stephen Frears often tried to imitate the French New Wave in English style filmmaking, and the two did not match. <br /> <br /> First of all, Terence Stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former partners in crime. He hides in Spain, from all places. He's finally caught up with, and was first kidnapped by a group of stupid Spanish thugs, just drive away a distance to the two hit men who were dealing with him. These two are John Hurt, who was supposed to be hard-boiled, hard coal killer and Tim Roth (in his first role) as the devil's apprentice. They do not kill the stamp immediately, they first deposit the "three Amigos", they should not have hired in the first place, and then they drive stamp to Paris because one of the friends he testified will confront him OK it's possible. But even with the stamp is such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four guys to override him, they do not beat him down, he must not disturb him in any way and run around with him as if he were one of the friends . Stamp does not protest and fortunately goes to Paris to be shot, without spending half a dozen chances, these "professionals" offer for him to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is just a schoolgirl, and makes the idea of ​​a great crime chief working with a hard core man like John Hurt even more unlikely, especially on an important job like that. But since John Hurt is not as hard-core himself, he spends twenty minutes of the film and kills or does not kill the completely-surpassed Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose sole purpose in this movie is to introduce the lovely Laura Del Sol, his mistress ( as he says is 15, but she looks more like 25), and whose role in the story and the actors shows that she was offered the role solely on the basis of being the director's or producer's mistress at that time. Hurt kills Hurt after the Australian, but takes his mistress for no apparent reason. But he will kill her, but Roth, with his "subtle ways," does not convince him so that even she kicks him, bites him and scratches him through the whole movie, he remains true to the deeply buried human side of him. <Br /> <br /> If you have common idiotic scenes like when Hurt and Roth lock the car from outside, are you trying to prevent people from coming out?!?! In any case, the film pulls on. Tim Roth falls asleep, guarding Terence Stamp with his gun on his chest, and Stamp just waiting there to see the waterfall. But the whole stool of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out the window. Let's recap, the whole point of not killing the stamp right away (except having a movie) is to take him to Paris so that his former partner must have a last word with him. And the whole point in him doesn't run away is that he's willing to die and say "It's just a moment. We're here. Then we're not here. We're somewhere else ... maybe. And it's so natural as breathing. Why should we be scared? "But my friends here are where the plot twists, Hurt kills the man while he is still in Spain, and we ask why bother and run around in days he could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and unlike his philosophy Stamp is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why he did not run and he had plenty of chance. Roth is also killed, but he should not be in the movie at all, and Del Sol, she has promised a role in this movie solely for romantic (read sexual) reasons, so that she becomes alive again, even she attacked Hurt for the 15th time in the movie. He killed all the others, but not her, she must have the maximum screen appearance. The film was made on a shoe string budget and it shows, but when you have no history and short-term characterizations, it shows even more. And yes Fernando Ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest star who has a single audible line of dialogue. Terrible
