Horrible Script, apparently directed by ... no one? Marines can't avert the monster with machine guns, but it goes back when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a couple of times. It must be a luxury lining, but the Fancy Dining Room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. It seems that they rented a high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and things to decorate the set with. At the end shot, they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks. How do movies become like this? I think someone can be in a movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
