I only wish there was a class lower than F to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.I do not even classify this as a regular movie but as a T&A movie and this is the worst, lamest, crappiest and most horrible movie i have seen.the acting, story and music is all terrible, not to mention that there is not even a nudity for T&A connisuer.it is about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him making cheers.avoid this piece of garbage any price! This is the worst bad 80-year-old teen movie theater.
