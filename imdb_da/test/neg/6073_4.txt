Yes, I realize half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie "Copying Amadeus," but it cannot be said enough. Scenes appeared to be lifted directly from Milos Forman's script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> -Morestro's arrogant scene ("I'm the voice of God. Everything else is pointless!") <br /> <br /> -Master makes fun of mediocre composer's work (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, as in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> The mediocre composer's dialogue with God ("Why do you put me in music but deny me the ability to compose?") <br /> <br / > -The musical dictation from the deathbed scene ("Common time. Begin with the violins ... cough cough") <br /> <br /> -and the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> The problem is even worse . Not only were these scenes copelessly copied, they were not even done very well. Jeepers, if you are going to tear an original, at least try to improve it in your own creative way. No wait, there's something even worse than that. It is the fact that the director tried to break the story of Mozart into the story of Beethoven. People, Beethoven was not a crass, vulgar slob that this film portrays him. In addition, Beethoven was not a babbling idiot taking pointer from his copy, a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, movies like this are responsible for the slaughter history. <br /> <br /> And another thing Beethoven (in fact) never called it "Moonlight Sonata" as he does in the movie. That name was given by a confused critic some years after being dead, and unfortunately it was fixed. But Beethoven's original title was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND OTHER when Beethoven (in the movie) shouts "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and hit the note on the piano, he hits a white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER DINGGING !!! Beethoven (in fact) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th Symphony. This movie shows him that he hardly has a minor disability (saying "what?" Every other line, just enough to be annoying). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! The American accents ...! Oh nothing against. Just forget it. I've been wasting enough time on this already. Go see "Amadeus" again. So if you want to see an interesting biopic on Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved", which takes poetic freedoms, but at least they are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out "Impromptu", a movie about Chopin. But apart from the three, I have never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
