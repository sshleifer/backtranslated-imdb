I found this movie to be extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know he is gay before he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a slack wrist !!! I was so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival I went up and spoke to the screenwriter to complain about this movie. This is the kind of movie GLAAD has to work to have banned.
