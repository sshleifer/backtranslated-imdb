no really, i can't fool people here and i can't believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! Oh wait, it's the IMDB comments section, silly me. It is interesting to note that on this date there have not been enough votes to give this movie a rating of ten, but there are dozens of comments that rage about the movie. what does it mean i wonder? at least the script is terrible. character changes their personality and motivation and actions each scene to keep the movie running together on something vaguely resembling a pace. It wasn't even stupid behavior, it was there too, but the pure idiot of the script surpassed any stupidity of the signs shown. for example: man is in violation of an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert, and "the killer is here somewhere", so he forces everyone to travel 40kms to find the killer, to obey orders and brush all. When the hero stains something uncomfortable in the dark and warns fellow, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing out there so they all go home. The next scene, he refuses to let it go and has to hunt whatever it is. It's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but the shit that people say about it just tries to cancel its interesting aspects, and predators and alien rip off moments were very boring. and the end ... the end!?!?! jesus .... the worst movie i saw the year and i saw bug buster!
