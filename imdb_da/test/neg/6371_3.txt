I am a fifth grade language art teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), we saw the movie. They laughed aloud! Unfortunately, it's NOT a comedy! The action was so horrible, I felt like I saw a bunch of kids in the neighborhood and put a game. My students mimicked the lines and made fun of and on all the way through. I agree with them, at times it was pretty bad. I still want to show it to the students again, just for fun and comparing the movie with the book. We did a Venn Diagram (teachers know what it is) afterwards to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. I noticed another adaptation being filmed for 2005, so we can only hope the play gets better!
