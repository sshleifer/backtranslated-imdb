"Three" is a serious silly shipwreck movie. Masquerading as a psychological thriller, the closest relative is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also with Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" gave familiar signs to the root in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving parents who are trying to redefine their relationship on a sea cruise. They end up being terrorized by Zane's behavior psycho-killer. It gave sharp, increasingly ratcheted tensions, a frightening sense of claustrophobia in open sea as cat and mouse games in life and death unfolded. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffer from poorly drawn characterization (the audience doesn't worry about what's happening to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot unit, a total lack of excitement or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the main players. Zane especially goes way above the top in an annoying way. In "Dead Calm" he was threatening, wired and sweet with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, petulant slimy and unraveled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how does his lighter remain full of juice for over a year? Ms Brook is very quaint, amazingly beautiful, but both her chest and back appear to have been wildly over-inflated by a kind of liferaft. However, they succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense, she is not. The guy who played the voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third component of this undoing triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, driftwood, by its complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in a meaningful or dynamic way, judges a potential improvement in the molding games. (Undskyldningsord). Plus pages: The landscape is beautiful and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I guess this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went directly to the rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something decent in this direction, get "Dead Calm". It was made by people who knew a little about cinema.
