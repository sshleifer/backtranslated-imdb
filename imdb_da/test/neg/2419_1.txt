If the directors / producers / publishers want to promote a movie "based on actual events" and make a movie that is meant to inspire and have meaning, then in the beginning to maintain any kind of credibility and integrity, you would like to Hold a movie as honest as you possibly can. <br /> <br /> A team wearing "all black" jumpers and making Haka in America is simply stupid. Every half-intelligent person would know that "All Blacks" is the National Rugby Union team in New Zealand, and their jumpers are all black, and Haka is performed by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such stupidity in a movie, without explanation, only reduces the film's credibility to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why"? Why would you do such a stupid thing and for a possible win? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the authors or director or producers have seen it on television before an international Rugby Union match and thought "wow, it would be great in our movie, no one will know that it never happened, they are too stupid to know about NZ and all blacks, it will be great. "How would an American audience respond to a movie made in NZ on Americain grid iron, with a team wearing an American Indian costume and war paint , does a native american indian war dance, run around in circles shouting "oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo" react? They would laugh their heads! <br /> <br /> The people who made this movie and the industry that created it should really have their heads read. For some reason, the industry thinks they can "fool all people all the time". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
