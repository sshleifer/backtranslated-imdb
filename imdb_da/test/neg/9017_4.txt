After an astronaut dies in space, he is returned to a military base. Inside the man, foreign embryos are discovered - he hosts what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of the Giant Leeches" (see separate review), but may be better known for his work at "Columbo". Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better movies than this one ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This movie is cheesy and poorly designed. What is just as interesting is the bad effects, not the film itself. A scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos, and it is an embarrassing cartoon representation. Even for 1958. And then when an adult alien pops up, you'll wonder why he's wearing shoes. Or if you are really inventive, you will wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies. <br /> <br /> By no means is this the worst science fiction movie you will ever see. And you almost have to give it some credit - the alien host who overcomes a military base idea takes place both over the years, both "The Thing" and "Alien". I don't know if these movies were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of time. Apart from that, the movie is flops and is only great for heckling when drinking. I haven't seen the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but it's probably a movie worth for their insults.
