I usually don't consider turning off a movie unless it's really bad. Homegrown is a movie I wish I hadn't even turned on. The reason is interesting, but acting and writing are too low key. I didn't care about the signs. Any movie that has drug use and free naked as highlights is not worth praising. The characters used their time to get high and believe me, this is the only way to sit through this movie.
