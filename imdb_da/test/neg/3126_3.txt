I wish Depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. At least he had solved something. <br /> <br /> The movie struck me as pointless, wandering and very stylish as some other recent French films. Not to knock it. The latest American films are meaningless and wandering and have no style whatsoever. We must be grateful for photography that evokes a European city in the midst of a windy continental winter and for elliptical talks that challenge our ability to understand what's happening. But there can be too much of a good thing. Golubeva is found to stumble around near the sea in the midst of the frozen night, carrying in a bad accent on dreams and such. (There are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You will love it if you are Vlad the Impaler.) Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. I do not know why. Golubeva's young girl also dies, and I don't know why she also dies. She gets beaten in the face, falls to the sidewalk and dies. There is apparently also an explicit sex scene. I have to take their word for it, because even though it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Don't worry about kiddies being shocked. They will probably be asleep at this time. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. As we see him exacerbated by a meticulously beautiful young man - well, but not so good that his nose can't get out of the way - into a lame, murderous and hard physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a beautiful face with huge half-slit eyes and wide cheeks as a doll. Her next movie is to remake Lewton's "I went with a zombie." Then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. I think it's a band. As far as I could do, the band consists of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Any viewer will find the resulting sound interesting, but undeveloped listeners who are proud of "easy listening" cannot enjoy it. If you don't like the music, there is a payoff involved because the vicious composer and leader is hit over the head with Depardieu's stake. <br /> <br /> I have to say I hardly found it worth sitting through. (And it's also a longie.) At times, it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing, while a long-distance freight train slowly arrives, and sometimes stops altogether. I wish it had some jokes.
