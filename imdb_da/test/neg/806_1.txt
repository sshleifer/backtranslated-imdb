who is responsible for these "behind the scenes" things? who are these actors? Did they straddle under stones? "You are lots of yuks!" none. no yuks for me. only disgust and shame that I am a human being. I have to stave off my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. I actually changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with robin william's 'non-stop' i forgot my lithium today rantings, but at least he's fun once in a blue moon. seeing someone who is not funny at all, publishes robin williams, is like having every tooth in his head slow and sadistic, without novokain, forever. <br /> <br /> Stop making these horrible TV movies. Please.
