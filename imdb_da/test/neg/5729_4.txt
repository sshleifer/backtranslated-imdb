"Red Sonja" is defective, weak and lacking. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; The costumes (although Red Sonja's costume is ridiculous. It is ironic that a girl herself afraid of being touched by men because she was raped still chooses to wear so few small clothes even when it rains.) And the music by Ennio Morricone. The film is still a little clear, but definitely not advisable. The story is extremely simple and they didn't even interfere with making it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there were some good action sequences and some humor, both of which are present, but are seriously flawed in many ways. The film takes itself too seriously and tries to impress but fails completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a horrible leading lady. I don't know who accent is worse; Hers or Arnies and on top of it; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters that makes love history incredible. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the biggest villain that seems more bad than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was something good in his role, but my God looked terrible, he changed a lot since his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Perhaps it had something to do with his illness, which claimed his life in 1991? And by the way, what about all the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" actors in this movie? Next to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role, it looked like some sort of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" association. <br /> <br /> The only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword) battles, although some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> Only truly observable to fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
