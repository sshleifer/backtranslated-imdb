The female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also speak as if it is not tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would quickly enter the toilet. How much money do they make on all the people who enter, hoping to be called back to win, $ 100.oo or whatever. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy shares in this money maker ??? Let's face it, with today's technology, thousands of people could call every minute. And with thousands of channels and nothing worth winning, thousands of people are watching this show. "Oh, I know this answer!" Is probably a super common line among the listeners. With these superhotties, constantly saying that the 'lounge needs callers, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often someone who comes through sounds amazed that they actually speak to the host. Many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to move on and score some pocket changes. Wow, the producers just have to rake it. No wonder there are so few advertisements. Advertising is only on to give time for more (mainly losers) to text in and wait, and hope and dream and fantasize about --- what? --- Get enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at Mc .. something? I only look at it now and then on my brothers TV because he likes to see it when he is on the computer. I sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at Mel (one of the most beautiful looking women on TV) and laugh at the scam that is in front of me. Then I have to leave even though I don't! People who have an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation. Mel, get into the movies or TV sitcoms or something. Many of us are pampered with you! Even with the supercu tapes, I am amazed that this show is still on!
