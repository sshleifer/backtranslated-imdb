One of the worst movies I saw in the 90s. I often use it as a benchmark when you watch other movies; "At least it wasn't as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely pointless segments, everyone with the director plays himself - and he's not that interesting. An entire segment of this hypochondriac goes to the doctor. Another who drives him around the country on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen torture. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to Keith Jarrett's "Koln Concert". Encouraged me to go home and rediscover the wonderful album. The best thing to say about the director / actor / egoist is that he has a good taste in music.
