Was there a movie play that was recorded and released as a movie? The formal positioning and stylized drive of a "horror" soap opera for people who do not like horror movies but want to be able to tell the friends that yes, they saw a horror movie. It even contains soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Should books fall from library shelves scare you? Scare the doors scare you? Then this flick is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When you were raped, was it simply ignored because the rapist was the cool kid? What is scary is not this movie, but this filmmaker's view of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the little twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie before who do not want to see one now and who will see another flick about everyone who gathers against the weird child.
