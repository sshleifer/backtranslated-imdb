First of all, the title is "DAILY" an LIE. <br /> <br /> All the "Daily Show" program opens with a visual screen on the date it was created, followed by a pause and the opening announcement. On the many days when they re-run a Daily Show, they release the cue tape and the OMIT date and beginning with the opening announcement gives the false impression that the show is new. It's a lie. There is no mention that it is a retransmission. And that kind of shit is just a tiny indicator of how stealth and fraud this show is. <br /> <br /> It is only 4 nights a week. It's not quite "daily" - which means Monday to Friday - another shortage, but I'm grateful. It is sad to believe that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. This leaves them profoundly ignorant and much worse - poorly misinformed. <br /> <br /> Although it leans liberal-left, politically, this show can be fun at times. However, its truth is low. Facts and information are often wisely twisted to suit the author's agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts go, and fiction and comedy writing begins. The result is exaggerated, reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> The external interviews are highly clever in editing. It really loses me when it bases God and Christians - which it does too often. However, you will never hear anything vague anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and company attack other than Christians, it would be considered an offensive. Names in the credits explain the source.
