I recently downloaded all three Robocop movies into one box set, quite inexpensive, and the only reason I did this was for the special edition of the excellent first. I have seen Robocop 2 before, but not for 17 years, the year it came out. I have never seen it since, because I still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how appalling it really is. It is a complete mess in reality, it has all the signs of a restless production with so many sub-quotes at the same time. It also has a very uneven tone, and it is also one of the nastiest movies I've ever seen. I don't mind a little violence, the first one was incredibly violent, but one is just plain clean. Also SFX is horrible even in 1990, says hello to poor stop exercise. Also having a drug store, curse child as a villain is just a little too much. Peter Weller had, in the slightest sense, not to return to the next. The only positive thing I can say to this movie is that it has a few good gags, thanks for not smoking a kiddie baseball team robber an electric store. To quote the child who plays the villain "It sucks"
