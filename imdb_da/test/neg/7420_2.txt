Developing films based on actual events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and writers. Essentially, you need to reconcile reported testimonies, conflicting sources of information, and Hollywood creativity to producing something the audience can access. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH none of these things seem to take place. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in typical movie noir when a research group collides somewhere in Cascades by plane. Then, the research group disappears, and despite attempts by law enforcement officials and local rescue parties, the failure remains for some time. While one of the passengers goes, infrared images are sprayed onto the screen (a la Predator), which subtly suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fate. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the crash victims. Knowles puts together its own rescue and rescue team with the explicit mission of finding its daughter and the rest of the research team along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash. <br /> <br /> After Knowles' tailor-made rescue team is assembled, the whole movie traverses down uncolored characters, dizzying filmography and a completely unoriginal plot line. I literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it was trying to scare me out of my habits. The only member of the casting who held himself was Henriksen, who did not constitute the lack of depth presented in all the other signs. The transmitted sound effects were also annoying; basically I didn't know if I saw a movie about Bigfoot or grizzly bears. Neither was the plot line so big. It was too underdeveloped, as the viewer was primarily exposed to typically scary music found in something similar genre. Of course, you didn't have to be a genius to find out who would pull all their clothes in the middle of the movie, or who would be the first unfortunate soul beaten by Mr. Sasquatch. As for good points, there are none, and so I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.
