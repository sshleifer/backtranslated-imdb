There is something rotten about this movie, and basically the way it becomes an eerie and twisted character in a hero by exploiting our sympathy with his admittedly awful situation. Sampedro, which many have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been considering it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse, but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks, even if it means ending a life, is, in my opinion, deeply wrong . What a contrast to the uplifting example of scientist Stephen Hawkings that was far worse for much longer! Yet with the morale on the head, the film reels in hero worship, and the people who disagree are painted in simplistic idiotic terms. There is little room for subtly special in the meeting with the priest (deliberately manipulating the real life meeting that was with a much younger priest). In this way, I assume that the film is on an equal footing with Riefenstahl's Triumph of Will. The insidious idea is that everyone should have the right to take their life when they feel they cannot live it anymore. It makes no difference whether you are physically or mentally damaged, who are obviously people who believe you have the right to choose. The same people are likely to make an abortion case. Its all parts of the current tendency to get the disorder or sick out of sight, brush it under the carpet, mammo will say it. Ok, and we all feel very happy about ourselves. So we go down the slippery road to believe that some live, is just not worth living, and then we decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves, we bring the state to decide for them. Enter Adolf Hitler right from the second Oscar candidate "there Untergang". Of course, Hitler believes that he does exactly what Nature does in the disposal of the weak. During his regime, abortions were forced among the "weaker" tribes, the mentally handicapped became silent and the Jews were "humanly" liquidated by using gas. He would have applauded this movie and why not it is in line with his philosophy ... "some lives are just not worth living." I distinguish myself from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler, and all the people involved in making this movie. Human life is sacred, it is not true, it is a gift and a commitment. No one chooses to be born, who can choose death. It's not about religion, it's about protecting the weak and helpless, something this movie does a lot to undermine!
