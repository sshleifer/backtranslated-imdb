Recap: Since the Warrior Queen Gedren traveled and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. Now Gedren has taken a very strong talisman who threatens to destroy the world if it is not destroyed and kills Sonja's sister in the process. Now, Sonja is out of revenge and to save the world. Along the way she meets the very Conan-like (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the child prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first, Sonja throws off all the help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world. Comments: When you watch a movie like this, and you think it's the story that it's the best item in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this must draw its strength on good swordbirds and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It is simple and straightforward and offers really nothing in terms of character development or even excitement. It's predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry at all. And the baby is just annoying. And most scenes are pulled out so long that they get boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And then back to point 1). The battles are slow, unimportant and really bad. It clearly shows that most warriors clearly block the opponents' lines far in front of the opponent, even starting to strike. In my honest opinion, I think most children, struggling with sticks, create more exciting battles that play knights than this movie did. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off, which should be avoided by anyone who liked the Conan movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
