One of the movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end. There was just something about the movie that made me zone out. I think because I look back and think "yep still in that tree ... still looking at the water". Poor character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I voted for the hook. I found it hard to believe that a hook would try to tip a boat in the first place and so when it jumps into the boat, I also find it unlikely. The croc seems to be too supernatural at times ('everyone knows everything to see'). Even when the croc attacks are behavior, it seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and will not let victims drop twice to three times in a row, especially when they are attacking in the water.
