Best around the middle when most characters get horny and go for someone they haven't had before. It's about this point that we'll see Susan Sarandons majestic breasts (though through a veil). Oddly enough, Beverly D'Angelo, who is not shy about nudity, does not show anything at all while Aida Turturro? of all people ?? do. At the other end of the spectrum, the less about Walken playing a gay, the better. The movie itself has little plot; The dialogues from the theater play and the "normal" dialogues often cross, and that is not the kind of thing I want to consider a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Occasionally, the dialogue has something to do with it, but the film draws on stretches.
