From Andy Warhol's depictions in the movies In Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I would predict that Andy Warhol could do - airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot, which is sometimes incredibly incredible, is compensated by the film's pane and real film. The film has a way of being unreal, yet dictates the reality to the viewer. The only valuable part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and everything in it must be seen as a characterization unit. There are a couple of comic scenes that I admit are fun, but Trash is really just a character study about loosening people who are mildly comfortable if you don't mind seeing nudity and i.v. drug use.
