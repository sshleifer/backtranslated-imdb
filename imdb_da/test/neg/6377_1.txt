Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly runs conservatism and all Republican. This liberal cartoon is anything but that, when he throws his cut "humor" into the throat of impressionable youth. I've seen the show while you're stuck in a waiting room while my car was being repaired and this guy is bordering on treason. He takes Al Queda's side over Bush every day. He is shameless and all he says is drawn by a false lattice. I remember four years ago when he interviewed John Kerry. The two faced each other, which seemed to exclude a makeout session. It was like "Get a room, you". I just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda. Call me low. The Daily Show has had a long time, and there are many like-minded liberals who have a sweet hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised at its success, but do many people actually see Comedy Central? The Mancia guy makes me barf.
