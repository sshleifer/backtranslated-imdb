This movie has to go down in the story of bad movies as the worst I've ever seen. It wasn't even a bad B movie ... I would have rated it as a z. The special effects were ridiculous ... wrong if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer before hit the nail on his head ... it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was great and the synopsis exciting (both of which are why I rented it) it was a waste of not only time but also money . I didn't last long. I took it back to the store and switched it to another movie, I think my local video store took it off the shelf because they had many good complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job filming the / write the script!
