There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a couple of signs were fleshed out and not so good. There were plot holes large enough to drive a truck through. The pace creeps together like an old man. There were many moments that the film never came back to like Coco stripping. What happened to her? What about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing about him. What about the electronic piano guy? What about the rich girl who got abortion? What happened to her? It was an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was in this movie. Let's make the time come through !!!!!!!
