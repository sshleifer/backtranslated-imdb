This movie is so bad. but it is so bad that I laughed my ass out. For people who like movies, don't look at this. For people who like movies well and badly, I recommend this one. The story lines shaken, the script is terrible, the play is terrible to mediocre. the soundtrack in the whole movie was corny, but i loved it. the fat catch phrases were a plus tho. ha ha. "If it can soften it can die". the battle scenes blew me up. It seemed to me that they spent more time on these parts than any other cuz battle scenes were mostly clean. I almost feel that this movie could have been good if it wasn't too f / x .... no it would still have been a crapshoot. the eye was corny. and how the chicken ate the belly's stomach in the kitchen, they could do something where shed actually eat something or at least put more of the false blood on her face. and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me. I thought they could have got real fire instead of crappy computer synthesized stuff. and the end was so predictable, which surprised me as they actually did what I did even though they could. so overall. id say this is a classic as far as crappy movies go. it's in my bottom 5.
