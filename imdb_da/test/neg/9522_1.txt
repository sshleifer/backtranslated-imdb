I am a little spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound like they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of inside information that you probably could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews, as it would just be too boring to consider. <br /> <br /> Afraid I'm another of those who hated the movie and was surprised by its inappropriate amateurism. Good idea, shame on the performance. And it was most disturbing to see so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones, including lead lead), everyone thought they were in a lot of very different movies. <br /> <br /> I wish the AKA had been audacious, innovative or simply simply interesting. Unfortunately, it was like seeing an unintended hysterical home video with artificial ambitions. A missed opportunity.
