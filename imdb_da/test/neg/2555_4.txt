I couldn't stand the woman who played the mother. I wanted her to stop. She had a bizarre way of talking, and the lines she got to read didn't make it any better. I had no idea why the city's citizens were so busy with her to cause all these problems, except that in a town populated by men, she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. Even after a terrible tragedy, the voice was without human feeling, she didn't seem to have any ability to understand the events of her life. She delivered her lines with the same feelings, if she said "I love you," "I hate you," "the bank is foreclosure," "my dress is on fire". Was this actually filmed in Ireland? The sun fluttered throughout the film and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the fall. I lived in Ireland in the summer of 2002, the wettest summer of a century. Most were still harvested. If the farmers in Ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches, the country would have sung hundreds of years ago. It looks like there was not much money to make the movie. The black and white flashbacks looked like they were filmed with the security cameras you can get at Sam's Club.
