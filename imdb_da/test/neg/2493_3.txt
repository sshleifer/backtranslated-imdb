I saw this year on television when I was sick (I don't know, I usually am more complacent with my TV viewing when I'm sick, too much effort to use the remote I think). <Br /> <br /> From what I can remember, all aspects of the movie - casting, acting, writing, directing, etc., I could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if that movie had created a sense of how it was work at Trinity; but it didn't. There were attempts to humanize the researchers, but they were insufficient and never exceeded caricature. <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project at the time, but the depictions in the movie were so cartoon-like that I became interested in learning about the real personalities. And I did. So I suppose this horrible movie has made a very small amount good. It's not a thorough review, but FMLB doesn't deserve either. You like it if you're a fan of bad movies.
