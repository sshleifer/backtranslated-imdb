Why Lori Petty was thrown as a maid, I never know. Her appearance is lacking in gloss. Her voice is lattice. It's almost impossible for me to put words into how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several "modern pop" references in the movie that I found to be very strange as the film was supposed to take place far in the future. It would not have been difficult to make this assumption interesting either. Something better to write would have helped lots. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts looks like it's a mild mannered techno-geek. I think they should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a petty fan. Don't try to watch this movie. Total waste of time.
