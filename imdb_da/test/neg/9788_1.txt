Being a former MST3k watcher, I even found this movie unmatched. The horrible attempts at humor-picking the terrible attempts to act. No one needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they go through all the modern vampires. Give me a few bucks and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent pieces of film production I've ever seen, and that says something. Look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
