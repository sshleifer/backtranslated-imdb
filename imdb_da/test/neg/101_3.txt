I gave this a 3 out of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> Unless you like to waste your time watching an anorexic actress, it is Carly Pope who behaves like a ditz, not bother. /> <br /> Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student who is fascinated with a game of puzzles that lead her down the subway underground - a dangerous thing for even a well-versed man to enter alone. <br /> <br /> There are various intrigues in the movie - a weirdo classmate who apparently stalks Sara, a cynical shop owner who runs a kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall business that appears to be located in a ghetto's back street, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named Emily Gray who is back in jail. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a lawyer who handles Emily Gray's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was placed in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some heady reasons, they released her again, although it is clear, she is still dangerously distorted. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily has ever given to her crime is: I never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, never expect to get any better explanation than that because you don't want to.
