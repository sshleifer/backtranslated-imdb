You belong to me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen crew and it was a lending movie to Fonda for Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to get the Tom Joad part in Wrath's Grapes. But after that, it was usually his lending movie that was good while being thrown into mediocre stuff on Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule was broken here. Although the character he plays plays a superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film is not nearly as fun anywhere. In fact, feminists will probably be horrified at it. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck wasn't happy about it. She liked to work with Henry Fonda enough, but thought that this movie was ridiculous. As good as she should have. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy whom we would now call a trust fund baby who doesn't really do much with his life. He is a kind of lovable lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show up. Turns out she is a doctor and they have a whirlwind and married. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that Fonda has a jealous strike, especially when it comes to Roger Clark, another millionaire patient of Stanwycks. And he doesn't understand her professional obligations. Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he should go to work and live on a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda goes out and gets work as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that she will actually give up her medical practice and live with him on his seller's salary. Today, NOW would be on the picketing movie. Stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance, probably because she did not believe in any of it. I certainly couldn't. <br /> <br /> I don't think even then when the audience thought it either. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but this one was a Thanksgiving special.
