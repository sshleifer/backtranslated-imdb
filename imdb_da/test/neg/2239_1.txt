Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it. <br /> <br /> As usual, the pure sadistic screen can be explained as a clever thought-provoking way to send violence back to the audience's face. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is worth wading in it to do so. How much brilliant. <br /> <br /> The young part of the audience may not be smart enough to follow all the clever references to higher levels of consciousness, but I am convinced that they will see the light one day. <br /> <br /> Thank you for making this little world of ours a little better. You deserve a medal.
