One of Boll's better attempts. Just show that if you do something long enough, you have to improve by chance. It's still not good, but at least it is watchable, which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the game's strong point, while Bloodrayne had a strong story, and so Boll had a better chance of destroying it. The action in this movie is actually pretty good. Occasionally a touch exaggerated, but in a good way and worth seeing just for it. <br /> <br /> It was wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good, but you can tell that they don't take it seriously from comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the movie actually helps. <br /> <br /> While I seem to be a little closer to the story of the game perhaps for a slightly better movie, the changes made are quite practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially considering the plot of the game was hardly Oscar to win only one vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked to see it in the jungle as it was a fairly integral part of the game, but Canada doesn't have much of the jungle, and it is at least placed in a kind of rainforest. Why Boll feels like changing professionally scripted and directed games plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations, it always lacks. Watch the movie for a laugh, if it's good for it and maybe to watch a party like a drink food.
