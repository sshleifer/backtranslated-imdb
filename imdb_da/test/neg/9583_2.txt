It seems to be a rather innocent choice first - the name "employee of the month" can call bells with "Office Space" and the show "Office Clerk." I do not think. This is not even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, anyone's name, was a complete jerk and has a sick, perverted mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into being a complete loser who cheats on his wife, stealing from his top-notch job and lying through his teeth 24/7. The other thing I go into the room when my family looks at it (and believe me, they only looked at it because they asked that at least there be some relief, maybe even some fable in the end, send a warm message of good justice done and when the good looks good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they didn't have the time to look good. No memorial was made. <br /> <br /> This movie has borderline insanity. It respects the elderly, the dead and the women - and the director tries to get people to like it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie only two because the soundtrack was good. But not even that was all memorable. If you were lucky enough not to see this in theaters, definitaly my friends - don't make it home.
