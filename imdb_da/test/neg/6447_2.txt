I rated this better than terrible because I liked to see Jonathon from Buffy in something again - even though it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is sweet to a card, but not a whole movie. Scripture was forced and constructed. I have a feeling that the movie has suffered most during editing. <br /> <br /> Second, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes crossed - even when she doesn't try to do so. She's just not fun. She always plays a kind of misfit girl who wins by being herself - ironically, as Amanda seems to always be a caricature. I actually want to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always thrown into these trite roles where she angles and makes faces and somehow good? <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I am a Dork" segment was ripped off by the North Revenge. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
