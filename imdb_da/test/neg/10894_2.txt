This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, which ends up being disturbed by a psycho on a deserted stop. In fact, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), as her boyfriend literally disappears within minutes. The movie goes extremely fast, and in the beginning you wonder how it might stretch its history to length. It's not long before you realize that the movie does it by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere. The story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid and incoherent. Minutes after disappearing her boyfriend and car, Nicole finds a mobile home in the rest of the stop. She sees the flashing of a camera and KNOWS that people are inside, but she easily stops trying to get their help when no one answers her door knob. After being informed by the murderer that her boyfriend is in danger, she goes around the rest and does all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. This also includes turning on a TV (and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbling on a porn movie, even in this grim situation), sitting around, wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours. She does all this KNOW that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still loose and stalking her and without taking any action to ensure her immediate security (she doesn't care to lock the doors or stay alert). Oh yeah, she's trying to use a radio to call for help, but why even disturb when there's a mobile home with people inside the RIGHT THERE in the rest stop? The scriptwriter seems to have forgotten this important fact while writing this part of the story. There is no sense of entrapment or perpetual danger in this story. The heroine walks freely in and around the various buildings in the resting state, and the killer runs only occasionally to scare her before they leave again. There is nothing to stop Nicole from just leaving (although the rest stops are far from anywhere else, it's better than sitting), but she chooses to stay whatever. At some point in the film, the protagonist himself recognizes that she can run away, but it doesn't. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't go anywhere, and just jump from pointless segment to pointless segment. Nicole finally enters the mobile home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of protected, presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics. They intentionally ignorant or scary about the murderer's actions (but there are no signs that they are associated with him in any way), and then Nicole kicks out after several minutes. In the next irrelevant segment, the protagonist walks into the bathroom building. She discovers one of the murderers' former victims (a young woman named Tracy) who is still living and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy begins to throw ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes out to pick up a club to pry open the cabinet door, and when she returns a moment later, both Tracy and her blood are gone without any explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board with many missing people and sees that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. So was Tracy a ghost or something? The author never has trouble explaining. <br /> <br /> Then, a politician in the middle of the night is shown to male police officers at rest who were comfortably left unattended for the whole day. Nicole tells him everything that has happened, and when the killer goes up in his truck outside the office, the police go outside to confront him. What does the police officer do by knowing that something is seriously wrong? He goes up and talks quietly to the killer (who Nicole herself had pointed out to be the guy who stalked her) and buys into the murderer's lie that he simply ran through and needed directions. Seriously. The politician then speaks to Nicole outside, totally ignorant, as the pickup truck turns and drives him over. <br /> <br /> The police quickly tell Nicole that he is a goner who is "lucky to breathe" yet, but he strangely does not die for a while. The two of them make something more meaningless to speak, and the all important fact that he has a gun is annoying not even mentioned for a long time. When the two of them finally try to use the gun, Nicole stupidly wastes most of his bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was behind it. With two balls left, the policeman tells Nicole to use one to euthanize him. She burns one in her mouth and he lies for a moment, with a piece blown out of his head. Then he shouts suddenly and inexplicably "You Missed!" and she has to shoot him again. Quite cheap attempt at shock. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nicole confronts the killer and fails. The film ends with a scene that does not take long since a woman arrives at the now strangely more active rest stop. In the bathroom building she hears Nicole crying for help in the closet (locked as Tracy was). She makes a policeman go in and check it, but he finds a seemingly normal and clean closet. The police are leaving, he thinks he has been deceived. A battered Nicole is seen behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily discovered if the policeman had spent all 10 seconds looking for), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This movie is apparently the first in a new series of "quality" direct-to-DVD movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters. In fact, it's just more clich√©, B-Movie waste.
