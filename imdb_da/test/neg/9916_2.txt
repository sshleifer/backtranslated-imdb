I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs of it - dialogue that should happen well before big f / x scenes (to introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier, is stuck in recent times - line, perhaps the original script for a long time, but perhaps not - at least this series. Each character is uninteresting, and * all * speaks exhibition passages as if they are speaking the word of God, signs that are completely exposed - Dianne Wiests The "Secretary Abbot" is just awful, explaining things to his assistant (and, moreover, to us) in endless speeches that no one will ever say to anyone in real life (when she is not explaining things to her assistant as she already knows her assistant explains things to her as she already knows, there are signs that are completely one-dimensional - the evil power company guy, the pilot who just won't stop his personal life and concentrate on his job. power company superdooperuber hacker guy, that can collapse <br /> <br /> * all * in Chicago (including the phones) - and then oh-no-what-have-I-talk (but not be a back door?). The corresponding reporter who surrenders his principles to the fall of a hat? The power company shift monitoring, which surpasses its position in the middle of the worst crisis in Chicago since the fire - without consequences? Hospitals LIMITED by Doctors and Nurses During the Crisis (I'm Not Fun, It's In The Movie.) Oh yeah, and it's filled with Hollywood moral cliches - generally, women are good, men are evil unless it is influenced by a woman (the ultimate is punk with the gun - deprived of a woman's influence, he becomes literally insane); An evil stupid act (as did the reporter with hacker-bozo) is okay as long as you mean well. The evil men die, capitalist evil men die as cruelly as possible, everyone else lives (well except Randy Quaid). And I heard someone say that the nuclear power plants should shut down because there was no electricity to run the safety systems (think of it)? <br /> <br /> There is a sunbeam (if you apologize for the phrase) - Randy Quaid basically plays his character from "Independence Day" (you know - "Hey boys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as a storm hunter with infinite range of SUVs and superdopes batteries for their camcorders. Nevertheless, they kill him - for the most part, the audience seems to appreciate that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (pretty low, so.) Give this a passport.
