Warren's Inseminoid), some "bad" movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies trying to make it postmodern by being deliberately bad should always be contacted with extreme caution. Many believe that Troma's Terror Firms is a marbleist masterpiece, for example, but I guess someone over fifty will push it out as a worthless killer. Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star.
