At times, when I watch this movie, I begin to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs. What's wrong with this movie, I'll tell you Bad Plot, Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters are all just bad. br /> <br /> The movie is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit scam hustler that gets the chance for $ 50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living. So now Pest needs to think of ways to think this hunter before he gets killed. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking "What the hell is this?" Another wannabe Ace Ventura is trying to make money really this plot is just boring and confusing sometimes it changes the story plot and you are lost during the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the fun scenes, I had a movie just face oh yes I smiled a few times but nothing laughed out loud. Moreover, the jokes are grainy and seen before it is like seeing that Ace Ventura meets Dum and Dumber but poor. <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, it is dry and flat. You do not learn much about the protagonist Pest everything you know is that he is an annoying scam, but that is what he does not change his picture or be a little smart just corny.as for the German hunter all you are he is crazy and want to go back to Germany. You really start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if there is money to travel to Germany. The hunter's son Himmel goes better, but not much. He is really a fig and is snaked for reasons at the end he stands up to his father and sides with pests. <br /> <br /> Regarding the actor no nly, there was some memorable perforation but just above the top. who plays the hunter the same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well. Besides, it's just not used enough or just above the top. <br /> <br /> Extremely bad comedy that you'll find for $ 2.00 at K-Mart.
