Intelligent summary, isn't it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong, even a kind of movie, they became quite up to it with their successor, The Road Warrior. So in theory with a third big movie it would have been a great trilogy ... now it's not! Such a big disappointment over the Thunderdome was! The main premise is pretty cool, with a "underworld" (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it's not all done with too much conviction. Add the unpleasant Tina Turner and people's no good storyline waiting for an airplane, and it's just a big stinker. Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (though one will just be a big budget-explosion kind of thing) because it just isn't right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
