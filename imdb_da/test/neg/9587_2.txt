... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) where none of the characters are sympathetic or even interesting people? I can see what the author David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad taste surprises he put into "One Foot in the Grave" etc. I admit that the script did a bit more of an effort than most on British television in the moment. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold drilling. Another poster mentioned the scene where the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her late ex-boyfriend shagging. It was the moment when I turned off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that the posters, who did not like this series, are all British, while those who praise it are mainly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series, it was ignored by the viewers and sank like a rock. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! There will be another series in the fall of 2007 - but without the male management. It sounds like the BBC has decided to turn it into a more conventional 30-minute sitcom.
