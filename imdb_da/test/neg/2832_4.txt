As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and the majority of the movies he has been involved in, I guessed I would enjoy offspring. I didn't do that, although in some ways it is moments. But if you expect some of the community or Beyond ReAnimator's caliber, you might be in a shock. In a way, this resembles society, which is a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a terrible supernatural underbelly ... but this is where it ends. I do not cover for Yuzna when I say that the bug is not really with him, because poor direction is poor direction, but the direction is sound. What raises the movie is both script and play. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written an intelligent script but one that does not really work with the Yuzna style and lets him pause actors who provide long dialogue when he really wants to throw the camera around and come down with his bad self . This case makes the movie awkward enough as it is, but it is worse. <br /> <br /> If the movie was made with great actors, the movie would probably have kept its own. Unfortunately, this is very far from the case. The action is wood, shocking, so even for a low budget B function. The inexplicable, successful and famous Arnold Vosloo destroys every damn line with exact precision and delivers one of the worst performances I've seen for a long time. The man manages to turn any line of deliberate dialogue into the kind of ham line you want to throw drunkenly with helpers the next time you are in the pub. Hey Bob! GOD GOD, I GO FOOD! WHAT IS ... COME ABOUT ME! NOOOO! ' In fact, I can try the one myself next weekend. The last minute addition of the genre veteran (and personal favorite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the movie as it should, seems almost to give the Dourif movie in a final ditch to stop Vosloo from hamming, but frankly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable Waiting for the next attack of bad acting beside Vosloo, and even an eccentric ride from him fails to revive the movie. <br /> <br /> If the play was better, this movie would be okay. Hell, it could have been quite enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and causes the horror element to appear dressed and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film. I found alien torture / rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already, but the fact that the signs were so lacking made them work free as well as unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> So, if you really like sci-fi and don't have a bad play, pedestrian pacing and a real garish, nasty rape scene, offspring will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do, I'll probably never see it again. Once was enough. On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi movie that Yuzna has ever bothered to do, so he was not so happy about it himself.
