This review is for UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc One is called Trapped in the Law and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc Two is called Bedroom Fantasies and includes Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, she is the manager and your legal person. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is enough space on the discs for much more material. <br /> <br /> Each episode opens with hotel Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading A letter from a satisfied customer. We then see the story unfold as guests check into the hotel. The Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. The authors need to get credit to come up with a good selection of stories. For example, Model Behavior is about two models fighting for the attention of the photo collection; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who separate and re-educate their love when they meet again at the hotel; She is the boss is about a male secretary / dog child who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realized - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead to lots of nudity and sex. It should not come as any surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and beautiful hunks. Even the geeky secretaries are transformed when they remove their glasses and let their hair down. The sex act is abundant, but for me it seems scary and false. The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and then moving to catch everything, and as usual we get loud music during sex action. Finally, the final credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although my Florida map does not show any Singer Island. The landscape certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas, as some people have mentioned. It's a pretty good bet and it's a pity that the second series is still awaiting a British DVD release. 4 stars.
