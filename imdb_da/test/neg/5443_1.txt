As an avid movie maker, I felt that while I was placing my favorite movies, I just felt it was fair to rank my most hated movies. I'm afraid I really don't have anything positive to say about this movie. It's actually one of only two movies I've ever gone on. In fairness I went back and watched the movie again to give it a try and sat through only to wish I had been gone. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the movie has a really decent cast and crew ... but then even the sharpest stars in Hollywood can't bring a dead duck of a script to life. Stay away ... Save yourself from this really boring movie 1/10
