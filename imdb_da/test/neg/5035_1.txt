This horrible piece of tripe was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story involving two family members (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). This movie is offensive; Besides the fact that it was not a particularly good movie anyway, it is by no means caught up with what it was to lose such a close family member and completely exclude those who were really hit by the tragedy of true life. <br /> <br /> As far as the director is concerned; he managed to deposit a family's accident for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could have given this a zero, I would have. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
