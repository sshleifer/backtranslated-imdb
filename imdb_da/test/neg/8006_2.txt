<br /> <br /> I was intrigued by reading the spectrum of opinions about `Circus' from` fantastic, breathtaking, brilliant 'and most things right down to `Golden Turkey candidate'. I find myself in the latter camp. The producers, of course, believed that if they mixed lots of over-the-top violence with four-letter barrage, they would have another `lock, Stock and two smoke barrels' on their hands. Too bad they forgot to include humor, style, charm and flair. And it was definitely a mistake to visit Welles' classic 'The Lady from Shanghai' and thus serve to remind us how much better the cinema can be. <br /> <br /> John Hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity, a great American driving around in a mini-minor like "Circus" pathetic tribes for cult status and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe can't add any class to these procedures . <br /> <br /> To see a good Brit movie try the sublime `Wonderland '
