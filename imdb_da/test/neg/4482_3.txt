Today, as the President's day, my wife and I had "The Notebook" DVD, checked out at our local library. It is a movie released in 2004 that fell under our radar as we are big filmmakers. I am a published author with hope of screen playing my first book. I had noticed references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other movies, why I brought it up about us to see and this morning gave the perfect opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; We could relate to many things in it with our own continued love affair, and even though I struggled to suffocate. <br /> <br /> In the afternoon after many duties, work and dining, we decided to actually catch an afternoon. When we got to the theater, we had seen most of the current party movie that played, we chose to see "Victoria Day", which for some reason was not in the theater, although both IMDb and my phone films showed that it was playing there. So instead we looked at the poster for "Dear John" and that it was written by the same author as "The Notebook", making it the obvious choice since we have had so much 'TN'. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sense of empathy as 'TN'; and we continued to comment in all similarities - two dozen or so - promptly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" It had a real 'cash cow' feel, which means that Sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact template of 'TN' to just make a quick buck. Not only that, after the "bug-eyed" troll unlikely 'Dear John's-John' to the wimp cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with every passing soap stupid line all the way to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this hour. 16.45 Monday matin√©e and my wife even told me to keep it down so I wouldn't spoil it for the others ... it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and Sparks blatantly, inexpensive attempts at template writing painfully obvious. We just want us to have seen "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it might have been to see this bad access to the cinema. And oh ... in the last 30 minutes I kept saying "... don't give this cow the coins ... don't give this cow the coins?"
