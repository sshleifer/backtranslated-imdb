The movie was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses felt "flat" and basically there was no development of the characters in history. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps blames with a sour face all the time, pouting and basically looking annoyed by everyone. The Danes have no magic magic, and Ribissi's character is a goober that no one would want to hang out with, even though they were paid to do so. <br /> <br /> Throw in the weird scene where Epps is going to dance with an old man and you might have anything that could be the worst movie in the movie story. I saw it on satellite (thank goodness, I didn't pay it) and wished I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take the variety of underwear and socks if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when / if it comes on your TV . Awful movie if you ask me and I generally have something good to say about almost any movie out there.
