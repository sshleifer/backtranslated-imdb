In my opinion, this movie is not good. I hardly find a good thing to say about it, but I'd like to explain it before I conclude, it's just another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to see it because Costas Mandylor stared at it and that was the main reason I saw it at the end. I like action movies and I understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story. I know they don't go into details about the credibility of the story and the events, but even that doesn't explain why some scenes, just because they lack reality, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Initially, the film looks really promising: A hard and handsome specialist and his not so hard but smart and fun partner must do a job that turns out a little different than they had expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. There is a catastrophe, the ship is reversed and only a few are detained. During their struggle to survive, they must escape a shark, a professional killer, and the rising water. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie is quite violent. The main weapon (besides the disaster already taking out most passengers) is the gun, which is successfully used in many cases. I have personally missed a good man to man (or woman to woman, if you prefer) to fight. Family fun? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie was shot in a hurry, without a real vision, what it is trying to say. Made from the usual action movie tricks, with a bit of something called love, and without a real meaning, it just results in a bad movie.
