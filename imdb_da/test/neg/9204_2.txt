A space ship in an unspecified future where people are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash landing on a strange young planet where the dinosaurs also randomly evolved, and only in this world are they not extinct ... yet. The survivors of the crash, about ten gentle characters, wearing blue, white and yellow suits, are fighting for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Dinosaurs planet" is a peculiar movie. As I said in my summary above, stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the movie are the only colorful actors. The models are raw but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and exciting than these characters depicted by inexperienced actors and talking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single review. It was clear that most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there is not enough to save us from our boredom. These human figures are only there to scream, run around, and mumble these poorly written and verbal speeches on survival. And unfortunately not nearly enough of them are eaten by the dinosaurs. Overall, "Dinosaurs Planet" is not a movie I plan to see again. Some people will simply love it to be so cheap and so badly made. Sometimes I like movies like this one. But this film is just too long, too boring and very exhausting on the mind.
