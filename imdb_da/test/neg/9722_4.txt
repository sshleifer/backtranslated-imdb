The TV ads for this movie showed that warlocks hit a truck upside down and then smashed to bits and reforms on the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the general style of the movie was wimpy. This is the "Charmed" TV series with three boys instead of three girls. The big surprise for the three teenagers being grown up is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power. In addition to driving in trucks, these children can fly up the sides of the house, climb out of windows, push each other into stacks of garbage and cause the veins in the neck to jump out. But if they use their powers too often, they become premature and weak. The father of one of the boys is proof of this when he sits on a ceiling that looks like a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good warlocks are each dirty rich in their own right, totally spoiled, unpleasant and annoying. In any public school, these children would be turned up every day. Their glares and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the boys from the cap. Unfortunately for all good people, these Charmed boys were sent to Hogwarts Reform School for warlocks who could not enter Harry Potter's class. <br /> <br /> So what was the movie about? Three teenagers appear with each other and their girlfriends. Another teen who envies their power and money and happens to be a lost family. After a few scenes where the Charmed boys show their powers and have sex with their girlfriends the movie comes around to the unknown warlock teen's revenge plot. The predictable things happen. The bad warrior bar prevents different friends from the other warlocks and also begins to attack them. The final confrontation happens and it's about it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you like to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then it's a good movie to watch.
