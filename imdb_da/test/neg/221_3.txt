I'm so angry at the point I usually make reviews with spoilers, but in this case I will make an exception. The first scenes in these movies are weak and so when they come to the movie's meat and potatoes it sucks. This is a movie I was rooted for the evil, because the captain-save-the-day was incredible, and there was no connection with him or nothing to make you like him. The main actor gave the weakest performance, and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even save this movie. Sometimes there are eye-openers or big moments in a movie that may not be so big .. this movie has no one. If you're looking for a movie to watch in the meantime, while nothing looked your interest ... don't choose this .. save your money.
