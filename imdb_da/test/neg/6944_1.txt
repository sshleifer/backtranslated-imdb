This is by far the most worst movie I've seen this year from Bollywood so far. I must not lie, my wife liked this movie a lot. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal that made this movie incredible, but it was Amisha Patel. She performs the role of a blind woman who comes into trouble when she almost falls from a mountain where the hero Arjun Rampal comes to save her (in the middle of heaven). It surprises me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is falling from a mountain because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I started to watch the movie very close and in each scene there was a mistake in Amisha Patel's play. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does it is to look at the eyes of the person she is talking to. When I watched this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with her performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level of acting as an actress. <br/> In any case, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's the clich√© story. Suddenly, Arjun is killed by a man who is crazy in love with Amisha. Amisha is desperate, but then Bobby goes into the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor in my view, but he can't pull the movie to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep into the ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he has so far. Bobby grew from acting from the first movie his lovely father gave him. He was so bad at trading in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get tremors and believe in every word he says. Only a movie with great potential as a Yash Copra movie must meet. <br /> <br /> Okay, when Amisha falls in love with Bobby, some come to life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who does this crap think? I dont do that. Why didn't they give their role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a scream for an actor like Bobby to give him a big role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen tsv face) Patel. This movie was so horrible that I regret buying it.
