As I write this in November 2005, I have come to realize that the great British boom boom has ended, and while people will argue much of this, it is not the UK government that does not give film producers tax crimes. I think the reason is much simpler - Lack of diversity among manufacturers over the last few years. Let's look at what the British produced in 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Funky gangster thrillers. LOCK STOCK AND TO SMOKING BARRALES was a great and thoroughly entertaining movie, and people went out of their way to monkey Guy Ritchie's style with normally disappointing results <br /> <br /> Romantic Comedies. Yes okay, I realize FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, etc. Were produced by American studios, but they are still vague "British movies". Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to make money for studios, they must follow a winning formula that normally involved Hugh Grant to play Hugh Grant for the sixty-five <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy really is? In the British context, it is usually a wandering movie with often simultaneous political statements that often resemble Mike Leigh's NAKED <br /> <br /> Jasmin Disdar's BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British film. Filmed in 1999 but canceled in 1993, it opens with two men who have a fight on a bus, and it is later revealed that you are Serbian, and you are a Croat, so we get a little cover on what happened in the Balkans that time, though, what are the odds of two previous enemies in the Balkans bumping into each other on a London bus? This sums up one of the big mistakes in the movie - Irony takes precedence over probable situations you can appreciate the final irony of the sub-plates, but is the result likely? Perhaps the biggest irony is the title of the movie. It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but certainly this audience found them clich√© stereotypical people I couldn't believe as three-dimensional characters
