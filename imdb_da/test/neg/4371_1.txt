Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad plays, bad characters, annoying clowns, bad lines, you are called. Honestly, I'm not so surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. The only reason I saw Killjoy 2 is because I would think the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. They didn't. This movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. The clown .... the stupid clown .... I hate him! I hate him so much! And I don't hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's annoyed convinced! I hope the filmmakers understood after trying and failed again that this movie cannot be repeated. The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3.
