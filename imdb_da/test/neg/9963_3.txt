I work on my way through Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the set. I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was only the second movie I saw him, the first was DEAD MEN WALK, where he played two parts. But even good acting could not save MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a crazy scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from the academy because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes he can control evolution by bringing one animal's properties into another. In this case, like many of its ilk, it is a transfusion of the wolf's blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army that he can control through antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener whose dialogue lowers this snail-shaped classic to almost a full stop. <br /> <br /> In addition to his experiments, Dr. Cameron also avenged those who discredited him using his transformed gardener. But he loses control over his subject, which begins to transform without the transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> Werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop action / makeup effects. It was undoubtedly these groundbreaking techniques of time; But in today's digital age, it is difficult to imagine that the audience is afraid of this.
