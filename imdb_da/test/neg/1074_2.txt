I caught 2:37 at AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It is a very well shot first film (although the DV format starts to appear in outside scenes) and I am sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, every page of high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or correct the promise of the premise. There are several signs, but none of them is more than what the plot requires them to be. There is no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "I'm worried about teen X, I have Y problem." The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally cumbersome. Let's start with the men. You have Stoner Kid, who is gay, the Jock who is also gay, the boy who rapes his sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent towards women and themselves. Of course (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes) the two gay men beat up women, Peepants and themselves. I would be fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow exceeded them. Nevertheless, no place was found, and that's all there is to these people's stories. <br /> <br /> Next ladies. A young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant woman's sister-in-law brother, and there is the girl who kills herself (I'll come later). Again, I do not think there is a demand for political correctness for filmmakers (I would be out of a job if that were the case), but I think that is justified only if there is more to that character or story . If that archetype was used to reveal something other than "I am a teenager and life sugar", I would be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subject to or changed or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and very sloppy storytelling. We must sit for 5 minutes by a girl who violently kills herself, as we have seen in maybe 30 seconds throughout the film? We've been following all those other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture us for a character that's not part of the story? It's cheap, exploitative and sloppy. Despite the millions of crappy indie movies that came before this, you have to practice something like that. You can't just buy it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go the same way but down, and the movie ends. What have I learned? I already knew that the elementary school sucked - was there, done it. I already knew that people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities are mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors and some really nice views of leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I've seen in a while.
