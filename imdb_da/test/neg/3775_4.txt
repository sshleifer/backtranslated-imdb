Veber is not known for its excellent management skills. In fact, no one worries as long as they get the laughs, a couple here to be honest, scattered throughout the process thanks to Depardieu's half-white characterization and the Veber dialogue. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough to make a good comedy, as there are no movies outside the usual Veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to quit a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères there was a real story that took place over the fire vs. water course. Le Diner de cons, although it was a game, managed to create a real excitement about the next disaster, Pinon would cause. In Tais-toi, the back of revenge is both superfluous and too weak to arouse our interest. Plus the tongues are paralyzed both on the screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> Now what's wrong? Veber wraps this up and creates no action, no rhythm. Instead, he uses systematic and bridal ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and the "music" really emphasizes the lack of nerve and backbone of history. So you have to be happy with Depardieu's performance.
