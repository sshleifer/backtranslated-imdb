I have to say I had low expectations for the movie before I saw it. All the people around said it was great, but I clearly knew what they liked. They like Aerosmith's song, which is really great, they like the amazing special effects that had rocked a lot, they like the movie's comedy site and of course many girls who love Affleck, which, in my opinion, is a really bad actor who not trying to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and reviews I read on the internet gave me a clue that the movie would be a big disappointment as I am a big disaster kind of movie fan. Well, I've been right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The movie is really commercial. It has been said, but I will say it again. We have over # 100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree to become part of a commercial if their Names are not capitalized on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are highly respected actors, whom I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different kinds of movies. They could improvise, they could make tasteless lines to fun jokes. On the whole, they could make small movies for really interesting, funny or dramatic movie pictures, people love and will always love. Like Fargo in Buscemi's Case or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed that they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to disappear. What I didn't like - well, I guess I've already been understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is boring, artificial and stupid. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that it is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that can be considered art. At least it is not so obvious that the film is made for economic purposes. Apart from that, bad performances from all the great stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes they do not make sense. In fact, I recently read that on the scene, Ben Affleck has asked Bay if it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill than tease astronauts, and Bay's answer is simply "Shut up!" which is a really fun story that perfectly shows the desperation of the creators. <br /> <br /> And enclosing, I explain why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like "Don't miss anything" and I was impressed by the special effects that are of course the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average instructor, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon, who was, and will always be, a great bad movie.
