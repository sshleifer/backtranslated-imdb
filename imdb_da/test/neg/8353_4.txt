If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the draft did its best to maintain script's action and interest, I was just comparing the episodes to the original series. There was an expectation that Steed participated more in battle scenes, and the continuity seemed as if the authors were struggling to follow the actors. To be honest, I can't blame them for trying to revive the fans from the original series, but it just didn't work out as it lasted for a season. Seeing Steed's work through this series reminded me of Gen. Macarthur, when he said, 'Old soldiers never die, they just disappear!'
