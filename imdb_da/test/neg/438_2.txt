I had long wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris because I loved her predecessor, but this movie did not impress me as much as an American werewolf in London. In fact, to be honest, it didn't impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his roommates wander around Paris and rescued in a perishable bungee stunt out of the Eiffel Tower wolfbabe Julie Delpy from death. Before you have the time to work out, if the constant curly and lumpy dialogue is supposed to be the comedy thing, a full moon has hit, and the quads are chased by terrible CGI werewolves down Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The writing is disgusting, the actors were made to make this movie, they are horrible notions match the status of the movie. From start to finish, this movie is never entertaining, engaging or even easy to see. I had trouble seeing this whole movie without throwing my dinner to be quite honest. The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not fun and the werewolves are not scary. In short, miss or be haunted forever. <br /> <br /> I rate a US werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
