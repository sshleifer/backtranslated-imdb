I'm really sorry this is the first bad review I've ever made for a movie ... EVER. I could stand to watch this movie, and that's the second movie in all the movies I've seen, it's just. .. downgrade. The first is open water, which just had no point at all. The Next Karate Kid had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I am wrong, thank you.) And the final line came as a shock. It was like, "If to fight ... win." then it showed the bird flying around and the pan whistle played, and I was like, oh. Okay, so it takes a while for this next part. AND THAT REQUIRES THE SCREEN. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! Hopefully I will never have to revisit a movie in a bad way again, I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid, really I really do ...
