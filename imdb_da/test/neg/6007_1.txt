Overrated, poorly written, badly acted. has the academy itself seen this? I do not think. The political content ensured it an Oscar nomination - the indo-pak border - a little boy, terrorism. Everything with the word "terrorist" gets attention in this post 9-11 world. It's like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination, regardless of their benefits. <br /> <br /> and please make visual arts not to shoot landscapes that are beautiful in the first place. You have to be a rotten shooter to turn up to make the desert beautiful. at least it doesn't win Oscar. they got it right at least. would have been a travesty.
