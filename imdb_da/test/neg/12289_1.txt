If you and your friends find so much humor and enjoyment from horrible plays, jokes, props, and overall movie production like me and my friends, then you should hire this. From just reading the tag line and seeing how not fun it is, you should assume no more fun, poor quality, great, fun content. It is a tale of some of the children who speak each physical and reality law and fly back in time through a modern big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs that eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilarious scene where T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yes ... It should be in the comedy section, but you will find it with kid movies if you ever find it. Then call your friends over, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote the ridiculously horrible a liners in this movie for weeks. "What about everything ruckus?!"
