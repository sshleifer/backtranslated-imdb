This movie may have the worst title for a stooge card ever dreamed. Something appropriate, considering the actual fifteen minute content. <br /> <br /> I can do without any of "Shemp A.D." things, but I will admit to having a few LOL moments from the two-man comedy that was offered by Moe and Larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to the guys trying to give it their all considering the position they were forced into doing these dogs themselves. Another highlight for this and the last AD debacle "Commotion on the Ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempt to make him speak or clap his arms like a chicken (see "Hot Stuff") may be worth an extra rating point. <br /> <br /> 2/10
