I'm not usually inclined to write reviews about movies I don't think deserve a mention. But in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I think it is important to express my thoughts when I do NOT like a movie. "The Queen of the Damned" is one of those films. Anne Rice's popular horror stories about Lestat, a bisexual vampire, first appeared on the screen in 1994 in the successful "Interview With A Vampire". Starring two of Hollywood's greatest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the movie stylish aesthetic and gothic mise a scene captured the audience. Although it may have been in style over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I have never been enamored with the vampire genre in general). Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on much bigger things. It was likely that both would have laughed with laughter as they were asked to appear in a sequel. They would have laughed even harder as they saw the final result. "The Queen of the Damned" characterizes the type of cr * p Hollywood is pleased to set off at a low price with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and a large marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds. . /> <br /> Needless to say, this movie is horrible from the start. Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of "Shooting Fish" fame, awakens from its dark grave to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He freaks out some confused punk musicians and joins their band, provided he only appears at night, what about the sun burning his skin and all during the day ... Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student, studying the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 maybe?), trying to find out if Lestat really is, as he says he is. Along the way she falls for him (something to do with her strange past), but has a small competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a vampire demontron who returns from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen king. <Br /> <br /> The film is shamelessly self-indulging, but its campy tone makes room for its depreciating humor. Anyone who sees this movie for anything but a good laugh needs to watch more movies in general! Seeing Townsend is fun. He knows the role is completely over the top and does his best to get close to each other between complete hamming and serious action. The late Aaliyah is unfortunately horrible in the title role. She has minimal screentime and she does not fully use it. The bad makeup and special effects do not help; at times it sounds like she is talking through a voicebox. There are rumors that this film was going straight to video until Aaliyah's relentless death last year. With the possibility that people can watch their last movie, Warner Bros puts this out for a general release. Otherwise, it would have been one of the movies you see on the shelf in video stores, but avoid because you can tell it will be simply awful. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about movies as this will continue to be made. Look at the scales teen rom-com rip offs around or spoofing the genre even with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market to exploit, Hollywood will. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie then they will pursue it. It's business. But what concerns me most is that people will actively go to the cinema and pay money to see it! I think that's the biggest argument in the cinema world: is cinema first and foremost, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide that are the audience. If you like and are fascinated by good movies, be free from this turkey.
