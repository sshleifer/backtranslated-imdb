On the core, this is a fairly typical revenge Western, heavy on spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist successfully successfully defeats the main cork. But there is so much going on that has no bearing on history, that one must wonder what the filmmakers were thinking about. I'm referring to things like the way Miss Rosie's song number just pops out of nowhere and boxing match in the middle of town. OK, they have a loose connection to influence the villain Mash Flanagan has, but why suddenly he comes up with an alias - Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> At the front, I thought it was quite innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded Wallach's view of the path could have been filmed by a person with an actual bullet in his shoulder. And wasn't it great how Donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little fresh? Also, let me not forget the great stunt work at the gravel pits, as Wallach guns down them as part of the final. There was still one thing unclear about, and I continued to wait for the whole movie for it. What happened to the trio of caps that Flanagan / Donovan hires near the start of the picture? You know, the guy Martel, that a funeral home wanted to hire for his gun trial, the devil's handyman Mitchell with the rifle and the knife thrower Lincoln Tate. Each had a $ 5,000 bounty upside down, and they had to protect Donovan from the guy who survived the massacre on the opening scene. They were never heard again! I like to think that maybe Donovan just had them killed and kept 15K for himself.
