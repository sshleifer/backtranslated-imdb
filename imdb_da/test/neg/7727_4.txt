Granted, HOTD 2 is better than Uwe Boll's crapfest, which was the first, but it's like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. OK OK, I'm a little tough with this one, it's just that video game adaptations of Zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was okay, but its successors are bad. The first HOTD was entertaining crap more than anything else; Uwe Boll saw it. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The entertainment value was there, the hot chickens were there, were there, but ... this is it? The script, although subpar, was better than the first. But in the manuscript, horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés, and an end that draws over and over, reach a level of ridicule that would make Bollmeister very, very proud. But it could have been worse right? HOTD 2 Stars Say Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a crazy doctor looking for a cure for death. As you can guess, it all goes to sh * t. A nearby college campus seems to be the center of the zombie (or hypersapia?) Epidemic, and as you might expect, a group of commands and two zombie scientists are trying to save the world by going there and neutralize the problem. Your main goal? No, it doesn't blow. Instead, they must get a sample of zombie blood so they can cure the deadly virus. Between this and there are mixed character interactions, an eerie amount of clichés (but hey, at least the black guy is not the first to be killed) and decent-looking zombies. <br /> <br /> The action is acceptable. Who would have thought Sticky Fingaz was an acceptable actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine something like the leaders. And the support molding was also acceptable. It was all reasonable. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects on the zombies were okay, it could have been worse than in the first HOTD: only the guys run around in dusty mummy suits. Gore was okay too. Cheap scares and even cheaper tensions are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid as f * ck, but at least there were no sword-fighting zombies or the ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will only appeal to zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and to anyone wishing to rent a cheap Horror movie over the weekend. Apparently, there will be a third as indicated by the end, but I wouldn't count on it. Unless uwe decide to do so. A 4.
