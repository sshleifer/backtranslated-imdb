Okay let's break it down. Why is this one of the worst movies ever? Because there are so many answers to that question, I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? Share with the Arab guy? It's just awful, I really don't care about the whole white racism crap, but when they did it with the Arab guy, I wanted to get the names of all the authors. It's really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even fun-bad, which was my first interpretation. I hope that the person who directed this movie does not commit suicide, but it seems likely, I see no other options. Never look at this movie, if you see it, you can't say you died without regret.
