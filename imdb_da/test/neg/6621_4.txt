Before I sat down and watched this movie on HBO, I expect nothing but a few laughs here and there and all of a silly and common plot. Well, that's exactly what I got out of it, except that I was a little happy at the end of the movie. I didn't expect to be what I thought it was just another and a half hours I had on my hands wasting. Well, it was, but it was still worth something. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some of the lines were very stupid. Other than that, it still had fun moments, though not many. All in all, if you have to rent this, you don't. Watch it on TV. I gave it a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but still it was pretty stupid.
