This is based on Mikael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander did a good performance, but saw nothing like Michael. I feel that Michael was portrayed as a stupid person, whom I do not believe he was (although he sometimes believed in the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael look white. I think Latoya should have been portrayed in this, she was always depicted with her brother in the 80s. I never thought any of the supporting casts looked like their colleagues. There were some things that inaccurate Lisa-Marie Presley's son looked around at the wedding scene, even though he was not yet 2 when Lisa and Michael were married. Also, when Michael tells his mother Katherine, he thinks he and Debbie should marry if she carries her baby, it was Catherine's idea that the two should marry.
