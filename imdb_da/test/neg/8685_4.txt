*** Minor Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I have to confess to having a soft spot for Wayne Crawford. I know a little about him, but he seems to have lots of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs multi-tasking - allowing any 3 from senior man, director, producer, and screenwriter - managing storytelling from the basement. Despite this, the end product is usually fun for the non-picky. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Below' has Crawford as an unfortunate captain on a ship's charter boat, just as Bogart in the 'At Garden & Garden Note' similarities between the films ends here. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers seeking a wreck before being attacked by an invisible creature - a bit like the beginning of 'jaws 2'. The wreck turns out to be that of 'El Diablo', which went down centuries earlier. The ship was manned by heretical priests on the track from Spain with a load of a stolen church treasure. This makes it possible to introduce various links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon, both looking in. The film's title refers to this submerged Devil ship, instead of any vicious sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever the mistakes the movie has (and there are many) it is fun to watch and competitively made. You can't stop a movie that in the last 5 minutes copies the famous beach scene in 'From Here to Eternity' and the final line from 'Casablanca'.
