Like the poster mentioned above, I was burned on the title, I was thinking of getting the other Piranha ... This movie is all that the above poster said and worse ... Bad camera, miserable play and just plain horrid story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here that was even worth seeing ... How this movie itself was released is over me. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you are buying is the one you want ... and not this one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was labeled "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" which is what it really is ... It's the only way they sold this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
