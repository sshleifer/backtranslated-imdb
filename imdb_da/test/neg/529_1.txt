Simply horrible. I include a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla joke from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil as it is already rotten. This dross was made during what should have been one of Sellers' "For A Few Dollars More" periods when he participated in some shed for a few bucks. I had seen this as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972, and then mocked it. No need to see it again; After 35 years, I now remember it as one of the five best hosts I had seen as a child. As I recall, Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a management here, but even his presence could not improve the outdated jokes, lame plot and infantile repartee. An ongoing theme deals with Sellers' use of fingers: In a scene, he holds his open hand to a group of medicines, and by folding his fingers up, the groups for which a hospital exists - the trainees, nurses, administrators, etc. are listed. . - Until only his middle finger gets up, then he says "... and the patients!" She has. In another scene, to avoid expensive laboratory tests, he throws a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar and exhort the trainees gathered around him to do the same as they do. He then advises them that he had placed his middle finger in the urine, but sucked his index finger and fitted them to pay attention. Hey, Hey. (The only reason I remember this and this movie and write this review is that a friend told me an even stupid version of this "joke" today). If you do this, you will be scary. If not, see 'Hospital', with George C. Scott (released the same year, 1972) for some genuine, wonderful black medical humor. Better yet, read 'God's house', by Samuel Shem, and if you can, watch the movie version of the one that has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I would like to finally see it) .
