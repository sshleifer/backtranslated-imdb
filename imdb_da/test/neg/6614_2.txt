I saw this with great enthusiasm, and my fear was well-founded, it seems. What was this movie about? Knight? Season? Players? What? It was everywhere all the time. It had no excitement (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mail in anger and delivers zero voltage. Cheap shot, like a MacGiver episode. Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the job HBO did on the Don King movie "Only in America" ​​to show how to do sports biopics, warts and everything. Note that ESPN promoted hell out of it and then it never showed again?
