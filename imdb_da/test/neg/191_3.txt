I never heard of this movie when it first came out. It should be sunk immediately. : o) I looked at the cable while I was ill in the hospital, so I hardly had enough energy to see it, let alone beat the channel. Better choices than Style Channel. ; 0 (Filmed on the spot, this trip should have been on the Travel Channel. The plot is being reused from ship colors in the thirties and eighties. The shock seems to have been reused from the 50s. Donald O'Connor, star of musicals and Edward Mulhare as a shorthair. Regarding the lead role, Walter Matthau still plays the same role as he did in Guys and Dolls, or was it the one about the orphan? Wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder does not take with a man of his age. He's so straightforward, he can barely dip and slide when he dances, and as mentioned, Dyan Cannon is incredibly attractive as another scammer who sails with her mother who thinks Walter is rich while he thinks she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother, another fifty-year-old retriever. The most fun is the ongoing feud between Brent Spiner as the dominant and snotty cruise director who immediately sees Walter as a bad dancer and spends his time increases to get him dismissed so he has to pay for his free passage. Eventually, even though he receives his comeuppances. Meanwhile, Jack meets an attractive woman with common attraction, but their affair has broken up by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired departmental purchaser. But finally, the two men take off at sea in a rubber boat to catch their water flight and everything is good. There seems to be no main player under fifty.
