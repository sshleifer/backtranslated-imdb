"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I want to add "brainless" to this list, but movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps narrow out that label. The landscape has changed from the Californian beaches to the Greek islands, and the only recurring cast members from the first movie are Sorrell's Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point fall into a mud pit that reminds her classic catfight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but apparently Brad Zutaut has to play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer did in "Hardbodies". This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and does not come close to matching it in the "hotness" section. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very beautiful, but Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers team is invincible. "Hardbodies 2" is not the worst of its kind in any way, but if you only want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to download. (* 1/2)
