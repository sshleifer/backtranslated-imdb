The Alien Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the study of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in toxins Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominate Jack and tie him up to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack suggests US $ 100,000.00 for each to protect him in negotiating antiques "Spanish judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with her retarded boyfriend, who thinks she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. But Jack crosses the collector twice, and he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish judges" is a film with a sensible manuscript with a horrible conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful, but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they cannot save the stupid story. Moreover, the scenes that were supposed to be fun, unfortunately, do not work, and in fact they are stupid and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
