Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts ok. Her husband cheats her and she finds out the national television. So she has to rebuild her life. Here it could have been interesting or built up in a story line, but you get so sad. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin starting to beat her. The two have no real chemistry at all, but you should get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends as you think it will, but you want it not finished like any other like it. They had a good start with this movie and could have made it easy to see, but instead it is a movie you will definitely miss.
