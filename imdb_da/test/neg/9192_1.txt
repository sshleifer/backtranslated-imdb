One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​primarily too fat to be a rookie firefighter. NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury dads boys. John Travolta has a bad dye job, and the odd look of the eye throughout the film made me think he was on a sort of expanded Scientology bender. The plot hits all the tropics and clichés about what the average Joe thinks that life as a firefighter is real: they all become full, go into battle, have difficulty expressing their feelings, their wives are all at home and crying Does dad have problems, everyone has a Boston accent, et cetera. An execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9-11 - which, incidentally, was a valid cultural hero. Unfortunately, this film presents no credible heroes to worship.
