a really horrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing end one complete. a talk time in my point of view I thought it was a TV movie, but then I didn't think I couldn't imagine having paid to see this treasure chest, please avoid this movie at all costs. Although you liked jaws that I did on average, you can't see for yourself if you have interests in paleontology, you can't see it yourself if you like corny movies with corny actors, corny plots during corny tv time , do humanity a favor and do not, repeat I DO NOT contaminate you with this ridiculous excuse for a sci-fi expensive thriller still, some people gave it a ten ranting ... do not know if they were serious or not (but expect sincerely they were not)
