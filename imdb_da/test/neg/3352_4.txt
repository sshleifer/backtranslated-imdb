I had never even heard of a dark night before anyone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently, and I became interested because of Meg Tilly's commitment and acknowledged that it was an early admission to Friday the 13th. : JASON LIVES Director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately sad to say it is nothing special. The prerequisite is familiar with it: a dorm girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum tomorrow to join a sorority. The girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to prove to her loving girlfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels) that she can do her cruel, alluring ex-girlfriend, Carol's (Robin Evans) sorrow regardless of the tactic she draws. to see her failure. Along with Carol's gang, Kitty (Leslie Speights) is always with a toothbrush in his mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) doesn't want to cause Julie such problems. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while remaining in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol, and Kitty encounter an evil they couldn't imagine. The cure of a newly ill "mental vampire" whose telekinesia was dangerously strong will try to drain them of their very life force. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of death, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who is equipped with the same psychic power he has. <br /> <br /> I think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil threatening the girls in the mausoleum, it is certainly different from what you usually see in the slaughterers who were out at this time. Like Adam West's character (... he was Olivia's cynical man who found the idea of ​​his father's power ridiculous), I had a really hard time adjusting to the sticky plot and I personally never found anything in the movie to be thrilled with . The mausoleum for me was really not that scary (... it doesn't really get the same kind of scary quality PHANTASM caught) and the bodies used to attack the girls are ridiculously convincing (.. there is a big scene where a body of the body melts away ). I have a soft spot for low budget movies from this time period, but I just never really found a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfactory immortal game that shoots electric balls from the eyes that make other bodies break free their crypts to obey their master It's just for the silly to take seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a nice girl dating a previous flame. Steve is your typical, creaking, pure American girlfriend, handsome and tender, who becomes the hero who seeks to save her girl from which outrageous forces are at stake. To make up for the little budget director, McLoughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience using a series of ooga-booga effects like corpses that pursue young girls, chairs that shake and shake, doors that slam shut and objects levitate on own hand. Of course, the movie has the fans, and I'm glad I had a chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT wasn't the horror sleep I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role as the worried man and hopes that his wife will snatch out her depressed state with regard to a father who had nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is the troubled Olivia who acknowledges that she must stop her father once and for all, otherwise he would continue to swap the living. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's father, who informs her of what he was. I wasn't particularly blown away by Tilly's performance here (... she was basically scared mostly), but she would have a chance to prove herself more from this point forward. This will undoubtedly be of some value to those who saw it back at that time, for nostalgia purposes it can seduce fans of movies from this era.
