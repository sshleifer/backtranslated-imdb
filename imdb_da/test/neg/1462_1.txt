This movie was pretentious, foppish, and just not fun. The recording technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But what was he thinking about? So much more thought could have entered this movie, considering the subject. This could have been a true theoretical battle over good and evil, but Hartley, it seems to use stand technique to brush out the viewer.
