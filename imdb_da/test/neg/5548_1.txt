Well, it removed my nerves raw, they got it right. I first rented this movie back in the 80s when my friend opened a video store that bore every rare movie he could find. He also carried all the shocks, horror and exploitation movies he could dig up, and I went through almost all of them. Earlier I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs and Wizard of Gore. They were cruel (especially for the time period), and the guide by Gore became quite unpleasant. However, the Gore-Gore Girls was the one I remember being the most obnoxious. <br /> <br /> I rented it on DVD a little while ago because I wanted to hear the comment and thought it could have some cool dancing and clothes. I forgot that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion had gone a bit downhill then. I also realized that it was a movie I didn't really need to see more than once. It had entertaining parts but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I am very abandoned to film gore, but a couple of times I was just too gross and had to look away. This was not a good choice of movies to put on DVD all sharp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality. The commentary is entertaining in parts and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Maybe HG Lewis wasn't that good that day, but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to be offended when Something Wild's interviewer compared him to Ed Wood Jr. Sorry, but you're not exactly Martin Scorsese himself. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A sweet reporter and a really uninteresting private detective team up (kind-he can't seem to stand her) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A lot of really ugly murders happen. <br /> <br /> I'm going to apologize in advance because I don't want to sound like I need to light up, but this movie was so misogynistic that it was p *** saved me more than "Company of Men ". Mainly because the extreme character of the protagonist and director for women - and the audience - just oozes from each frame. It's not just the murders. The very mismatched detective goes out of her way to treat the female reporter as the dog's dirt on every occasion for no apparent reason (he's not exactly a threat to George Clooney as I said) and she still follows him as a puppy. She fails to see a terribly mutilated body, and he looks at her with pretense and then throws cold soda from a can on the face to wake her up. Later he calls the police to report the crime - "No ... no speed ... she just seems to have ... lost face." This guy is the HERO. One can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I could go on, but you get the idea. Be aware that I make this movie sound much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it really is. <br /> <br /> Most of the casts are the kind of actors you never ask to take off their clothes - not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see nudity unless you're not too fussy. The go-go dancers all look as though they desperately want the scene to end so they can get their $ 10 or whatever rate HG paid them, and get their drug deal. Okay, it wasn't that bad, there was a dancer who looked like she could have been a pro and also another cool dancer with a big afro that wasn't as miserable as the rest but still not so excited. The only slightly entertaining things were a few moments of brief accidental humor, as when a policeman in charge of a murder scene screams frightened "Get out here before I have all arrested!" not to a bunch of journalists, but to another policeman who quietly goes about their work (they mumble and stroll away). Henny Youngman, however, is funny, but as Lewis says, he said his lines so quickly that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to get the whole day busy so he could get paid and get the hell out from there, though he doesn't look like looking at some chickens. <br /> <br /> May be worth looking out of morbid curiosity - for the era the movie was made, it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at that time - or if you're really big HG Lewis fan and Find him or her low-budget film making anyone fascinating. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and can move on to other obnoxious but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early 70's ... this movie doesn't even come close, "Pink Flamingos says" when it comes to the spring-the-popcorn factor. If you've never seen a HG Lewis movie, I recommend trying "Blood Feast" first, you get a much better time. <br /> <br />
