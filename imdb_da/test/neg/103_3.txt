Too bad is this movie not. While the "Nemesis Game" is mildly entertaining, I found it difficult to suspend my unbelief all the length of the movie, especially the situations in which Sara sat. Should we believe it: <br /> <br /> 1) This hot chick goes dormant unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some puzzles? <br /> <2) The main characters are apparently such experts that they play horror games for fun, but don't let the whole "I never minded" riddle to the very end ... and then ... and then ... get this. .. she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put pieces together ?? I know it was the cinema's unit to show the audience what was happening, but do they really think we are so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to question the blonde, there is no topless chick in the whole building. Nada. C'mon. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And anyone else notes that when Vern surfed the web and found the riddlezone site when he moused over the link cursor remained an arrow and did not become a little hand (like all drivers do when you click a hyperlink)?!? I mean, if you make the internet play such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things right. Geez.
