Yes, I couldn't stop spawning, nor my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to stretch for at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but it just falls asleep on your feet - unless you're a 70-pole neck sweater fan! <br /> <br /> ** NEXT SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you were expecting something to happen, don't hold your breath - it doesn't! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it doesn't even convince or involve the guard. It is like a long, boring and rather heterogeneous dream. Frederic flows through it, is able to leave work whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries who bring tea and messages constantly. Of course not real life! And an office with almost no paper or files - just a huge calendar to tell you that the movie really takes 6 months to watch. <br /> <br /> Neither does Frederick seem to be touched by any real feeling, even his wife and children behave like a rag doll - in stark contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong views, never gives the appearance of feeling anything. The only 3 seconds of a real feeling occur between a couple watched in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot. Okay, so maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's entertainment or even good movies you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly overstated by most other viewers.
