This absurd movie was about a "Goodie-two-shoe" teenage girl who really wanted to be Valedictorian, but found her obstacle in a teacher's wife Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces "the biggest dilemma in her teenage life" when this classmate of her joins the specimen to help them stitch Mrs Tingle's test. Mrs. Tingle comes together, catches Holmes, classmate guy and her best friend with the test of her final exam. Convinced that the three of them were planning to cheat here, Mrs Tingle admires her opportunity to destroy Holmes once and for all with claims that can remove any chance Holmes is passing through his class. And classmate, who apparently has an eye on Holmes, always wondered why she never gave him time in the day (he's an idiot)? Feeling desperate, visit Holmes and her friends Mrs Tingle in the middle of the night to try and deter her from believing that Holmes was planning to cheat. The whole thing somehow burns when the classmate guy points to a bow and arrow on Mrs. Tingle and threatens her to do things right for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle struggles back, but eventually ends up as Holmes and her friend's captivity. During Mrs. Tingle's capture during Holmes, they do everything to tie her and gag her in her own bed to deter her with fake pictures that they took from the unconscious coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I shot myself when the kids were at home in Mrs. Tingle's house, ate their food and went about their private work. At one point, Holmes found Mrs Tingle's character book and deliberately changed the character of her favor and reduced the character of her valedictorian challenge. The end played out as a childish attempt to bring back the comedy, which was sparse at the start of the movie, and resolved on sheer irony, slapstick and absurdity. This must be the most unlikely and evil evil character Holmes would ever play throughout his life. I would help Mrs Tingle get free to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and insidious. She even slept with the classmate's guy despite the overwhelming interest of his best friend for him ... and she didn't like him. From trying to destroy her challenging qualities by seizing Mrs Tingle's character book to taking her best friend's husband, would you think Holmes would get what she deserved in the end, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything she wants and shows that it is evil, manipulative, selfish and sound, can get you what you want. <br /> <br /> Wife. Tingle was probably the character you didn't like. They did not lead me to that point once to believe that she was this woman who was to "learn this lesson." She was like any other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her anger over the next generation. Personally, I felt that her opinions on young people were validated with the actions of Holmes and her friends every time. I was hoping she could call the police and stitch Holmes. They kept her tied up in bed, ate her food like a bunch of pigs, drank the woman's wine, crushed her personal belongings, and supposed she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads? And the classmate's guy must be one of the most disliked characters in the film's history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for him who is not in Webster's dictionary. He brought the biggest problems in Holme's life and made it worse when he entered Mrs Tingle's house, uninvited behind Holmes and corners Mrs Tingle with a bow and arrow. I was thrilled every time Mrs Tingle had a chance to get out of him or stifle the best friend of the wannabe actress. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager out there and want to see when a teenager's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her world, see this unfunny, caricature, accidental movie noir.
