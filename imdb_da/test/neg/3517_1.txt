This movie is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling that tries to hide behind an "art movie" facade and tries to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover the lack of psychological depth of characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, from thanks to Bela Tarr in the beginning, for photography, acting, music, history and editing. Suddenly, for no reason, you are forced to look close to "charismatic" look-out Hungarian landlords in their boats, while the soundtrack tries to persuade you that this should be a dramatic moment, even though they are only on their way to the burial of the local alcoholic, that's one thing. Setting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is another thing that I absolutely have no understanding of. This movie really tries hard to get into a particular genre of artistic (Eastern European drama kind) movies, but lacks the subtlety, observational skills and "soul" that other directors have.
