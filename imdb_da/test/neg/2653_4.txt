I really like Harrison Ford, so I eagerly rented this movie just to be disappointed minute by minute. Mr. Ford seemed to go through very hot water looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had better lines. The story fascinated me, but the error - BIG MISTAKE - all of which are identified by driving license or passport before embarking on a US commercial vehicle, left many plot issues in my mind. <br /> <br /> I could have cared less about these people. In fact, the subplot of the internal affairs study was more interesting than the two loved ones killed while flying first class to Miami. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the director, Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie and other movies. This is a waste of time and energy.
