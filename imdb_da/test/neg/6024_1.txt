I remember that Hey Hey Fuss and I saw Jackson Jive, it was a really pretty forward comedy shit, but I saw it & it's free and is out there? Have I missed something? If the black community should complain about any racist comment in a TV show, it should be this, and if you've read my previous comments, I'm not the easy to offend guy. The basic plot is that there is an African / American movement in the side of this white guy and they make these racist comments as the value of a house will fall just because of black neighbors and the white guy makes references (if you slightly offended by race veil Read more) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize, but it really does happen in this show, I'm really a guy that's fine with the black community) People can say Hey lights up, but even when you take the racer off, it's not fun No new jokes, that is badly acted Can swear in an episode, I saw that a person's eyes focus on something that is not related to the situation. All in all, terrible comedy.
