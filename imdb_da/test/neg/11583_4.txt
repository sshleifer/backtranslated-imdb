Nothing will ever come to KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (!), But KvC is not quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Just be sure to look at it when it is full or rocky or while trying to go to bed. The imaginative title says it all in all: A group of most unknown actors converge on an island where a government attempt to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Gigantic creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken the island and eaten it all. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island wherever people are. The action is wonderfully horrible, especially a mustachioed general right out of THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series, but it is typical of this kind of cable cable. The CGI creatures are TV-level quality, which means that you know you are seeing comic strips. However, two of the gals in the group are very sweet and worth seeing as they run here and there in their tight little clothes. You just want to eat them!
