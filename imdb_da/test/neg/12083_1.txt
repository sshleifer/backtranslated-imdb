This film had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it needed was another director. That is for sure. And maybe another leading lady. I just can't understand Minnie Driver's character - or at least how she played it. She was absolutely incredible. I can't believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably left by the director or unable to deliver what the director was trying to get her to do. I'm writing this when I still see it. I think I would have hated being in her shoes trying to 'act' something I didn't understand. Well, we just went to the case she started with her son (I still look). I am now starting to be deeply embarrassed by everyone involved in this business. If you enjoy watching movies that miss their field in a big way, watch it here.
