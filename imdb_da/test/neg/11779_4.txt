This movie, which I just discovered in the video store, has apparently been in a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York, searching for their girl from high school who now lives homeless under the seafront at Coney Island, has flashes to be a very good movie, but ultimately is weighted by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel, rather than their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is, as usual, very good, and the film has a good sharp look to it, with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, author Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are concerned with dealing with the relatively uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie. A flashback in a music store where Richie has a crush on an employee, stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie could have gone. But in the end, not much. Two many extracted scenes of irritation, such as inside the Skeeball building. RATING 4 out of 10.
