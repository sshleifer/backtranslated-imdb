Of course I am disappointed, so I will be short and will not waste your time. First, the plot was uninspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we are in 2008 for God's sake, and it looked like a shimmering version of G.I.Joe. I do not even want to disturb the characters' performances and dialogues. Or maybe I want, because I just like to write a comment here, you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Oh yeah, yes, it was completely flat, lacking in passion and talent if I apologized. Now as for the dialogues, like the plays, no memorable quotes, nothing that anyone would not expect. Let's just hope the movie will be decent ... at least.
