Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks - the classic "godfather" and another case of over-hype due to media circles. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi movie by Ram Gopal Varma as an instructor, is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy, including the other two are the excellent-Satya and Company. Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two bachchans who play father's duo on the screen for the first time, is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not only strong performances, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded. But the same equation in the duo is missing with the other characters in the movie. Reason - the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. The bad guys represent the typical Bollywood baddies. A character that attracts attention is older son, played by Kaykay, but again unable to hold due to half-baked characterization. . Drama and conflict are brought to life by the exaggerated use of Close-Shots, which led to a claustrophobic effect with the right need to build an atmosphere. The haunting score (Amar Mohile) and the sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev) along with the dark, foamy backdrop overlaid by shiny powerful images (camera work by Amit Roy) contribute to visuals so typical of Ramus style. But there is an overuse of music, but fortunately there are no songs in the movie. But can interest in today's "intelligent growing" audience be maintained on the shoulders of two artists and strong visuals? I do not think. Surely the audience "maangey more" and here movies fail to deliver. At any adaptation, the greatest prerequisite for manually adding a new dimension manuscript, which is sluggish here, is not sharp in places, and therefore the pace is lowered quite often. What finally the audience is exposed to is a very predictable, very common drama with very little surprise elements. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form. Some scenes that require a different treatment include - a minister wrongly speaks over Sarkar, and the son is overheard; a very amateur shooter in the prison at Sarkar, Sarkar Jr. escaping from his enemies, a son who is easily motivated to kill his own father, a son secretly entered his father's room to kill him, a police officer beating Sarkar Jr - all this requires a more realistic, hard-hitting approach, which is the hind leg to create the required conflict. The dialogues are weak for example. look at an amateurish line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr. ??????????????? The uninterrupted negotiations on criminal activities, while Sarkar is with the family, also look a little in place. In fact, the film follows a graph similar to Ramu's own production Ab Tak Chhappan. In the portrayal of the struggle between good and evil, the other side of life - the law, the police, the administration, the policy are completely ignored. It is decided that more content is expected. Here, the film falls clear and cannot rise above an average fare. Dear Ramu, agreed that you are now laughing on the road to the bank and you must definitely take some drastic overhaul in your film production factory before it's too late.
