The new celebrity deathmatch is horrible. They kill the popular people and win the low budget chambers. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil Flip and Lil Wayne were both dead. Lil 'flip sucks. the match between Lil 'Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was MAD corny and short. They should just kill them all. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian lose to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking rather than fighting, which can carry the viewers. Everything seems premature for some reason, they can't just make a long fight? the old deathmatch is far better.
