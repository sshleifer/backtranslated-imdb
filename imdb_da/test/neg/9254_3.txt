I saw this movie solely because it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I'm glad I saw it because it's now "another Video Nasty down" - on its own, Andy Millig's movie really isn't worth the trouble with. Of course, there are far worse movies on the infamous list; But it does not hurt by seeing this one easier. The movie was apparently shot at an extremely low budget and it has translated into the script; as Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema, and does nothing new with it. The reason is the center of three couples who are in a house awaiting the results of a will. It's not long before they start picking ... blah blah blah. For most of the film, nothing happens; And then when we finally come down to the scenes that justify the film being banned, they are so amateurish and stupid that they are impossible to take seriously at any level. It is very good that this film does not have a very long maturity, otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all boils down to an appropriate boring ending, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. Apparently, this film is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it is because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites are not worth seeing and I personally can't see any reason to recommend it. Unless of course you've made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list ...
