Huge, waddling, grimacing tree trunk threats false "natives" on a "Pacific Atoll" (looks suspicious as Southern CA ...), reaking havoc and revenge. Unlike the stupid stumps in "Navy VS The Night Monsters", Tabonga is actually a grown-up man tree. Well grown for 2 days: You must have been baptized on these Miracle Grow spikes ... Anycow, it does not come from hell, but from the grave of a false native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The Zombies of Mora Tau"), murdered by the native elders to hang out with the terrible American scientists. The researchers include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Under the Apes Planet") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "Colossal Beast's War"). Rounding the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as the unpleasant Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious cartoon aid spurting out a blatantly fake "cockney" accent. A stellar throw indeed !! Anycow, because his lovely vacant wife, Korey, played amateurly with Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin"), helps set him up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the elders. Then the drowsy American scientists breed the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science", and allow it to slow down slowly about the island and kill anyone who has made him wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry fair girls, so Tabonga addresses the female female scientist Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and gets rid of her. Vine allies, a good shot with a Remmington hitting a knife embedded in Tabonga, and falling over dead in quicksand. This ridiculously foolish cceptcept is one of the all-time cheesy howlers. Tabonga is undoubtedly the slowest monster in the moovie story, right up there with the clanky, robotic robot from "Robot Monster vs. Aztec Mummy" and the perversely slow carpet sample from "Creeping Terror". Try not to laugh while you see Tabonga throwing false natives down the hills and in quicksand, dodging spears and slowly emptying the "island". Shady writing, wood performances and sappy direction suggest that this pulpy fertilizer has far mooore bark than bite. This warm heap of wood chips was the last hurray of the long-standing editor-turned director Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared into well-deserved haze after this movie. You rent it through the vine from MooCow first: "From Hell it Came" is a compost classic! : ??
