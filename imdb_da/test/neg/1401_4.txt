Just funny how comments on this movie went downhill, now add mine. I think the script could have been saved by better acting and acting with a better script. Together, it was hard to look at, and I didn't like that subject. Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was basically the only new thing this movie offered to her genre), but even she beat herself. Cannot blame her who knows what was taken, was left on the rocks floor by the director and / or editor. The whole movie had an "okay, that's good enough, let's move on" feel when I know there was more to be reminded of the actors and the script, which had some good lines and some interesting themes. <Br /> <br /> I don't think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney marches up to her son's suspected tormentor's house and looks at her face and I thought "it is the face of someone who overcomes what it is to see someone living in a mobile home "and probably enough, next shot, is thought to shock us. I am sure bullying in a trailer as opposed to a lovely house like her. <br /> <As many other posters have pointed out, there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts on similarly broken families that hit the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the ultimate example I've seen.
