Although the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I have to say that their attempt to launch feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach, came up short. Why should Roach choose the civil war, which is subject to all the adhering racism that would follow. <br /> <br /> Dashing Southern Cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphaned Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky accidentally exposes a brief cheat on a riverboat. Everything is quiet and calm in the old south and then the civil war comes to ruin it for everyone. But even children can charm the worst in the world and there is no worse than the regular yankees. They just came south and destroyed it for everyone. Criticized, even though it was for its southern point of view, Gone With the Wind made a good case for the southern cause, and the blacks portrayed although servile as they would be out of necessity are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won his Oscar if that was not the case. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy as stupid and vacuum as she was, has a certain dimension. <br /> <br /> However, here are some of the worst racial stereotypes ever presented in Hollywood. The composition of Spanky and Buckwheat shows that the children come together, racial feelings are not acquired inbred. It is not the vulnerability of the vulnerability that is contradictory, but there is total acceptance of it. Right from the horrible watermelon song sung over the title credits, General Spanky's message is a bad one. <br /> <br /> But it got an Oscar nomination for sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever come out of the short subject area. <br /> <br /> However, General Spanky is far from the wind.
