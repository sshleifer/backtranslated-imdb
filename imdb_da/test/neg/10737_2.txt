Just a few words: It's a good thing, George A Romero is still among us, if he were dead, he would be forced to stand up from the grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' I am actually agree with these people's feelings. Yes, there are zombies in it, and they have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them finishes the doctor from Startrek Voyager. It's about as scary as it gets people. If you're looking for a horror movie, I suggest you watch. And if you're looking for a witty political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called the Masters of Horror. But let me not hold you back: perhaps there is something I have missed. Though the chances are, you will waste your time with what I have. Let's just say I prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing outside the camera.
