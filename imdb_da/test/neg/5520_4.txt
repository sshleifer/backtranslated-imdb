Oddly enough, it is Fred MacMurray who plays the more "screwed" part in this screw basketball comedy. Carole Lombard shows a good performance that combines brighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness. As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of his, he is not that attractive, and he has no style and panache to pull out this very Cary Grant-like role. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the friendly friend returns to life through his relationship with Lombard's character. One can only wonder why her character will not have her gentle, soothing love instead of the almost definite judgment in MacMurray's tenure. But it's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image works almost but misses the mark, primarily because of MacMurray's performance. It would have been great to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely credible and sympathetic; MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him in the arm's length.
