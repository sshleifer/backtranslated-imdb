I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Every time she was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything other than her hair. Take the stage presence! There also appeared to be many people with hearing problems in this movie. There was a traffic manager who wrote a parking ticket that somehow did not allow the owner to fall against the car, screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone box who couldn't hear a big bulldozer come to him until it was 5 feet away. All the affected men in this movie seemed a little deaf, no one had to sneak at them. The one extradited 'hero' of this movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was fun. The bar fight was pretty fun. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judged from their expression, it was not good for any of them. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is on the 50 Movie Pack Martial Arts set if you want to see many bad movies (with some decent ones).
