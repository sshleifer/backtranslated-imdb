Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretends to be something spiritual, but bashing heads and kills as it was nothing. He eventually justifies it by donating the money to an orphanage. How sweet. Let the world play and we will ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time he is a partner with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Must have someone to put all the cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty. The dialogue is pure crap. They go after the bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people who were born to play scumbags. <br /> <br /> He hugs Mari Morrow and impresses with soap star Sarah Buxton. How sweet. <br /> <br /> I guess if you need some July excitement, it might be enough. If nothing else it will help you get your degree in Seagalology.
