photography is good, the costumes are good, but editing is poor. The different scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and boring. This slowness continues throughout the show. It's a very boring show to see. . . . I think several scenes should have been added, but it would make it a longer show. It is very slow moving. The authors should have made it just a one-night show and not prolong our pain the night after. There is nothing else else, otherwise I would change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the times and angry with the white men for what they did for the Indians, but that is our story.
