"Speck" was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer Richard Speck. However, there is not much killing in this movie and none of them are explicitly shown. Perhaps the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is when Speck stumps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in his own bathtub, but even this is implied and not shown except for a few convincing downward pressures on Mr. Specks legs. The most entertaining part of this movie is most likely voice-over, which should be a testament to the mind-numbingly boring nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is terrible. Unless you have a love for boredom, don't bother. This movie only looks into 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.
