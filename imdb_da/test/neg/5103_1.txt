The film itself is just a collection of scenes that have no intrinsic meaning to anyone living outside Russia. I do not deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at that time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it has no interest in the intellectual or ordinary man. We just see an arranged form of images, ranging from a one-man man hitting a horse to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, random and completely unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum that kept the viewer interested, but it would not be, even though the director's method is quite brilliant. On the whole, one should see this if they are an art student, on hallucinogenic drugs or a student of pre-Tarkovskian cinema.
