I rented this movie because it seems to be in a jazz club - you know, the high, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there's not an ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. The point is greasy, the original songs are terrible, both the main actor's song is off-key in the future (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meet girl", the play is ridiculous and the only decent one Biographical moments are stock footage scenes. The jazz club scene has a sophomoric dialogue that is disturbed by too busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco should hold his day job (unless his day job helps with movie scores). Is it possible to not only get my four dollars back but also have my treatment sessions paid? This movie, interestingly enough, is so bad you might see it. A kind of driving on a bad accident - you just have to look at least once. Just get ear plugs ready!
