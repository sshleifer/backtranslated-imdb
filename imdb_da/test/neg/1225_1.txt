Wow ... like a big fan of Larry McMurtry's western tales and especially the Lonesome Dove series in particular, I was s-o-o-o looking forward to Comanche Moon. What a huge letdown. Perhaps my expectations were set too high because of Lonesome Dove's excellent expertise ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... it all worked. Comanche Moon is compared across as a bad Saturday Night Live shit. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is babble and the plot winds fun everywhere. It seems that the actors all read from TelePrompTers. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, good guys, evil guys, not even the random characters. David Midthunders performance stands out in particular. It seems that it was picked out by an eighth grade middle school performance. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive to say about Comanche Moon, but I just can't do it. There is nothing there.
