A hulking alien beastie collides on Earth and soon vomits destroys the population first by using his laser beam to dissolve in dust, almost every human being, he catches sight of (that is, when his goal is not terrible) and later his mere claws as he likes to tear out and eat man made spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's pretty stupid stuff. I have to give it some points to be a little fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless jet gun battle in the beginning and some of the later over the top performing effects. But it doesn't help when the monster gives the movie's only really entertaining moments, and he's not on the screen for much of the movie's running time. The action throughout this is simply horrible and amateurish, and our leading hero Sheriff Cinder is far too attractive to be the hottest chick of the movie. I also have to devote points to copy the THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) on several occasions. When the monster is not on a rampage, NIGHTBEAST is too boring and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable, even though they become less fun. Watch this one back to back with 1951 THING and see the difference characterization, attention to plot and detail and create excitement making a monster on the loose film.
