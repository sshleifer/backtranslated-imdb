I can not believe it! Were they crazy about filming a film about Connecticut in Southern California? For God's sake, there is the Palm Tree everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, a guy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws down a newspaper. The newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald" it has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND GREENWICH TIMES." (Referral to Stamford, Connecticut Newspaper). Perhaps the filmmakers should have done some research, I mean my God, at least get the name of the newspaper on the right or film in places that at least look distant as Connecticut.
