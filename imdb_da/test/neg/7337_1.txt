Is it just me or the fact that the evil racial team is Japanese, and that their arrogant star traces are German, seems a little over the top? Maybe that's the way it is on the international racing circuit, but if all of America represented them, chumps like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who has still learned to trade), will be twisting for another country. Formula film can be good, but the characters must be sympathetic, and no one meets these criteria in this movie. To put it briefly - a very bad movie.
