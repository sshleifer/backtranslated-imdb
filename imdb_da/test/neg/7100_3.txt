It is as if the editor and the scriptwriter only had 40 minutes of real life. This should be a remake of a Chinese movie that is clearly far better than this trash can. Clearly, some mindless Hollywood costumes or authors decided that this movie would be a mano man against man, rather than just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters built in the first 40 minutes. At this point in the film, the characters do not function as ordinary people and not even as their own personalities. It makes no sense. It is quite clear why this film flopped. It's just not credible, and it's too bad - it started with promise. Don't be fooled.
