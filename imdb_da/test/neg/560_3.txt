Young spinster, who does not associate women with her own age and is eyed by a gentleman from the guest house, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly polite to hide his own sexual insecurities, she is most satisfied when the boy gets home in his guest bedroom ... but not so happy when he starts sneaking out of the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not a careless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sackrollers, I think we never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles and so far away from a commercial drama that you could get, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static at best). The story seems almost a sex-turn of "The Collector", a brand that may have sold the movie rights, but which does not turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the movie's best order (Dennis shop for a prostitute to satisfy his prisoner) does not go completely out, with Sandy acting both ill and annoying (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good as the child who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for his comfortable tombs, but he is handled too much by Altman, with many strategically placed towels and meat-colored underpants (Altman was clearly not ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this time). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; She does not cheat away thoughtlessly here, she thinks before she speaks, and she is alarmingly cautious in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparently slipping in mental degradation, which seems to happen off-screen. As such, the sudden final madman, and the overall results are lukewarm. * 1/2 from ****
