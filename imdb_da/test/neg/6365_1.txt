When I heard the movie being released and the theme of what it was all about, I felt very curious. But when I saw it was the biggest deception in my life. Technically, the sound is bad, you can tell about man-dialogues that were restored on a study that is poorly achieved in the final blend. Second, the photograph is mediocre, some of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the filmmaker achieves the "dark night" is illuminating everything as if they were in an actual military base of light, no reference is used by the moonlight my God! Thir but not least, most of the things are really poor, it is absolutely not credible that one of the soldiers' wife, her performance, is pretty poor. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment, the jury's shame chose to send this movie to the representation of Colombia on the Oscar.
