I'm a longtime fan of the original movie (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes the movie great and fun to see is missing from this. I miss the slow pace, the building of characters and their style in small movements, the domination of light and mood, and moving over dialogue. I don't think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more secluded, and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, the things that make a scene big in the original are not in its copy here. The small changes remove the tension. My opinion is that you have to go see the original. It will be the inconvenience of subtitles.
