This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic, and I was ready to have a good time. At least I thought I could stop it. But I was wrong. First, is the strange looping? It was like watching "America's Funniest Home Videos". The marvelous parents. I hated them so much. The stereotypical Latino family? I'll talk to the person responsible for this. We need a conversation. The little girl who always hung on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now the last scene goes over, I have to say. It's so wonderfully bad and full of evil that it's a movie of its own. What crappy dances. Terrible and beautiful at once.
