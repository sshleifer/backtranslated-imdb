Horrible, confusing bit of crap from the south of the border. I have seen it twice now and I still don't really know what was going on. It had something to do with a stupid look Aztec mummy, a "human robot" that is the stupid look robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is reincarnating some old aztec chick. Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning way by an incredibly boring researcher. This guy is a wonderful sleep aid. His nemesis is a bold hit called The Bat, which is a beautifully imaginative name for an evil scientist. I think the boring scientist and his closest assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife, just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of mummy's girlfriend. They keep the mummy permanently in a mausoleum for some reason, I think the overworking evil guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this because he invents a "human robot" to steal the mummy or attack it or whatever. He is after a treasure that the mummy has, so he can be rich. But excuse me if the guy had this huge intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich in that way? <br /> <br /> Oh, it's supposed to make too much sense. Instead, there is ridiculous struggle between the mummy and the robot, and it is really hard to tell which ones are more or less cheesy. To tell you the truth, I saw this because I believed a movie with a name like The Robot Vs. Aztec Mummy just had to be fabulous cheesy. Instead, it was just dully awful and mind blowing confusing.
