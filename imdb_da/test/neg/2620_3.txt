Now it's a movie I really don't like. It is one of the most boring 90's Horror movies, primarily because it starts slowly and centers in a dull atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eye and do not serve the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The dolls look really cheesy, not in a good way as in the Puppet Master 80's flicks. What did they do with our favorite toys? The story is lame, not interesting, and NEVER really explains the duiker's origin of the puppets. There are no death scenes as in previous films and f / x is terrible. <br /> <br /> I felt asleep the first time I saw it, so I can recommend it to insomniacs.
