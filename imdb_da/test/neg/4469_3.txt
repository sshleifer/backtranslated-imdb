(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie was a huge disappointment. There are so many problems, I don't know where to start. so i want to talk about what's good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The game was amazing. steve martin delivers a really fun performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and the eggs collect, well he plays pretty much himself. add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well. And if you look at these guys for 1.75 hours worth $ 8 for you, then you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the film makes many serious mistakes. First of all, there are enough racist stereotypes and racist jokes to offend everyone. all the white people are busy bigots. All black people are ghetto ebonics speakers. Black is hip, cool, with-it and poor. the whites are nerds, stiff and rich. (apart from eugenic tax, he is clearly taken with queen latifa and "speaks lingo" - so latifa nicknames him a "freak". so - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know street hose you must be a freak). the film is filled with obvious rage against the black cast members and in return, the whites are portrayed as morons and breasts. <br /> <br /> set aside the card, let's look at the big mistake in the movie: they ruin the latifa character. She comes to Martin's home under false sensation, but Martin greets her anyway. she was wrongly accused of robbery, martin raises her case. 3/4 of the way through the film we find out of the latifa's character, which has been escaped from prison. so our sympathy for her goes out the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the movie plows from scene to scene with latifa, which shows up in a place where she doesn't "have to" (like a country club or martin's house) and martin tries to hide her. this is the ongoing gag. so in the last minutes of the film they decide that they will finally deal with the latifa's claim that she was mistakenly charged with bank robbery. Martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract one (let's see the useless) confession from Latifa's former girlfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Finally (but there is much more wrong with this flick) this movie seems to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin film "the house-sitter". where goldie hawn will live with martin and shake his stodgy middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail". the whole "nice nanny dishes rich man's life" goes as far back as "the sound of music" and "mary poppins". <br /> <br /> I didn't want to watch this movie again for free.
