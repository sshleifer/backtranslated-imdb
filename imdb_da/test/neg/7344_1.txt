Was cast and crew of drugs before they started filming this? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled up. From the first scene where the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt about where he was and what he had just done? The excitement was from there. Now it would take another 85 minutes before the mystery was resolved. I have to admit that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours and wondered how stupid the script, director Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea couldn't explain at least how our killer, who was not a lawyer, or a policeman, could go into a locked cell in a prison, kill his second victim and tie him from a nose to make it look like suicide ??? I wondered if I had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how it happened. If anyone can explain it to me, do you ... and then why did he kill the third victim for God's sake? Nothing was sensible ... and yet someone thought that this movie was worthy of being an official selection at a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I failed to laugh.
