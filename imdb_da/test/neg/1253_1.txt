This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It's written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) Production was rushed to saturate poker / Stu Ungar dill. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time on Ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary stories - which count cards, his blackjack escapades, the role of money as id. He also leaves mention of other poker greats like chip reese, brunson etc. The movie is a complete mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
