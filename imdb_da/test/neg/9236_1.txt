All-purpose populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from worst to best. He doesn't care (or has any clue) about art, all he cares about is making people think they have a kick in the groin by watching their movies. The problem is that the effort is too clear, and as events unfold with all the meaningless exaggeration that knelt in them, the effort fails. <br /> <br /> On this "Turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made when it felt very Hollywoodish), Altioklar is trying to be a kind of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you read this, please watch the movie of your life's best comedy!) He doesn't use subtle moves to do it, all he does is use extreme things, and it becomes unbearably absurd and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cow-licked hair is just fun. I hope to meet him personally and ask how he felt about this movie himself. Because I really found the role insulting to him. Demet Evgar groping her genitals was also effortless, and did nothing but make everything look false. Another specific idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% defective tempo setting. When things need to be taken slowly, scenes flow abruptly. And at other times it makes you tired to see the slow ridicule. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so much in love with Hollywood's superficiality, he must use Michael Sixarrows as his name instead. Even such a move would not be half as ridiculous as what he has done on this movie. He should first learn not to imitate instructors whose levels he will never approach, so realize that he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to make the ideas flow into the plot. This useless movie couldn't be saved even by them, but maybe he can make visionary movies in the future by taking these steps. By the way, I've seen some notorious errors like Propaganda and Otostop, and I still can't derive from saying that this was the worst Turkish movie ever.
