El Padrino: The Latin Godfather - while this seems to be a straight two DVD / video type movie - my full frame copy so obviously cropped - so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical round. And the title character seems to be more of a Gringo than moi (I'm half Honduran). Exactly typical increase and fall of a drug dealer movie with the A-list of B-list actors - Robert Wagner (drug law), Kathleen Quinlan (crusader judge), Tiny Lister (mob enforcer), Gary Busey (child murderer), Brad Dourif (white power jailbird), Stacey Keach (robbed governor), Joann Pacula (bereaved Milf), Faye Dunaway (crusading lawyer) and Galo Make Canote as an unredited party guest. This movie is pretty lame - I only saw killing time before the skins game - the only thing that saved it was Jennifer Tilly as a gallic Latin killer killer murder - she was over the top and sexy skanky that it was fun to see her scenes. Not worth renting or looking out. D +
