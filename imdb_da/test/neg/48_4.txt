It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just looked at "The Crime Doctor's Courage" all the way through. It is a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects - each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story begins suddenly and the viewer is thrown into the plot without any sign development or narrative at all. I think it's not too surprising for a B movie during this period. There are also some moments that seem to be before World War II, but this may be due to the author's background in radio programs. "Crime Doctor" is the ghost that happens to visit California for some R&R from its psychiatric practice on the East Coast. He is associated with a mystery writer, friend with whom it is implied, has been together for one or more former mystery-solving hijackers. The author occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our family (AKA Dr. Watson), and occasionally ease things up with a bit of comic relief (kind). There is also a somewhat simple but not entirely bumbling police captain who is sometimes annoyed by the involved sleuth. And then there's the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dancers at a nightclub. The dance is a kind of interpretive dance that seems to be one of the moments that feels more like the 30s than the 40s. Although history is California, Braggas seems to be living in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was a ploth element that managed to keep me a little amused, but I don't want to reveal more than that because I always enjoy movies more when history is discovered, rather than known in advance. (although I can think of many, many, B-movies that would judge higher, and it's hard to say look at this is time spent) I haven't seen other movies from the "Crime Doctor" series so I can There are no comparisons.
