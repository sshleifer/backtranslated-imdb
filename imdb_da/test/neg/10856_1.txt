There are many "bad" movies out there. Set to Channel 5 every night of the week and you can just be treated to a daily shocking action by a filmmaker or someone else. There may be movies that have caused me more pain - were harder to sit through - than this, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, filmography and the film's key foundation. Inbetweeners are a real, really horrible effort and should be avoided at all costs. The only laugh it gave me was in the background movie on the DVD, where the movie's geeky director Darren Fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the talent for the project! Never underestimate the power of the self-driver. <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - UK's answer to Edward D. Wood Jr.!
