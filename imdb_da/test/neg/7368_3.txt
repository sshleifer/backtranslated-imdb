From the title, tag line, plot chart on DVD, etc, I expected something at least a little epic, with the historical fiction and romance that was in keeping with you; That was what they did last of Mohicans for example, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance. But nature was barely ok (how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have such landscapes to work with?), The two lovers had no body at all, and the plot was just so predictable that it felt like it had become prepared in 5 minutes by a twelve-year-old - and not a very imaginative one. Nouvelle-France is a love story in an eventful historical age. But the history of Nouvelle France is hardly a page note, and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer aware of the fate of the men. Surprisingly, the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and unadvised: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (a natural, an adopted). If they had only concentrated on their family and forgot the love story, it would have been a much better movie. Marie-Loup's parents should have been given more screen time and character development, the policy going on in Britain should have been more than a three minute scene with hardly any connection to the rest, the rat baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script altogether (Why do actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs hire them so badly?) Bad work in general.
