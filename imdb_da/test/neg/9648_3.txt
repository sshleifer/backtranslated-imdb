This self-waking, confusing b + w "movie" looks like an infant on a very bad acid trip. You are dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting salad that accidentally fell out of a rubbish bin: no one cares to touch it because it is likely to be washed away alone on the storm drain. There is no room for plot when you have "visceral images" and "subtle" allegory. For me, it seems as if the director is trying to make the next great art film while he begging for intellectual recognition. Nor did I carry my beret. When I saw this, I felt almost offended because the "movie" does such an effective job of distancing yourself from you.
