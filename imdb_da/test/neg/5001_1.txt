I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on a set. <br /> <br /> It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just bizarre, the underlying plot as well. It's lost on me, definitely a walking movie. The only thing that keeps you from going out is the forever unrealized opportunity that it can have some sort of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that all the annoyance of the banal personalities has acted fairly reasonably. But you have to make yourself endless dialogue, which in many cases would like Teach to just close% * & * for a moment.
