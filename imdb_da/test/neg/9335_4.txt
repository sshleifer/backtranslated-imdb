It was only before I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer / star in this movie Tyrone Power died during his production. This undoubtedly explains why everyone on the screen seems to have their opinion on other things, a symptom of which is evident from a very early stage involving a struggle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you painted a wall until you are completely bored? Well this is the kind of expression that the giants have on their face as they swing their swords in a very convincing way. The plot centers on Soloman, King of Israel, who has an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people are not happy about it. You can't really blame them because there are few things more beautiful in the world than the Israeli motives, even though the Israeli women here all look like Cherie Blair! Modern Israel is also very cosmopolitan, where the majority of Israelis are born outside the country, but would have been true a few thousand years ago when everyone speaks in European and American accents. After much talking and a dance sequence to be seen as belief (we are not praised), we have a climax where the highly-superior Israelis must defend themselves against a massaged Egyptian army who cannot read a card otherwise they would have known that there was a canyon in front of them. This is what I don't get - Although their blind by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging against the Israelis never ever realize they are charging towards a gaping gap! Isn't it illogical? It is also something of a manifest error, as horses, wagons and men who fall into the gap are of course miniature figures. Finally, the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you have an idiotic enemy who can't see a gulf in front of him or waves a sword like he is painting a wall?
