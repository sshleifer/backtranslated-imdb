Look no further, this is what the worst movie ever made. There may be others who are bound, but there is no worse. There can't be. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on a clearing laserdisc sale for $ 3.25 and thought no movie with these actors might be worth that price. It turns out it's worth tripling it - at least they should have paid me to see it. I'm almost sure the girl in the picture on the front of the package is not the girl in the movie, they replaced another, someone younger and shorter, to make it look more appealing. Regardless of the "plot", the amount was about three minutes of the actual film, the rest being filler. And I don't mean the kind of filler that you only understand is filler when it's over, or it's a kind of eye disc you don't mind having there, I mean filler that you think of your shopping list. I think the "music" must be made by someone with a friend who had a radio he listened to once. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there was a shot of a lovely mountain, a river valley, a forest, something, there would be something positive about this movie. There is no. Even with the accelerator button on the remote, even at the top laser speed, you can't get it over quickly enough. <br /> <br /> After years of thinking about commenting on movies, tempted but not registered with IMDb I finally broke because I had to do my part to push the user rating on this stink as far as possible . <br /> <br /> The guidelines ask you to "focus on content and context". I can not. There is not enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie has to be much better than striving to be just that.
