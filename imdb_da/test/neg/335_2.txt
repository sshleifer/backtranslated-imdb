I went through a lot of effort to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I really didn't have time to write reviews, but I felt it was my duty as sci-fi horror buff. This is just the second review I have written. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucked. Simple and simple. I wondered if I saw the same movie as those who wrote all those "lovely" comments. I've seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, it's called, and I've seen it. But this really sucked. I don't care how much it costs or doesn't cost to make movies like this, and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the entire casting and crew arrested and imprisoned for time killings. By the way, I mention that this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The reason was not present, and the play was weak. It seems that the author saw Pitch Black and got sad because he didn't think of a plot like this so he decided to make his own ripped version. But instead, the suction factor took over and possessed him. DO NOT SEE THIS. You want more fun if you pull your pants down and sit on burning balls.
