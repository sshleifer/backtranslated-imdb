If you would like to see an example of how not to make a movie, see this. Myself, without film showing, could do better. The script is ridiculous with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. To compensate for this error, you would think the action would be decent, wouldn't you? <br /> <br /> When acting, editing, and overall gambling of the movie is horrible, the only rescue grace is the horrible performance of the main actor. The reason he is the saving grace is because he is so bad at acting that he should win an Oscar for it. At least some recognition to make me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> Toss in a dead woman's body after a male shoot out (where did she come from?), pull the semi-automatic trigger times of times while the soundman draws two shotguns, reflecting the camera's crew in the Kool Mo Dee's nuances, one and only music track for the WHOLE film, an unoriginal script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really, really bad movie. It is actually more fun to spot the mistakes than actually trying to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
