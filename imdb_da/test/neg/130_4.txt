From watching the trailer, the movie looked pretty interesting. The production of the film is also quite good - it seems that they had a good budget and did not look like a cheap movie. The action ranges from good (Joe Morton and Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eva) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the movie is weak. The movie starts as if it could be interesting and ends with a badly executed, disappointingly boring, twist. Seeing the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK, but everything in between makes this a totally boring movie to watch. It is as if they were making a short film, so trying to force it to be over an hour long by filling the center with one hour of filler. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
