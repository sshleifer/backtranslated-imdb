A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided I would finally see it. It was soooooo far. I waited for the excitement to happen, but it never did. I waited for something to happen after the opening scene, and it never did. I stopped the movie and came back later. I forced myself to see the rest of it, hoping it would get better. It got worse. I asked myself who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it. The end would have been better if Dutch died of the shot. At least we would have gotten some feelings from the audience. Or maybe not.
