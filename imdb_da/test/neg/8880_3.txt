I had this DVD to watch and thought I'd see a kind of biography o painter Goya, but the movie was about anything but Goya. This film is about a young woman who was taken away from her family by the sacred Inquisition, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humility, driven by a poor script (can't believe it is by JC Carri√®re, as I couldn't believe this kr ** was directed by Mr Milos Forman) centered on a religious man and the young woman and that's all. <br /> <br /> Ah, and there is Goya, I forgot to play a completely peripheral role - it could be John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or any role. Very disappointing - one of those movies that is forgotten forever (if it hasn't happened yet). Rent "Rose's Name" if you want a movie about the Holy Inquisition. And I don't know what to rent if you want to see a movie about Spanish painter Goya. Perhaps a good caliber director, not Forman, still has to do it. PS: The Spanish painter, Goya - the title role lost in the plot - is depicted by a Scandinavian actor, making this movie even more difficult to be taken seriously. Maybe next time we will send Javier Barden to the biopick of Norwegian painter, Edvard Munch!
