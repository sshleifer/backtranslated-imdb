This is probably the most uninvolving movie I've ever seen. I saw it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else that Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, except for the Wasabi manuscript) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to how bad this movie is, Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortless actors (admittedly he just started here), can't make this movie or the moments when he's on the screen can be seen. br /> <br /> It's all very much movie-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people do things without apparent reason people are chasing each other while being chased by a shaking camera. And predictably none of them is entertaining. It is not a "French food max" that some people have claimed (in fact, I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - it is a superficial comparison based on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic attitude and that is Just the kind of comment you would expect from someone who does not know what they are talking about. Mad Max 2 was vibrant, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it should be cool to like arty black-and-white French movies and just as cool to say you saw something in them that others didn't (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy) ). Therefore, I would not trust anyone who claims to suffer from Le Dernier Combat because I see nothing of the value in it at all; it asks so much and gives nothing back. I found myself driving after approx. five minutes, and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it is not human, or at least is psychotic. (In fact, they're probably just trying to be "cool").
