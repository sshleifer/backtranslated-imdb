This totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout 90 minutes of complete torture I probably looked at my watch about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap, and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. I must admit that the entire audience I was in laughed hysterically, but the majority were Greek or Italian, so I assume that this humor will probably make them laugh, but not me. All this movie does is make you sick seeing all these slackers making excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. God and I can never get it 90 minutes back!
