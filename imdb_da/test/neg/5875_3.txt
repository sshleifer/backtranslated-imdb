A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is a lush one led me to stupidly visit this mid-90s DTV entrance. A child is traumatized when he sees a man's husband hit in the 1950s, and he grows up to be a psychosocial man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) made a career in making porn before this and went straight back to it afterwards. That's what you get to get all the murders on the screen. And to caste a skinny baby as a fat child and make him wear a bold dress. Just throw a barrel of children! There is also a scene where Vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies around him. He was either full and afraid of his life, or the filmmakers caught his "Did I really immerse this low?" shame on. Despite being low budget waste, it was a couple of good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and THE PEOPLE COURT's own Doug Llewelyn. How you can make a boring slasher with the cast is over me.
