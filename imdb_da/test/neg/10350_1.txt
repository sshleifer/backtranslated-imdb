The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why should US producers recreate and destroy another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, It was an absolute masterpiece and it was not necessary to re-insert it. The producers said the British humor from "The Office" and the Australian humor from "Kath & Kim" would not translate into an American audience ......... WHAT ??? So pretty much they say that the Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand the jokes, so they must re-introduce the performances with over-the-top childish gags so that Americans can understand humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is great and very fun. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
