Not a bad concept. I just wished they had taken it in another direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality at first, which works for most people (prudent with weak stomachs). But besides this there is not much in this movie. It's not fun or it's romantic, so please change this label and since I already knew that bestiality is actually legal in most places and a million dollar industry, I wasn't really shocked. But most people don't know, and I thought how the film evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of the shocking eye-opener movies that would teach the ignorant a fetish that really is a reality for (yes I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So if you like to see bad movies that you can daydream about how to make them better while you see them than safe, then fun does.
