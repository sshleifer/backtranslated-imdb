Hideously bad movie allegedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the events that make up the casino life. Moves at the snail's pace. Boring, boring, boring! Almost everything about this movie is amateurish and compelling - with a very remarkable exception: Clive Owen's performance, which is like a Rolls Royce jumping through a slum. Advising the casino sequences was reportedly provided by a professional, but judged by the way they were handled, they were completely ignored by the director. While casino employees may well be another race for the rest of the world, they are not nearly as blurry and booooring as the characters presented in this script. Odds and finishes are thrown into the manuscript in an attempt to provide the convincing background, but appear to have been dropped into a list on a cocktail table. For anyone living in the casino business (as this writer has had in the last FORY years!) This is a poverty depicted by their world, which, even in the extreme and most unclear reach of England, has never been what it wants! A horrible, insulting mess on a movie that plods and plods and plods into an idiotic and unconvincing end. American critics loved it.
