I left the cinema after suffering this movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends attached by a big fat pad to endure the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film's opening order was rolled up, I felt something was wrong and it wasn't long before I stopped myself from hiding under my seat and scaring myself in embarrassment. I am not one to go out of the movies but bad, as they usually have some redeeming features, but this suffered from a catalog of poor conducting, bad action (bore 'Bruno' character and impeccable Jean Rochefort according to my friends) horrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), horrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out of placing the wrong peace of music over the picture and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was its general disobedience and adultery (a result of the above-mentioned atrocities). Why was it so terrible? I will not waste more of my time explaining. I would say go see it for yourself, but I will no longer fill out the boxes of this project more than necessary. Oh, the screening had a redemption function: My friend patted the row of silhouettes with his umbrella raised over his arm as he tried to stabilize - more patos, tensions and entertainment in the few moments than in the 125 minutes this unfortunately grim efforts.
