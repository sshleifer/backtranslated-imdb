This must be one of the worst movies I have ever had the accident to see. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection that hits the planet's ground with EM disruption is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155ºF? The action was so horrible that I got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people out of Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. Frankly, I have seen smaller wooden plays from my ironing board. Sorry, but this movie was poor, poor and poor.
