OK, let me start by saying that this is not a horrible movie in any way. It's just not good. I remember a poster saying that the play is not campy, it's just nuanced. No. I have seen nuanced Japanese and Asian plays. I'm sorry you're wrong. This is camp. <br /> <br /> The characters are completely unsympathetic, the deaths are completely random and completely meaningless. Scripture is bad. I'm fine with suspending disbelief, I'm fine with not having everything given to me with regard to plot. But this movie has no plot. One reviewer said, "This movie is set in a small town where people go nuts over swirls and spirals." It's not a blurb, it's the whole freaking movie. Congratulations, I just saved you almost an hour and a half. There is nothing more to it. No sign development, no plot development, no explanations, no decision. And not even "Acceptable within J-Horror", lack of decision. Just nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical score is made by someone who, of course, does not actually watch the movie at that time because it is coincidental enough to cause whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing, and it does well, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems that the score is designed to go with another movie together. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is, it is as if the Japanese remade Evil Dead without any of the clever bits or good plays. It just falls flat. It is J horror without horror.
