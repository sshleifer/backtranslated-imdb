First Off Acting is so horrible except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show. She should have got Drake and Josh. The only one I like besides Spencer is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He kicked Carly's Crews @ $$ And I liked it <br /> <br /> The episode I hate much is Imyourbigesstfan I hate the young Icaly fan, she made me almost kill myself False is a good word to describe this, please do not see anything on TV, go well with classics like family Let's all go back to Doug Nick Version Only Please Don't See I Hate Icarly Oh Also Nathan Kress is a Wannabee Fredie Highmore
