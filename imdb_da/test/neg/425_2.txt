Oh, I thought it was a good act, but it wasn't. Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to see. Only two matches for nearly 1.5 hours, yak. Many speak and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. The reason is clear from the beginning. If you want a good action, don't rent this movie.
