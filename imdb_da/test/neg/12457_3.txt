"Tart" is a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that wanders around and among a bunch of Manhattan teens exploring all the usual teenage preaches ... sex, drugs, and classical music almost without history, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes while Swain is obliged to work on her way through another on her long list of dog flicks. Nothing in these movies works, and Wayne should consider getting a real job. Not recommended to anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
