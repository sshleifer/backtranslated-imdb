Tamara Anderson and her family move once more, as her ranking painter father is chasing his next landscape. Fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry with her father for their frequent relocations, her anger has worsened when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Her mother's absence causes Tamara to push out with her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, and the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest to an error. It's oddly paced, and even during its emotional scenes, there's no excitement. The actors depicting the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the dead teen's guilty mother. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateurish to wear the movie. The dialogue is very natural, and Boland cannot completely withdraw it. She has her moments, and when she hits them, she can be good, but there were too many times when she came out awkwardly. You can see her thinking 'okay, that's what my line is and it's the face I need to make' rather than reacting to the other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park, when his sister Brenda also suffers from stolen delivery, but at least they are in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done right, you could have made the script an impact film. And it does have moments, but much of it is skewed with an amateur leading executive and flat steering.
