The movie was a pleasure to see if you are a fan of Stooges. The story is told by Moe Howard and his relationship with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The film deals mostly with off-camera highlights and pit falls in Stooges multi-decade career. The director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors that looked like the famous ensemble. The actor playing "Curly" Howard did a great job of portraying the most beloved Stooge on the camera's antics. One must look for any fan of Three Stooges shorts.
