Lately I have seen many westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some good low-budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although it is a spear on this genre, and to me, the one it was made just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can easily be divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is large; it has a large opening scene and an interesting story is developed by a bounty hunter (including the stranger) who goes after a bandit who goes after a large bank transfer guarded, partly by a banker. During the film, these three characters represent changing alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comics for the earlier films' films from this genre, but the comedy does not disturb the overall story. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is where the comedy goes over-the-top and essentially destroys the movie. The turning point is right on the side where the barmaid causally throws the dwarf to stop shooting the customers while waiting for other patrons who are apparently unaware of the four dead bodies lying around. From this point, the film changes from a decent spaghetti vest with comic undertones to a stupid ghost. <br /> <br /> There are three horrible fist scenes (one on the river, one on the market and one at the baths) that follow in quick succession as if you were not bad enough. The fights are so fake, it's ridiculous, and as the sound is out of sync with the picture, it gets even worse. In the market battle scene banks are jumping about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles as he is in the circus; It's clever. Although the worst part of these battle scenes is the music; It is this lightweight, strong mix more suited to a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes are virtually skipping the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western one, but the comics just turned up. If you want to see a good western spoof then see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, avoid this movie.
