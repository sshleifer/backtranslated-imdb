After seeing Stop-Loss, I find myself disappointed with Hollywood to do such a stink. Gone are the days of the movies in the 1940s, which made one proud to be American, and fought the evil that wants to conquer abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribbling on the mouth of healthy anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men returning from the war. You fall into the incredible madness that culminates in his death. The protagonist tells his country in a time of war and destroys his best friendship with his fiance at the same time. The third is truly the hero of history and chooses to continue the battle brought to our shores nearly eight years ago. What makes this movie bad is not the play, but the premise behind it. We lead to believe that decorated soldiers are actually hating in our country. Desertion is akin to treason in a wartime, and the protagonist flirts with the whole movie. This paradox is designed to weaken the audience's response to the film's key action. We must not find fault with King when he bears medals, but his actions do not merely deserve it, but weep for it. He is not an anti-hero. To accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion, because the story paints the king as nothing but a hero. I cannot accept it as it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. In addition, the real hero, the man who re-lists and continues to serve his country, is split up. I would only recommend this stink to anyone who needs conviction about Hollywood's decay as it is a clear example of that. No wonder it went bad in the box office.
