All the big horror movies from the 70s, 80s, and even the early 90s from Psycho, to Texas Chainsaw Masacre (the original not heated over WB crap) to Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these films were based on Ed Gein's crimes. The authors and directors tapped into the true story to inspire to create some of the greatest * fictional * film-makers from all times. The old horror films were great, because even though the crimes were loosely based on the facts of Ed Gein's case, they were really fictional and far from the true story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this movie, they have created a fictitious horror movie where they attempted to capitalize on the true story of selling a cheap, ill-acted, love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. In fact, in a * good * horror movie, these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> Completion of lectures ... In short, this movie was wearing a clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit.
