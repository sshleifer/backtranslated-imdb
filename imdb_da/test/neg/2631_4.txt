I happened to catch this supposed "horror" flick late on a Friday night, I wish I went to bed! Tell me .. Is a 3 ft high raincoat clad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some kind of fear? Not here, but Mi-low is still able to turn the wrist out of the caretaker (Antonio Fargas), who is three times his size (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so pitiful ... it just lets you hang with nothing to go on anything! I found myself asking, "Is that it ???" <br /> <br /> It's about as good as it comes in a low cost movie. The aforementioned Fargas provide a decent performance; but it is my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worse actresses ever to enter Tinsel Town! Safe, sweet face, but bad acting. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
