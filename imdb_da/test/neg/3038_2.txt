The original WASC is by no means a must see movie in the genre. In fact, it would be no logical reason to see it if it failed for the first 25 minutes. Remake takes the 25 minutes and makes them a mediocre 85 minute teen Horror flick. <br /> <br /> Now, I don't mind PG-13 Horror movies, but the trend around them is getting lame. When you see the PG-13 rating you expect a movie filled with fake fright, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used several times. Don't even ask for gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it's not right to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of ​​the new one is based on the beginning of original. The tension that is felt through the first film is not present in any way in the remake. Not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning. No voltage, voltage, voltage ... nothing. The movie goes too slow before it gets a little "interesting" and that is when the stranger appears. The chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there is a sense of "what will happen next?". But it is. The situations created for the climax are predictable, boring and lacking in tension. The original has the merit of having excitement in the main scenes, and also for a chilling climax for the main scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this is a PG-13 Horror movie, but if you pay respect for the original. Why change it is the most important situation? The children should not survive! After the end, I felt that this movie was meaningless. So baby sitter played cat and mouse with a wacko ... that's it? Then the sequence in the hospital was simply stupid. And worst of all, it means that a successor may be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best thing about the movie. She delivers a sweet, credible performance. She needs to choose better projects, although this role will win for her thousands of teenage friends. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie. Some people say that in order to support the Horror genre, we must support any movie that comes out. I don't have to agree. If we ignore movies like WASC, Horror movie producers will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good Horror movies, not lame flicks filled with fake horror. <br /> <br /> See the original "When a Stranger Calls" instead of being the first 25 minutes far better than the whole (meaningless) remake.
