Think of an extremely low rental version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad." It sums up the girl in a nutshell. I need to give credit where credit is due. The film has a good visual appeal to it. I liked movies, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume design. But without good acting, a movie has no redeeming value. I'd rather watch a movie with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (ie "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out as if they are in a bad soap opera. That's why I'm not doing the most common actors. Let's see, most ordinary actors are common to a reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he resumes dialogue as if he were reading it from the side? It's a shame because the director looks as though he knows his stuff when it comes to miss a scene (sp). At the same time, I can't really praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the manuscript, which contains a terrible dialogue. He can also be a bit racist as well, as there is a black principal in the film, which is in the culmination of African American stereotypes.
