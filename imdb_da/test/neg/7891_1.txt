This is a movie about a black man who buys an airline and turns the business into an African centered over the top airline. They even portray the owner as he not only controls the airline but also controls part of the airport terminal at the airport. One day, this guy wins $ 100 million a next time you see him, he crosses the airport, which acts as the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie shouts parody! This movie is a flop and will forever be in the $ 4.95 bin at Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can't even understand why MGM would spend $ 16 million on this movie. This movie does not even guarantee straight-to-video status. The authors (a black and a white) should be blackballed from Hollywood forever. Not only do they exaggerate stereotypical blacks, they portray them as ignorant people. I was ashamed to go to a film that constantly humiliates me. Don't waste your time in the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view or a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS.
