The MTV sci-fi animated series "Ã†on Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron, who plays the title character, a freedom fight fighting oppression in the mountainous town of Bregna, 400 hundred years in the future. For her recent mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she reveals secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls into the category of good condition, mediocre execution. Interesting story, but the movie was a bit boring. Many people say this is one of the worst movies of the year, and that is not true at all. It may be a disappointing movie, but at best it's an average movie. I've never seen the cartoon version of the movie, so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not so confusing, but it is easy to lose if you are not familiar with the material. The action was okay, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and is dedicated to the movie. The rest of the cast also gives decent performances, including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the movie, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it is taking too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the film, and it becomes a bit tedious. There is no humor, and the movie sometimes becomes a bit boring. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the movie is so serious, the dialogue sounds cheesy and serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but it's not about the movie, so don't go in for just an action movie. Twist at the end does not mind blowing, but it is still a good ending and better than other thrillers who have come out in the past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a little strange, but still look nice and interesting. The visions were also well done, so the film looks good at least. Then the film can be a case of style over fabric. Interesting to look at, but not keep your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best movie out there, but it can be a decent rental. Rating 4/10
