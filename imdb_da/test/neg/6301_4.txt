This is one of the unofficial and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you like them more. But like so many others, the material is not strong enough to happily fill a few hours. The place is promising: three dragons drive a bus through Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into lots of trouble - with the homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. The real problem is with the dialogue. The wires are fine (although Pearce's continued camp becomes tiresome), but one-liners and epithets feel compelled to be thrown away at random. Characters should not laugh at their own gags. Writer / Instructor Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasantly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against powerful desert backgrounds such as so inexpensive makeup. For a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.
