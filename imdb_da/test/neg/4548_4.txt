The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. And when you see cower art for this movie of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's how I fed this movie. But boy, was I in for a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love B movies. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little movie about zombies, monsters, murderers, that kind of thing. But to say that this movie was missing is an understatement. This movie was a clean trash can. You would think the zombies would look a bit like the box's cover art shows, but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold on a Halloween counter. In addition, the script is beyond pathetic. Our protagonist, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the warm-hearted Mary, played by Blair. Not even do you see any sign of grief or discomfort in Joseph's character. Instead, we see the leader of the cryogenic labs, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their bodies. There is no emotion or anything to make you think you should confuse anyone in this movie. Everything and everything, very disappointing. All the elements to make a big horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and a little if any sense of direction turned this one up royal. Overall 4 out of 10
