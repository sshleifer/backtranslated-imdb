Terrible, horrible, horrible times one hundred still do not begin to describe how crazy "Biggest Loser" is. Picture this: Take two cool couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on premium TV. Am I the only one who thinks this is not a people with IQs in the 3-digit area WANT TO WATCH? Everything needs forever, with lumps of lard whirling about how losing weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Do they break if we care? Probably not. I think I want to videotape yourself to make crunches and sell it to some big TV companies. If this passes to TV, it can also be my training!
