First, I am a great Bronson fan who has been since the late 70s. I watched all the movies he made on the big screen since "Love and Bullets", which ironically was the start of his end as a big name, Hollywood blockbuster star. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that things would be around for him to make a really good movie in the 80s, but it never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hacked director J. Lee Thompson for most of his last movie. "Assasination" gave me some hopes when I saw what Peter Hunt stood for Thompson, but those hopes were quickly dashed. Firstly, the film looks unreliable cheaply, as if it was made in about 3 miles minus Bronson's inflated wages (I heard he insisted on 5 miles per picture that is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his gun movies) . The White House scenes were filmed on VA grounds in West LA - I took the bus as they shoot. Good work to recreate the white house, but no one thought of getting the palm out of the shots? Don't guess. <br /> <br /> Second, the support molding is really bad. Ireland died of cancer and despite this she is not bad, but the terrible Asian woman playing Bronson's sidekick was typical of Canon's talent at the time - non-existent. I would be really curious to learn how she got this role. I can't imagine a worse actress for that part, plus she's a good 40 year younger than Bronson! The story is not that bad, and it's something like bigger and better budgeted studies later (Eastwood's "In the Fire of Fire" and Costner's "Bodyguard" movie), but the way it's staged here is really sad. I wonder if they can't afford to do more than one or two shots per shot. None of it is credible at least. If Secret Service men really acted as the keystone police in this movie, we would have presidents rotating out of the office (and out of life) every few months ...
