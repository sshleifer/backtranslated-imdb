So, Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher, who lost his partner for a surprise surprise drug survey, Colombia! Not to brag or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (therefore my last name), and now he is a doctor in California, so no matter what the movies would have you believe, there are other things than drug dealers and cocaine coming out of Colombia! <br/> <br /> In any case, in a drug settlement, Badcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute and inspires him to go to confession, a place I've never seen him go before any of his films, sooner or later. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal tends to come out as almost asexually the way he never gets much involved with other women than as a plot entity, and the way, occasionally seduction attempts, either by a stripper or by a lover, never piques the slightest interest Hi M. He's all the de-bad people all the time. <br /> <br /> But in the confirmation box he admits having lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (I hope I don't come into trouble with God by telling you this?). The pastor tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to retire from the power. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization characteristics of Seagals film. Market For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of mysterious Jamaican drug dealers, and these men have no discretion to push their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher goes back to visiting his old high school coach, Max (a minimal effort by Keith David), and in the midst of practice, there are some of those terrible lock holes that are right there in the ink. who throws on some masked girls. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just had a protected high school experience, but I didn't know crack dealers and crackheads hung out at school in the middle of the day. In any case, it is not long before Hatcher learns how bad these guys are. They do not just like children in high school, but the coaches have lost football players regularly to their drugs, they engage in smartass stare-downs with Max, and since that is not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. <br /> <br /> Ah, OK. We get the picture. I'm sure they also torture puppies and look up old women, and maybe even steal candy from kids, just for good measure. Is it really hard to determine who the evil ones are? 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. The film not only knows how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to the movie name, where evil deeds are made assigned to them through dialogue, but they also do not know how to act. <br /> <br /> The head of the drug dealers is called Screwface, and I suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie it is. Screwface is a cartoon-like Jamaican man with these bright, bizarre green eyes, which I guess should be an important part of his character, because he uses a large majority of his screen time with his eyes half bent off his head. His favorite values ​​are screaming really loudly in his wildly blown-out Jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from the one he shouts at. This guy likes to get into guys faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses do not touch. All I could think of was how the poor boys would handle his breath. Man, they don't want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican, by the way. Their accents are so exaggerated and overwhelmed that most of the movie is almost impossible to understand. Not that it matters. No matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is a kind of evil-related thing, they are just psychologists who throw drugs and kill people. The movie must have been a big hit in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that the theaters, especially the evil ones I have described, are spectacularly yummy, even for a Seagal movie. They are so cartoon-like and strange that it is impossible to take them as anything but a goofball-b-movie creation, something merged to give way to who Seagal can distribute his distinctive brand of smack-down retribution. <br /> <br /> But there is also a bizarre black kind of mystery in the movie that just makes everything come out as weird. For example, a mystic, you suppose you would call her, at one time puts some kind of curse on the Screwface (if I remember correctly) spit mouth-wateringly on Bacardi on a live rooster hanging on his head before pouring It and drips the blood on a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same woman warns Hatcher that his family has been "marked to death" by these people, meaning they have some voodoo hex on them. Not to hurt anyone, but if I was told that my family had been cursed by humans, I would just laugh at it. Hatcher doesn't hit me like that kind of guy taking much stock in freaky voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> But the setup you see is quite standard for a Seagal movie. Unique villains, I think you could say, even though it is not very impressive. Absolutely the weird movie of Seagal's early career ??
