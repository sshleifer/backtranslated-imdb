Yes this movie has a madman named Jessica who says everything is bad and she causes trees to land on humans too (well she only makes a tree fall once, but she says everything is bad). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms for people, but offers a little bit more in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick, and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course, they do not know this before the owner of the farm's helpers opens the box with his head. The head continues to hypnotize everyone it can so it can come to Jessica and use her powers to find things that help look for his body. This movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays very badly here. Everyone in this flick will come on your nerves at least once.
