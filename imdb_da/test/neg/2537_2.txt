Abysmal Indonesian action movie from legendary Arizal triumphantly tells a template for future Cinemax cardboard such as 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while burying the badly rising action star Pat O'Brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair styling gel for perm his impressive 1984 mullet. This guy's physical skill resembles a more feminine Mark Gregory, and his next credit would be second fiddle to Chris Mitchum as "Tom Selick." Powerful. At least, the action is mindless and non-stop with some bold Asian stuntmen who risk their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed film of teens and / or meth-infected people without a concept of reality. A bad extra gets the gorno-ly cracked by an electric hedge trimmer and many more are killed by getting in the head of odd objects like a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteful and invaluable and quotable dialogue like, "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" comes with such indulgence and joy from the triple police scholars. Random highlight: A little crazy guy eats live lizards. Film also contains the plate for most cars driven through walls. 2.10
