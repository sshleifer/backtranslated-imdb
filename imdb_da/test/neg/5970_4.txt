My mother and I went to watch this movie because my brother is serving in the US Peace Corps in the same region where it is set. Halfway through the movie, I decided that in view of its inability to measure up to what it claims to do, the title is pretentious. The subject it was about could have made an excellent documentary, but because of the bad execution it sounded much less educated about the problem than I had hoped to stay. I agree with Laura-jane from Canada ("Powerful Message but lacking focus"). I also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker's narrative style is the opposite of Michael Moore, but I do not agree that it presents various views and encourages viewers to decide for themselves. I agree with a user's comment that "a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves"; But our conclusions cannot be anything but badly founded if we are presented with some relevant information from which they can be drawn. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentaries seemed to be 1) The African people living near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot. 2) The introduction of perch to Lake Victoria, inflicted by Europeans, destroyed its ecosystem. 3) The communities around Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the movie is that it attempted to relate to the prospects of the average people in sub-Saharan Africa who unfortunately are an anomaly among movies and that it was trying to portray poverty as a result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony it caught in the massive amount of fish that left the country in the face of a famine. I appreciated the depiction of the disgrace of the UN team assigned to the region by the people. Like almost all documentaries who do not have the word "women" in the title, this film fails to do a good job representing women's voices - the majority of the speakers in interviews are men's. <br /> Perhaps I should watch the movie once to get some key points I might have missed, but I failed to discover Sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to Lake Victoria and the unfair living conditions of Africans living near the lake. Besides, I could be wrong, but it struck me that Sauper could do well to improve his interviewing skills. Not only did the questions he asked and the answers he included seem arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real opportunity to make interviewees awkward and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most convincing development of the film is the proposal that perch exports now serve to dampen the introduction of weapons, and that real economy is swept over Tanzanian's war, not fishing. Unfortunately, sauces look away from performing a thorough exposure of the idea (or at least expanding the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about with regard to the arms import) and cops out with a "self" approach. <br /> <br /> If Darwin's nightmare was supposed to remove the myth that first world exploitation of the Third World gives them "a chance for a better life," it did not do a good job. If it were supposed to portray how the arms industry in the US and Europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world, it did not do well. If it were meant to portray what drives people to prostitution, it didn't do a good job with it. If it were supposed to highlight U.N.'s inability to perform his mission, it did not do a good job. If it was supposed that the modest income that the Tanzanians earn from perch is not worth the human cost of thinking with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, it did not benefit from it. If that were to mean that Tanzania would be much better, Europeans had never come, it didn't do well.
