Love the TPBs, but it was a lame episode. Don't have the same feeling that the series or movie has. Looked like it was put together in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called play was terrible. The cast seemed as though they knew it was a pocketbook of an episode to get to the market quickly. I hope we don't have an Easter special next because it will be for me. The writing of this episode was certainly Mike Clattenburg's worst in this show's story. The direction left much to be desired, and I almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a Christmas deal. As I said, I love the TPBs, but this one goes to the trash.
