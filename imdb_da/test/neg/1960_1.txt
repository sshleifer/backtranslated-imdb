Please, if you are thinking of renting this movie, do not. If you're thinking of seeing a few downloaded clips, don't. If I had my way, no one would even have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> Despite being one of the highest points in the movie, the action was still pathetic. The director was likely a sadist. The witty one liners were something one might expect from a room of highly-paid antisocial 7-year-old who eats paint chips for breakfast. The problem with this movie is that it's trying to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (under no circumstances associate these 2 movies) because it's so bad it's fun. But it also tries to be fun at the same time and fails so overwhelmingly to make your sense of humor crippled to do anything but stave off your gag reflex in a mockery to save. <br /> <I could continue much more and detail just how terrible it really was, but I think it would remove me from my will to live just to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I'll be trying to cook myself so I can feel clean again ...
