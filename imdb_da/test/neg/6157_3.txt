The story and the characters really really need work. The world idea is kind of nice, but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exhibition or through the plot. Despite the cheese observations at the beginning of the movie, it makes sense that you will not use the exhibit as no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) leave and get lost and are introduced to wine growers and the fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we don't get any real idea of ​​who these people are, or why we should worry about any of them. Smartfilm has ways to develop this by just having the characters live in the world. Simple things like ordering a drink in a bar or talking about something in the past - these are the kinds of things that make the movie world memorable, not endless shots of crappy plans and cheap CG effects by anyone trying to loop in an ultrasound. <br /> <br /> If this is too difficult for you, it is a small tip - down several places. If everything is getting uneven, because you pull up too often, you have to be in a place for a while and get the characters to talk a little. All superfluous crap must be removed. Relax with the entire wine growers scene. Relax the heavy museum people. Get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Have the whole set put on a big plane, or something. Just get people talking about something we're interested in. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Has the film center around Tasker character and his relationship with the robot, Byron. The biggest problem with the movie is that we don't care about anyone because nobody takes the time to either explain their motivations or dive into their characters. We don't like Matt (well, because he's played by Bill Paxton, among other things). He is a scoundrel who doesn't solve himself enough, except to let Android, Byron go. And this action is even less important than most because of three main points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a killer. 2. Byron is indestructible. Byron can leave the time when he is fine. <br /> <br /> We're trying to like Byron because there is some kind of pathos there, but it's pretty much undeveloped. All we are left with is a whiny, glassy-eyed robot guy who acts is subdued and tree for a moment, and almost zany the next. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but we know for a fact that he has killed someone. We do not know why he murdered anyone or the circumstances of this pigs event because it was not developed. We cannot be pampered for him if we do not know the story. All we know for a fact is that he is killing people. And he likes Bill Paxton. We do not hate Bags enough (partly because he is played by the goodman Mark Hamill) when he is gruff and ruthless, does nothing beyond his character - a post-apocalyptic peace officer. Sure he is killing Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers on the way to growing poppies for heroin. And they shoot at him first. He does not kill anyone who does not get in the way or who does not physically hurt him first. It goes just as well to the final confrontation in the museum. He uses an avenue of police force against a lazy dilettant (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else pulls a gun at him. I really don't understand what is about Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner. After only 10 accumulated minutes with Matt, she is ready to change pages, despite her cry for loyalty, and despite Matt's garbage game and cheating on her. If it's love, then I choose to hate one day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is about as lovable as Simon in "True Lies" or Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Is there anyone who falls for him in these movies? No why? Because he is a high-spirited idiot and a loser. Why put him in the helm of this movie?
