There was not much thought put on the story on many fronts. This is a good action movie, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film says that lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who do they protect the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing but peasants. <br /> <br /> - My understanding is that vampires are immortal and not age. Nevertheless, ages Sonya from child to adult. Do they just stop aging for a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was reversed (as explained in the second film). But vampire babies age? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I didn't realize that vampires needed torches to watch at night. Yet we see those who carry torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only one that was supposed to damage the lycan. But the wooden sticks fired from the large crossbars also kill the lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that show a lack of thinking in history.
