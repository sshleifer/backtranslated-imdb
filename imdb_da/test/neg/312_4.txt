On Halloween, a city is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin to the head. Bad action compromised for the most part by local talent and ridiculous special effects make this one baaaaad. B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley looks embarrassed to be part of this and even her great charm that has helped so many of her other movies cannot help this one. Pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good Halloween horror movie and rent "Night of the Demons", also stars fr. Quigley.
