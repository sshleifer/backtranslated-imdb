When this show is first broadcast, I will admit to being fascinated by the premise and the setting. With an open mind I saw the first two episodes and of course rejected it as intended to run for a half season at most. I happened to see A / E recently and saw an ad for this waste and I could hardly include my surprise. I really hope people see this for a laugh and don't take it seriously. The characters are really some of the most ridiculous and quite scary on television, scripted or otherwise. Of course, these are generating ratings, so I have to give the creators credit to establish and maintain a fan base, but I seriously hope that no one sees this under any kind of seriousness.
