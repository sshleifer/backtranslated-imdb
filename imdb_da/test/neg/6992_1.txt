Everyone loves to see a really bad movie sometime. You see it, take a good laugh and forget it for the next half hour. But this is not one of them. It is the worst thing that will look forward to your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I want to see someone take responsibility for Dante - he's really the stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants talking to a voice over and having a victory laugh like and 50's Dracula. How can anyone come up with this guy ?? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or anything ... my corn box has better acting skills than him (maybe all of them), it's incredible. But the worst is the battle situation, where you think there might be something in it. They are so boring, it is without any kind of description. There is no shame, I just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any study. But I'm just excited about it. Seeing this is a self-defeating pleasure. Just watch this if you are in a movie that is looking for pain, and then this is a sure winner.
