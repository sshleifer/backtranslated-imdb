This was a sad and boring mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes like this - some socialites are murdered, and a woman murder detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian community, and she turns to an associate who may have relevant information. Since detective is an attractive woman, she is, of course, horny and fascinated (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). Surprisingly, none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky. Ellen Barkin gives a respectable performance as a leading detective, and Julian Sands gives unintentional grin as a cross-dragon psychiatrist, thus avoiding a star rating.
