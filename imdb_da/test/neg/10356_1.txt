I'm a fan of this overall excellent, but sometimes quite boring show, but Season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions. The episode HERO is an example of what I mean. The story that it eventually removes is that Cylons deliberately allow the Bulldog - a pilot captured several years earlier under a black ops mission - to escape, steal a Cylon ship and return to Galactica. The plan is that when the Bulldog comes back, he will figure out that Adama left him to his fate and be so furious that he will kill Adama as he almost does. <br /> <br /> Now, the problem is this Cylons set it up so Bulldog thinks he's run away from himself. This means that the Bulldog comes out of the Cylon ship without help. So he kills a Cylon and goes out of his team cell - as much as we see. Then we have to assume that he goes to the airport hall, manages to enter a Cylon combat ship and learn to drive it, depart and fly back to Galactica. Just like that. <br /> <br /> Now, Starbuck managed to get one of them to work in season 1, which at least was not credible in itself, but she only had to fly it out of orbit before contacting Galactica. . Bulldogs have to program their ship so that it makes more jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch Galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction. How does he manage to program a ship that contains completely foreign technology? Cylons connect their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And how has he managed the miraculous feat, how does he know where Galactica is, as Galactica took off some 3 years before and is ever trying to evade the Cylons - it does not leave the hills behind? Even allowing the suspension of unbelievers to apply to a sci-fi show, this episode is still absolutely no sense at all.
