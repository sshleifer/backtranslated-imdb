This series continues to frustrate and annoy. How are they going to pull it out in another year? Each episode offers more and more questions, while responding to very few. To quote another very popular site, I think this show has now jumped the shark! <br /> <br /> Will I watch it? <br /> <br /> Are they likely to be able to keep the show in the air until it ends? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... How have two qualified doctors failed to notice that Naomi was still alive? How did 30 plus people not notice a body wake up and get rid of a knife still in the back? How has anyone had enough strength to create two paths and climb a wood in ambush Kate? <br /> <br /> We have now introduced a ghostbuster ... Same time next week? Yep!
