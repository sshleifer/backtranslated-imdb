After the movie representing the top of the 1980's ninja genre, 'anointed fans' Revenge Of The Ninja was 'treated' to this bizarre offer that blends Ninja Shenanigans with spiritual possession .... for that somewhat awful experience when you spy a nugget human poop that floats violently against itself in a public swimming pool. Take e.g. the supposed "action packed" introduction set at all places on the golf course! the superficial elitist attitude adopted by many participants in this sport annoys me even though ... hmmmm maybe that's why he murdered them? ..... yes I can relate to it after all). In fact, later in the film, we are told that one of the golfers was a top researcher, but this story line is never elaborated or pointed out to ever again !!! <br /> <br /> At least back to the intro, the police continue to enclose the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin .... and they must continue shooting him because he just won't stay down! !! Yes, literally hundreds of rounds are being pumped into him, and he is increasingly killing law enforcement numbers. Finally (according to what seems like an eternity), our miscreant detects a smoke bomb and disappears ... ... or it actually seems that he is actually just hiding under the ground and at our related gormless officers leaving the scene to search his body, he crawls out and hides away. <br /> <br /> The next time we see the lovely Lucinda Dickey, a really beautiful actress and in great fit physical condition, here is a phone repairman. From her high vantage point, it is random to see the dying (last week !!!!!) ninja. But on closer examination, the man on his last leg suddenly jumps over her and grabs her to the ground. After a bit of a struggle, our feeble heroine succeeds in breaking free, but does not count on the ninja who has hypnotic powers and she inevitably yields to them. It is at this time that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use his bodily form to kill the officers who killed him (the few he was actually unable to eradicate originally!) <br /> <br /> From that point on, throughout the movie, when our heroine stains one of the aforementioned officers she is exposed to some overwhelmingly horrific biographical scenes with flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja brought to her levitating against her in a most wobbly manner! <br /> <br /> Making matters more complicated, a particularly annoying police officer (who has enough sports back and shoulder hair to shake an average yak!) continues to try to win her feelings (on a most bloody annoying way !!!) Well of course it does not take the prerequisite gift to prepare it in a rather weak "shock" (less) twist at the end of the movie, he is revealed to be one of the officers she must kill! <br /> <br /> But wait, there is still hope! <br /> <br /> Continue the only and only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja himself and look here as cool as ever! Of course, the golf club news travels quickly and after learning the aforementioned events that occurred there, he flies all the way from Japan to sort out the situation (suspicion of the worst!) In a short sub-story (it equals every few seconds!) Sho's interest in this particular ninja has been shown to be personal after that villain has shown to have murdered Sho's father / teacher (?) and blinded one of Sho's eyes (so that Sho must wear a really decorative-looking sword-protecting eyelid!) having stolen his dead neighbour's body from the chest and then tracing our heroine who provides an ignorant stay for the evil soul, there is something that stands in an oriental temple (apparently in the middle of the sky) where our husband Sho manages to reunite the two aspects. <br /> <br /> Now resurrected from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho challenge it in traditional ninja style with swords, where the winner gets ........ well yes you can guess. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie has only two things going for it, the always excellent cougar (which looks amazing in the role as always) and the lovely Miss dickey. What a shame that the material they found in here is such a sharp pile of endurance. <br /> <br /> Oh, to be fair, I've seen much worse than this in my time, though I certainly still can't recommend this other than those desperate to complete their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections.
