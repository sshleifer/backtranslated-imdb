Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies are dependent on human torture to scare people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder is trying to get you scared and scared. This movie does just that, but not in a good way. Now there are some moments in the movie where there is a chance that Snyder saves this movie from falling into a hole, but let's be honest, this movie did not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Sins do no attempt to get out of it. When you finish watching this movie, you're back sick, depressed, dirty and insane. I have a feeling that it was the intention of this movie. What is lower than dirt?
