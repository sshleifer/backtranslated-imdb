The atmosphere of this show is amazing. There is plenty of excellent build, but that's where this show fails. There is way to much build for nothing. You will constantly see a creepy set that makes it feel that something really freaky comes right out of the corner and then .... nothing. Over and over again nothing. You hear lots of stories about people talking about freaky events, but you see no one. They show up on these people's doors, talk about their deep and emotional past, create lame equipment and find nothing! There is nothing on this show that leads me to believe in anything paranormal. I laugh every time they need to exercise a "terrible spirit" that we as an audience have not seen. They get rid of the spirit that was never, and everything is put in a nice little package. A show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
