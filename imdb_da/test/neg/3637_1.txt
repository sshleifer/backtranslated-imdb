For any fan of Nickelodeon who used to see the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good at it. You had entertaining actions that you can't do on television. You had strange but good shows like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morality like Doug. But like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen into the tubes, limiting their demographic to superficial preteness and giving us bad excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. When I tried to see Zoey 101, I just shot my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The setting could not have been more false than this one. Each character participates in a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, which offers everything a pampered child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in each room, cold dorms to hang out, etc. The kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there seems to be no real teachers. It looks more like a place you would spend on a good summer vacation instead of working and studying while preparing for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that struck me off. Each episode consists of boy problems, situations they have caused themselves, and problems to be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) works perfectly in everything she does and each of her friends asks for help when they feel they are in serious danger. Only leads her to have no other side. I've been through school, and I can tell you no one is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays the arrogant hard guy. Quinn plays a geek who is very unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just good, a hard person. Why not use some originality? Something unique to these characters, and different from other personalities? Is stereotypically the best that creators of this show can come up with? Instead, these actors are boring personalities in the sense that lacking creativity involves their roles. There is nothing here to be amazed or surprised. Not only that, but the show is clearly intended to target children in adolescence and face a stage in which they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. Throughout this period, they must learn to study alone, make their own decisions, and do what suits them. Zoey 101 contains none of these values. In this case, we must believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. I'm sorry, but it's simply not true. People can't expect things to be handed over to them, just as the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. If I expect things in Zoey 101 to happen in real life, then I will be living in a fantasy world that is locked away in a dream home. Nothing in this show concerns those who face health and money problems. It is also not related to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> Thus, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that only falls flat on the face. It shows a terrible message to children, and I think very much that the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to get a child to act and look stupid. A horrible show and should be forgotten with the rest of the waste Nickelodeon has made in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
