My friends and I rented this movie wrong for someone else on skateboarding. Watchin Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is fun. The movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a laughter party. Although I gave it a 1/10, this movie should be watched especially if you manage to capture it on TV anywhere.
