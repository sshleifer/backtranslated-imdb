Number 2 is best summarized by Jeff Goldblum in the movie about being the stupid idea in the story of stupid ideas (or something like that). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is the death budget ... JP has achieved everything ever will. <br /> <br /> When they realized they didn't have any new ideas, they should just have let sleeping dinos lie. <br /> <br /> It said.
