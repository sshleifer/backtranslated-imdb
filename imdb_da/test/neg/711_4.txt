OK, so it's not good either, but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this movie got a total overhaul, improved the picture quality, added new duplicate to the badly duplicated voices and added a nice discreet background music, then this movie would really start to take shape. As it is, it has problems. People change it for how old the boys look. Quel surprise! they were in their 60s and had led a 'life'. But for me, they still stood to have bucketful charms, and while not even close to wedging their classic feet (I gave it a 4), it's worth looking at, simply because it's them. Thinking otherwise would be unfair !!
