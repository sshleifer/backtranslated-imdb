This movie is a real low budget production, but I don't want to say anything more about what it has already covered. I give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but I met the director the night I watched the movie and he gave me another reason not to like the movie. He asked me how I enjoyed it, and I told him it was not easy to suffer. My main objection was the lack of basis for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced they were close. I also told him that the scene, where the protagonists were presented as children, became friends, was too late in the film. He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. That they were added because he felt I was doing it, the two main characters did not seem close. He went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction when they were out of money. I agree that they didn't do much for the movie. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the movie I didn't know about is the actor who had the lead, wrote the script based on his own personal experience. This is usually a bad move as some authors do not take into account the emotional response viewer. The story is so close to home that the author makes too many assumptions about the audience's reaction to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. It didn't work for me though, as I never cared about any of the characters, at least of the head. What was presented was two evil people out to make money in any way, no matter who gets hurt. When Mrs Young's character decides to abandon his evil ways, she seems to do so because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. If the movie has a message, I suppose only the author is aware of it.
