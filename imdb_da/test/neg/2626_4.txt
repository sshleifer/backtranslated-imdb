"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama in the second Japanese war prison camp in World War II. The story cuts between past events and today's day, where the old veterans are planning a reunion. This is a very published and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget ran out ($ 6.5 million Aust Dollars); Historians and veterans criticized their authenticity; and critics pilloried the troubled mix of comedy and drama (shades of "Pearl Harbor"). Series author John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy team) has tried to defend himself with "the characters are composites of real people"; "the troops used comedy to cope with the situation"; "it is based only on actual events"; "One of our actors was actually there" etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many fantastic fictional and factual dramas have come out of the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Paradise Road", "Sun Empire", "Blood Eath" and "A Town Like Alice". Black comedy has often been used successfully in P.O.W dramas: "Life is Beautiful", "The Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "The Colditz Story" and even "Hogans Heroes". So why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - The action in "Changi" is uniformly excellent, music and movies are good - that's the writing and direction that has knocked it down. Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, I thought, "Don't I see Alec Guinness doing this in" Bridge on the Kwai River "?". The sudden flashes of surreal song and dance brought Dennis Potter's "Singing Detective" back, but without the subtlety. This borrowing happened so often, it tasted of lazy writing by cutting and pasting, rather than tribute. The constant interconnection between past and present-day stories did not allow me to concentrate on it either. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from signs where intensity was required. "The company" is exaggerated - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody crows" and so I said "I get points, I know they are Aussies". Cultural stereotypes extended to the British and Japanese also-Canadian young Japanese officer; uptight British officer; wiser Japanese commander; fun loved, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I saw "Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai". After 3 episodes, I'm tuning out.
