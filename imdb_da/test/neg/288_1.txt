QUESTION: How does a movie deserve two different titles such as "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The film is soooooooooooooooooooooooo not even able to decide on a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death desires-vendettas, melodrama, romance and other clich√© movie techniques. The story focuses on a vigilant group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a scary, multilingual, pockmarked creature named Marco (Andrew Divoff), who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this movie and his scene is completely out of action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest threads I've ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of pervert imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather." <br /> <br /> Also in this movie is Erika Eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kick-boxes into an alliance with Simon. The librarians and the Erika become a powerful strike force against evil in a movie that has been delivered directly from the editing room of your cable TV conversion box.
