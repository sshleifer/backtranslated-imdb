When I first saw "Race Against Fear" (Don't you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to continue scratching my head. Was it supposed to be serious? Why couldn't the protagonist run like a normal person who is driving, much less like a star runner? How did I know the coach was evil, just 1 minute in the movie? All these questions and no answers. Then I just let the inane script and the horrible rule just carry me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became more fun a minute, and I now classify it among my top 10 junk movies from LMN. Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but the material was defective - I disagree with disagreement. Not only can she not convince me that she is an athlete, she goes wide-eyed through the rest of the story, as if she's just come to earth. Maybe the coach broke out of the prison and ended her ... at least I hope so.
