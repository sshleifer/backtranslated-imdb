The growth of tax funds and sales and lease backlogs has led to a series of opaque films that collect dust in laboratories and vaults across the British Isles, because they seem to have been made solely because they fit the financial criteria rather than having any potential audience. A lucky few gets a week on a small screen in London before going on DVD, but The Riddle stands out by bypassing cinema, television or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift DVD in Mail on Sunday. <Br /> <br /> It's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away. Apart from a couple of glitches (a boom mike is clearly visible in a shot) it is not very badly made and while Vinnie Jones comes across as the modern British cinema version of Freddie Mills Mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supportive throwing from ham to vaguely passable, no one is distinguished by being either excellent or incredibly bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that like so many sales and leaseback tax funds films, it's a "soft" movie - there's no need to watch it. It exists because the circumstances existed to be made, but it lacks pace or forward momentum. It seems to be targeting Sunday's teatime telly audience (despite being shot in Scope) but not cutting it. There are a few okayish ideas in this particular unofficial tale of an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a few suspicious deaths in today's Limehouse, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as the last-minute supernatural twist (you 'I will never guess who Jacobis literary tramp really is. What have you guessed?) - you almost expect Scooby Gang or Double Deckers to fix it. <br /> <br /> It is a very misunderstood movie for a number of reasons: A few cast members play dual roles when not even playing one, and the whole shock reveals the truth about Dickens manuscript being completely bungled because it all is told in the first person by Dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel. The main killing of the movie is lumpy integrated into the main plot, with signs of suddenly reminding Vinnie that he has already forgotten it, and re-inventing an increasingly desperate half-hour seeing the evil developer Jason Flemgen's secretary puts some rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so she can has his evil way with him and leaves incriminating images behind "to make you see a git with your boyfriend" leading to a dream where he speaks to Charles Dickens ("You are Charles Dickings" What is in a name? ") Which offers it somewhat less than likely suggestions that" You are reading too many books. " But everything that is nothing like the finale, which falls into complete absurdity, with logic and common sense, goes completely out of the window as it plays like a bizarre Jacobean revenge tragedy with handguns on the banks of the Thames, with two-day guest stars Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave looks as though they'd rather be somewhere else (Mel Smith comes up in a one-day cameo, so it is clear that the movie's "names" are mostly there for an easy $ 10k or to meet their alimony payments) . The film's last picture is so completely absurd and meaningless that it is almost worth watching. A curiosity is quite a prominent role in the first third of Vera Day, a kind of prototype Liz Fraser and one-time mainstay of 50s British films - the Bar Drivers of Hell Drivers, the barmaid of Quatermass II - here promoted to pub owner while standup comedian Kenny Lynch shows up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow that - oh the irony - a criminal ... <br /> <br /> Just to round off the package, freebie DVD also included a trailer for the director's second movie with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies , a naff-widespread British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie in the Elmer Fudd duck-hunter outfit terrorized by a revived 2000-year offer sacrifice from the nearest peat bog ("Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting dwuids"). I can hardly wait ... The only thing I can guarantee is, however, that every indie producer in the UK needs the next few weeks to find out how much Mail has paid for the permission to print the DVD ( they paid Prince Â£ 250,000 for their new CD). With so many UK tax-protected Indians on the shelf and with hard-to-find money at the moment, this could be an interesting setback for British flicks.
