I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in fact, the play isn't that bad, and the story isn't as horrible as some made Disney movies have been. The story itself is low and undeveloped, but it is not surprising in a film of this type. The action is more than a little two-dimensional, but I give the actors the honor to do something about the material they were to work with. <br /> <br /> In my book, however, it is inexplicable to base a whole story on the theory that they have created a "perfect" pop star and then cast an actress who cannot sing to save his life . If the girl can't sing, you need a person to record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a FANTASTIC singer - she was so flat that she usually sang in a completely different key!
