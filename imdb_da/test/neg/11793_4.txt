I realize why people hate this movie. And I hated Blair Witch Project, so go figure? It's about there being sometime as it gets and yes, they insult your intelligence by trying to make it a reality. I really liked the Madame Lalaurie story, though it's more than likely done up. But the main reason I like this movie is false or not when the ghosts start attacking and kidnap them, I get chill-bumps every time and have to look behind me as it feels like something is with me. I know this is my imagination, but hey more than half of the drive that is horror in today's cinemas and DVDs does not give me goosebumps, so it makes a horrible joy. Not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it and not for gorehounds as with a PG-13 rating there are none. And the females are very annoying! You will want the ghosts to take them off and experiment with them before it is said and done. ** out of *****.
