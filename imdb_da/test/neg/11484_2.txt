When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The reason involves a young woman living with a widow and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded society, but everything is not as it seems; some kind of twin peaks. The woman begins to see or not see things a people. Under the first wheel I had a hypothesis and thought, "It can't be quite sensible?" Now the end ended or better DOWN, and gave us what I felt was a really weak last act. The sound mix and quality are excellent. Saw it in a THX certified theater and was impressed by the sound and only the sound. The picture lacks fabric.
