I can remember the trailer for this exceptionally weak spin-off of Conan. I watched the film years later and laughed my head away. Unintentional! Bad Briggite Nielson. Her career has never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The film is the movie: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of female warriors who were killed by an evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb, the female warriors protect and use it to destroy every city she passes by. Sonja is hunting for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed his parents. On her quest, she reluctantly included Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go hunting for Queen Gedren and orb. The action is underpairs and the action scenes are soco. I think Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For a person who lost his entire family as well as her female comrades, Sonja doesn't even look up. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! The moronic servant Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the only releasing moments of the movie, although they sometimes fall flat. The scene where they struggle with the mechanical sea creature made me laugh until my ribs were wounded. The dialogue is also a hoot. It's as if the scriptwriter thought nobody should take the film seriously, so he gave all the stupid lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic extra campy movie. Everybody else doesn't bother.
