Unfortunately, House of D is just awful, with a ridiculous plot, horrible writing, some mediocre acts, and actually almost everything else about that sub-par. Tom flies NYC somehow survives as a lonely child in Paris and manages to convince the beautiful Parisian girl that he eventually marries that he is French, despite a poor understanding of her language. She is shocked when he later reveals his "secret" to her! Riiiight! He saw "gifts" his tale of the way to his own son, and who we are expected to believe is just the greatest birthday present a father can give his 13-year-old boy. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny is abusing his own wife Tea Leoni in the role of her mother and once again strikes. Leoni makes me laugh as a cartoon, but she is just plain wrong for this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with this is that none of the characters are sympathetic. I just didn't give anything wrong to any of them. Rather, I hoped that Robin Williams and his trademark "Child in a grown up body" schtick would fall into a Village pothole, but unfortunately it was not, and we had to endure its simpler performance all the way. <Br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin and Wilhelm's daughter Zelda were not bad, but I suppose the rave reviews others give them are simply because they were not as bad as everyone else in this movie. They weren't great, let me say that way. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and controversial aspects to this movie - Erykah Badu, the bike, the Catholic school and its staff of morons, the convenient stupid characters, etc. - that this review would continue forever, so I just want to stop saying that House of D is a very bad movie and I'm almost embarrassed by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is how I was so much encouraged by online "friends" to see this that I traveled far to do it. I would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if I just wasted a few hours at the local cinema, but instead I lost a whole day and discovered that my so-called "friends" are either stupid or dishonest because it's a horrible movie!
