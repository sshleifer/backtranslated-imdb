Bad Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs are trying to disturb the American war effort from within. It is quite difficult to find out at the beginning, because although we know that these guys are up to something, their mode of operation is just not quite clear. I don't want to spoil it, but the end is pretty amazing. There are a number of murders committed by our hero. A police force who doesn't know what's going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like, "A true patriot would do this or that." It is obvious while there is suspicion that most of the world would not know a spy or a subversive if it sprang up and tied them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I have never realized that he has ever done anything other than sitting on a horse. There are, of course, the criminal smugness, as they believe they are immune from the murderer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I don't want to spoil it. As a curiosity and a period it can be fun to look at some people.
