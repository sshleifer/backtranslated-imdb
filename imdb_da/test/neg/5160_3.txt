I should have realized that it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this movie bored me. <br /> <br /> Having seen several indie movies based on the reviews here, and subsequently finding what my opinion is quite the opposite of the other reviewers, I began to wonder if this is possible, I see quite various movies from these people, or are they perhaps friends / family etc from the filmmakers trying to "build their work"? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing an amateur greeting to Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except made with worse actors, a silly score (undermining various scenes) and incredible jumps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please stop trying to "be" Samuel L Jackon a la Pulp Fiction. No one can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please come up with something original. It makes you bad to churn out those things that pretend to be Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Just bad and I really can't see how anyone could say this is a good movie. It's a disgrace that people have somehow managed to score 8.5 on this, the same as films like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. It's not near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it a 3.
