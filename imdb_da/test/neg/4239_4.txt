First, a warning. 'How to Marry a Millionaire' comes prefaced by a seemingly random five minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene', a Gershwin little piece dealt with the full pump and ceremony from Gershwin. Sitting through it takes a little patience. If you have the DVD, you are sure you can jump forward. You won't miss anything. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the eternal disappointments of the 1950s Hollywood, a movie that is enhanced by great power of the stars, lavish mise-one scene and perfect high-concept failure seem unthinkable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, is forced to ask itself - how is it so warm? The script is an albatross about the neck of production, a dead, smelly thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really sparkle in life. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. When an actual comedy scene threatens to evolve, the film quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. A case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear his glasses out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce setup, surely, complete with erroneous identity, angry wife, and a tart in the face for someone? So no. Instead, we cut between the three dates when the ladies respond 'comically' to things their partners say. Hit the punchline and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt, Marilyn goes into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect chart of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's breakout movies, and the camera just eats her up, though the script doesn't give her anything to do. She is so luminescent, she seems almost recently hatched. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been a great star for almost a decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen, even when in the frame of Monroe. She gets the only thing that goes for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She is an inquisitive actress - when she lies about her age in the movie and claims to be forty, it is not immediately ridiculous - and far less girly than her fellow stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from timeless and had a good eight years on her co-stars and put her close to the end of her Hollywood career. There is sometimes a desperation about her, stranded on the screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a couple of comics that can't play their real age, but cheat nobody as a present for this new sharper generation of actresses, trust on the same old schtick who had served her throughout her career (for Marilyn doubters, as the two equals in this movie help to throw Monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence in sharp relief). She is also lumbered with the dead tree compared to male co-stars (though all the men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); She is unable to make any comic sparks out of them. Better to have given his role to the under-utilized Monroe who could be fun himself and left Grable with the repeated Mr. Magoo routine. <br /> <br /> That movie is as fun as it can be put down to the succulent Hollywood production, the kind that makes it possible to see that the two like "at the light of the silver moon" that can be seen. But somewhere, buried under the creepy jokes and professionalism, lies the hard sketch of a sharp, cynical comedy about marriage, which Bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in anticipation of that movie, ready to be disappointed again and again.
