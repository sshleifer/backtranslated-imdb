This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed, and their interactions are exciting, complex and fast throughout this impressive novel. And about 99.8 percent of it was lost in the movie. Seriously, the manuscript and management were terrible and clearly performed by people who could not understand what was good about the novel. I can't fault the actors, for honestly they have never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Crichton's original work. I know good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that meets the original. But this can be the absolute worst inconsistency in the quality between novel and screen customization ever. The book is really really good. The movie is just awful.
