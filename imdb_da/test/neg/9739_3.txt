Most of you out there don't really like this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... can't say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I've seen many stupid, stupid comedies, but this one surpasses every one of them. When I watched, I couldn't stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I saw and trying to determine if I was to laugh or cry, as * there really happened to be things on the screen and people left the theater. <br /> <br /> According to leading figures, the time travel is achieved, just enter a museum and you will actually travel to the past. Plus, if you are looking for death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium to meet Lord - sorry, Loydd and get important commands ... All in all, it doesn't make sense, isn't it? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I see), you might not like it, but you will be fascinated by the author's ability to produce the ultimate STUPID script ... <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from being worse ...
