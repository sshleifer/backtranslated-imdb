1 looked at 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): A silly, youth-focused movie about three children being zapped in their favorite cartoon with their parenting experiment. The manuscript left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara as the rip-off of some Saturday morning 'live action with people in the dinosaur costume kids show' with some cool cavemen hanging around. Nothing really to admire about this and not much to say either. I'm just amazed that I found this in a Blockbuster video store just as bad as it was, and how the stores clean up old VHS movies. I suppose they couldn't even sell it, so back on the rental stand it went.
