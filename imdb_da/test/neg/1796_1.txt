After completing the noisy novel, Heart of Darkness, I moved on to watch the movie, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. At the start, I expected the movie to help with a book's puzzle. But even though I had read the novel, the film still made no sense, so I can't imagine how lost I would be if I had completely skipped the book. It seemed as if the authors picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie and released something that could help viewers understand the meaningless plot. This horrible movie made no sense at all, and I would strongly recommend seeing it, as it will do nothing but leave you completely confused and confused.
