This movie must have done well in the cashier's office to give Gator the budget it deserves. This movie had no budget, needed a script rewrite and a better ending. There is a glimmer of brilliance in this movie. The boat trip stage, Burt runs the average machine and his chat with his parents. You can tell that Burt is a southern and not an actor. This movie shows how Gator would be, Burt's best movie. Too bad, this movie did not have the same funding and was made on Rush. 4.10
