I was thrilled with this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways that this movie is bad. Computer graphics were to say the least. I found the actor stiff and incredible. See the sand as they lost "e-pods" (which original name!) Is available. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other films, ie. Alien, Pitch Black. Now come a big ship to transport a prisoner? And what's with the prisoner? Does he speak, can he speak? I kept waiting for something to tie the pieces of history together, but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I don't think I liked the ending, I didn't. I just liked that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. Don't waste your time on this one.
