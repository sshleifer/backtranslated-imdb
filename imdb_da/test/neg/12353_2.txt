Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches where each one focuses on a female personal entity that became popular in a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the latter half of 1998 instead of the early episodes all directed by Women ). From the opening of statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a wealth of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a worldwide amok with women's reliance on lonely pleasure. Men who Germaine Greer tells more arrogantly have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. The rabbit vibrator (which some statistics suggest accounts for about a quarter of all vibrator shops) is so-called because of small rabbit-like long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris while rotating beads inside the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. The film interviews characters who participate in rabbits anonymously to help overcome their 'addiction' as well as known people like Tom Conti posing as professor or Richard Branson (in the midst of scenes with rabbits being banned on airplanes) who say that He wants to give free rabbits to his first-class air passengers and ultimately to all of them. <br /> <br /> The biggest weakness of the movie is that the idea is not enough to sustain the 85 minute cinema, the sketches do not have the writing skills to say a Charlotte church or Ricky Gervais to make them fun enough, and Though it can make desultor Sennat TVs, they do not have a hook to make people buy up publicly on multiplexers to watch masturbation jokes. <br /> <br /> Lines like "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you?" Slightly thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the pure mention of the word 'rabbit' gets a laugh. . . and another and another. Frantic midnight drive to buy batteries can be entertaining in real life, but here they seem to be very cumbersome and the special emergency service exudes it here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, BBFC gave the 18 certificate despite zero violence, hardly any explicit sex and sexual references that are less "perverted" than any late-night comedy show. The company protested for the decision, but BBFC did not get started. At first glance, this seems overkill on their part, and their consumer advice now simply says, "Includes frequent strong gender references." One might think that young people would find masturbating jokes more fun than the most desperate of night-party hen and the subject of a worthy debate; But cannabis fever does not even have a balanced approach to its subject. The best part is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the movie). For those who have turned off and awakened in the final credits, there is a bonus scene at the end of them to assure them that they have not missed anything.
