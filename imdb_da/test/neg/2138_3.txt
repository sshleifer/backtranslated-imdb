Sometimes it is difficult to judge how badly a movie is made in Italy or Spain really, because they all seem to use the same stable 9-10 ESL trained voters to deliver the English voices for publication in the United States. And things are always lost in translation - yet - the dialogue, character sets and record elements written for the expectations of European audiences must not go too well with our American ideas of what is fun, hip or dramatic. I imagine that the team responsible for the translation of the audio file for this movie into English had about 3 days to make it from start to finish, and they probably each earned an installment payment on their used Fiat to do it. In other words, take pure hackwork, plunged into one or two, and never go through or redone by anyone with a real ear to the American language. <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if you were an Italian looking this in your native language, you might find it a mildly fun little piece of fluff. You will laugh at "the jokes" and the entertaining drunk you will grab the evil villains and villains and you will linger on the attractive couple of Peter and not quite Daryll Hannah as the couples on the beach without apparent reason in the middle of a search for traces of a male eating monster who has already killed one of their friends. But since the crushing voice-to-speech and tin-eared dialogue continue to give us Americans out of the movie experience, we cannot help but notice that the editors had serious disturbance in mind that nobody on the screen can really work as much as drafting an attitude that the reason given for the creation of monsters makes absolutely no sense that the sequences of action have the full effect of a cereal bowl full of boiled oatmeal and that the director, writers and producers really hate women. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about buying or renting this movie - just watch cable TV on Saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist or with the help and protection of Mike and Bots on the MST3K.
