I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. What is wrong with that? Let's start with the free sex, although I admit the rotation form of bonking was something I had not seen (or experienced) before. And I suppose they also save a few money by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are inconsistencies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green part of the city it should be. (Hamilton Ontario ???) But in the scenes on the roof it seems to be in an industrial area with a steel mill that discloses smoke and flames. Also the inside of the building --- the newsroom --- stairs --- seems much bigger than the outside. SPOILERS HERE So when our pristine reporter finally gets fired, she comes back to the building several times, once after hours. Hardly likely. The ending is also miserably predictable ... the classic bait and switchgear, where the good guy turns out to be the bad guy. But my major objection is that this is yet another movie funded by Canadian and Ontario tax credits who are ashamed to settle in Canada and again prove that the Canadian film industry is craving and opportunistic. A country's film should do more than just give jobs. They should reflect the culture. It is bad enough that American studies use Toronto as a stand for New York. But it is embarrassing and annoying when Canadian producers (in this case CanWest Global) do so with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
