Dean Cain, the one-time Super-Man, plays the Max Hooper Super Thief. He can break into any business and steal something at the right price. Unfortunately, his latest withdrawal ends at a height where another has turned off their own attempt to steal the product. Now the thief finds himself having to be the hero who saves everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the second thief is still in the building and F.B.I. & C.I.A. is outside waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost unavailable. Dean Cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material, but here he is sitting with a weak manuscript and a pretty bad direction.
