The movie, mentioned here as made in 1980, is not the movie available from any strange video in their "Driver's Ed Scare Films Vol. 5". First, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b & w for WLWT TV Channel 5 in Cincinnati. Whatever this movie is notorious. However, unlike most other driver's computer films, this was intended for television broadcasting and public viewing. Thus, the level of the carnage has been ratcheted down. It's still a pretty nasty exercise in exploiting bloody death for an alleged educational purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on Channel 5. If you're looking for a movie showing the tone of this unique American movie phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. Whether it really affects any teenager's driving at all, anyone guesses.
