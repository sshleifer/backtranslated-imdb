To say I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur movie made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater two or three times (something I've never done). I was really stopped by Cloris Leachman. She calls true, the only one I have to say. These new women are less fashionable than the George Cukor women of the 30s. These are "acting" for us to try to be with, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. Fun of the original was based on a sharp, vitriolic and very fun script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the elements missing here. TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic about it. It all felt like a put on, improvised at the moment without a clear goal. 2.10
