Brodzki's creation is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. First there was a book written with a good sense of humor. Book that has many fans who would like to help when producers for some reason decided to hire people who hardly heard about the book in the first place. Then a script came as humorless and full of nonsense as possible. At the same time, the manuscript was written in a way that only allowed those who had actually read the books to understand some of the plot. Nothing in this movie, however, made any sense (eg "I'm like an ice card. You can burn yourself," Yennefer said as a warning response - warning that logic is something that this movie is seriously missing). To add to that, we must mention that it does not matter the amount of money allegedly spent on the film, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a sweeping dragon. Even the costumes look as if they were borrowed from a really bad theater. It's the better ones to look this way. And to add to that, we have a couple of 'naked scenes' that are only placed so they will be in the movie because they have no explanation for what one can merely call the plot. The movie has only one strength that can hardly do the rest - music is not bad. Although I should choose, I would prefer to have it separately. It sounds better if you don't have to look at this error in superproduction.
