When one of my friends recommended this to me, I stumbled on how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall greatness of the movie, I naturally expected a fantastic, at least entertaining movie. The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time. I understand that this movie is supposed to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something that anchors it, even if it is at least. This movie felt forced and false. Many shots were unnecessary and so it made me believe that the director was trying to be very artistic. The action was poor, and the relationship between characters was hardly developed enough. Maybe I just miss something that others could see, but I hadn't even realized that there was any kind of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started to think of it as rabbits halfway through the movie. Then again, maybe this movie was just bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not against violence in movies, but in this one almost everything was just unnecessary. Through all the fighting scenes, I felt that it was such a painful clich√© that it was all. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word ridiculous comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't spent two hours in my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the film's flaws, at the end of it, I expected something interesting to conclude with it. I don't want to discuss the end because I don't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just because the metaphor "It's a stone or a grain of sand, in water, they sink like the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made only for shock value and shock value. I just hope that people will later stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I've seen many other great Korean movies and it suppresses me that people have greeted Oldboy as the best.
