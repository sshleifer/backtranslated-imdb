With all sorts of possibilities for a good movie in its beautiful settings, cast and cinematography, the sharp scripts, lead tempo and wood performance of the film produced only a great disappointment. With decent direction, editing and musical scores, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of Blake Edward's '10', instead of a grumpy version of Ron Howard's 'Splash'.
