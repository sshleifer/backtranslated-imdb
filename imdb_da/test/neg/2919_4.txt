While this is not a classic comedy, it is a really good little movie to see if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning with not much else going on right then. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American homecoming after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He has returned from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. Cobb is improperly recruited to run for mayor in his corrupt hometown when the existing political machine that governs the city realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor, who is also the head of the city's underworld. They expect that bumbling, stumbling Cobb has no chance of winning and therefore the current mayor continues to drive the city and run its arrangements that make them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd doesn't do the physical comedy here as he did in his silent movies. He makes a convincing portrayal of Cobb with a reserved undervalued dignity. The action was good from everyone involved, and the story and the manuscript were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> Made in 1934, the movie has a rather racist language when talking about the Chinese, and it also has a typical black character from that era, but these stereotypes are almost as significant as I have seen from other movies from that time. Although it's not close to being Lloyd's best movie, this movie entertains itself, and Lloyd is very good as Cobb. You won't be blown away by this movie, but it may be to blow your interest in Lloyd and get you to to see more of his work.
