The word "boring" is thrown around too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget Horror movie can or may not be. I've seen many a B-movie. Many horrible, terribly inappropriate B movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. Business, miserable action, poor continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unmatched? Some will no doubt be yes. Most of them are probably big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big budget movies so I say no. Bad can sometimes be fun (Blood Freak), sometimes even with thinking (Troll 2), but Drilling will always be unwatchable ... Hi, like bloodthirsty butchers reminding me, I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage ... Uh, yes, anyway. This is one of late British directors Andy Milligy's many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story and still manages to "slaughter" it. Hi, it's pretty funny, I said bu ... sorry, I keep getting distracted. This is not exactly easy. On second thought I will make it easy. No one does, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people who have incoherent conversations. there are bloodthirsty butchers. Oh yes, and something about a barber that kills people and something or something about meat pies. I don't know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something a little more rewarding from Andy Milligan, there is always the only other I have seen, The Rats Coming, The Wolfwaves is here. Yes, you heard me. But how we forget this Milligan guy and get something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, Bloodstirsty Butchers sucks, maybe even more than any other version of this already unclear tale. And that is what B-movie fans really say. 2.10
