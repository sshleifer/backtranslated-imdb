Dennis Hopper must have been really hungry to make this movie. Terrible special effects, very bad writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid killer bio robots. Never mind the obvious disregard of science. The awkward scene with the 2 young people is out of their clothes. The best part of this movie was the pull-start cyber-penis on the wacked-out cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I am in a generous mood.
