I would like to believe that all new horror movies coming out of Japan these days are edgy and make it easier to see. <br /> <br /> Spider Forest is also not. <br /> <br /> It is rare that I have finished seeing something and end up being a waste of time, but Spider Forest was an exception in this regard. I was very teed off. The filmmaker succeeded at one level; Throughout the movie I couldn't stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun of the story. I couldn't stop seeing. So I was so angry when the movie was finished ... they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this POC? WARNING: Spider Forest is another of the Japanese "ghost" stories, even though you are not aware of it. <br /> <br /> I will never see a Japanese ghost story again. They are false and constructed. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big blanket, during which you can sweep all the insoluble plot holes you have in your storytelling.
