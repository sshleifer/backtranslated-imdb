A good idea fell by heavy production. <br /> <br /> Part of the dialogue was incomprehensible because of the level of music / background sound, and it didn't help this reviewer. Welsh accents were also quite impenetrable at times. Towards the end, I lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't know if it was a farce or a black comedy - and they need different approaches. Some of the events were so thick that they only expressed a moan, some were so incredible even for this kind of plot that they made history just not worth following. <br/> <br /> The action was basically good - though the American just came across as a clone of "back to the future" mad scientist. The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I saw it all the way through, but God knows why: I can't remember laughing once.
