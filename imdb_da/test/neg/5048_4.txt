Going In Teaching Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun, fun teenage comedy that would entertain me because it ran out of time. Despite a pretty good first half hour, the film quickly diminishes in a dull clich√© that is as entertaining as pulling your eyelashes out with forceps. Rusty pliers, know. 'Scream' writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie and proved that Scream may have been a fluke. Most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was OK for him to steal items from other films in Scream, because it is meant to be a slasher tribute; here it looks as if he is completely out of ideas. The plot follows the smartest girl in the school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher who caught them in hostages in his own home. However, this is not just a teacher; It's Mrs Tingle, the best bitch in school. She also does not have to be tied to the bed lying either when she starts playing mind games to turn her prisoners against each other. The plot resembles the 1997 girl 'Suicide Kings', and a large number of previous films. In fact, it's not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated the movie with interesting characters; It could have worked really well. Tingle character is the most interesting in the movie, but she is massive one-dimensional and resembles all the other characters in the movie; is just a caricature. The plot is mostly devilish, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is appropriately vicious in the role and while she does not have much to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys playing the central figure herself. Teenage cast is not worth mentioning, with only Katie Holmes standing out; And it's only because of her star profile, not her actors. Williamson has draped almost all the scenes in dreary soft rock music, which would be very annoying if the movie wasn't horrible anyway. In fact, this movie has a few moments that are pretty good; But basically, if you want to see a good example of teenage comedy - this is not the movie you want to see.
