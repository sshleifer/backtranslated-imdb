As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors as well ... aren't really actors, a lot of heavy metal music to compliment rap and of course a crazy chic in leather without hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half the budget. Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by joining such movies? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the prison's first prisoners to be executed have unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> First rate is about, especially any scene with tragedy for the good guys. However, the instructor seriously tried and pulled a modern hard edge for the movie as best he could. Be he gone to the well too often, and half dead will be boring prematurely. What more can you do when the inmates just hang around and talk while the hostages still ask what motivates the biggest bad guy? A mindless action flick that corresponds to a bit, if not "a-ight."
