This movie begins with a man who seems to be a kind of sports driver. He meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an overt idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. The group called Satan's Angels wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no, but then says yes, after the authorities make him a spy to control them. They rob a gun shop in a ridiculous plot-missing scene. The scene involves the woman who enters the store with her long hair in a bowl and large circular glasses on. She says she wants protection and wants the shop owner to put the gun to show her how. She takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. The other three in the band (with the exception of pole) run into the store. They take everything out of the walls and then continue to play with it as children who receive their toys on Christmas day. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly doesn't release a precious screen time with a plot.
