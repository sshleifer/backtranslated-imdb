This movie tried to get something but the failure failed. All the excitement attempts were cheap and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes I ended up laughing and making fun all the way. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> The ghosts are trying to warn the family, so why are they attacking the girl whose name I didn't usually remember. And what was the beginning with the black and white? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell very short. And where the hell did that guy (John Corbett's character) come from? He rolls right from nowhere in a large area. And why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens came? And if ravens were a manifestation of his family's spirit, why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family? Makes no sense. So many things in this movie are just not sensible, and the play is not too beautiful on that part of the maiden character. It's not terrible, just like her kiddy movie days. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie wasn't brilliant, but I was good at ripping it, and sometimes it's all a horror movie has to do. Rental for entertainment, not quality.
