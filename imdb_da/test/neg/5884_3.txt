The title is a mistake: The film depicts almost a year of the so-called "divin marquis". It was a tough time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the calm joys of the Terror regime. Historically, the background is quite outlined: Robespierre's unsuccessful attempt to create a secular religion, his downfall, a sky allowed the opportunity to show Dr. Guillotin's eerie machine at work (full speed). <br /> <br /> As far as Sade is concerned, it is a fair mediocre affair: he waits in a previous nunnery with other noble, a golden cage, if you compare it to saying Marie-Antoinette or the fate of researcher Lavoisier and he changes futile conversations with a young virgin about death, love, and other trivia. There is the mandatory "bold" scene, but you'll have to be patient because it's a long time before it comes on the screen. And yet, with today's standards, can we call it risqu√©? Cy Enfield's "De Sade", which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of IMDb, is at least entertaining, and Keir Dullea was a more credible marker than the aging Auteuil. And it was John Huston.
