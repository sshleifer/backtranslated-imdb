Absolutely brain-dead action in the Philippines. This belongs to the Filipino film, which attempted to pass as American films on the international market. After a rather dull start, the film takes out and never disappoints. It's actually a rip-off of the worst movies Chuck Norris has ever made: An American prison in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets, who implant a microchip into his brain, so he's programmed to kill the pope, then the US president. One of his old friends (played by B-movie stalwart Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Totally ridiculous action scenes, sinister action (Nick Nicholson's performance as the evil Soviet commander is a must-see!) And unimaginable plot is one of the cheesiest action images ever donated to the public.
