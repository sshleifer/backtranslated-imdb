"Gross Abuse" was one of a number of texts published in Australia in the early mid-1990s, exploring the suspected victimization of the privileged heterosexual man of feminism. This creature only needs to look at a beautiful young thing and he is accused of sexual harassment and his life is destroyed. Damn the women's libers! Grrr ... As my tone might suggest, I do not buy any of this anti-feminist BS and do not belong to this movie. 'GM' trivializes the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. Sexual harassment is here a product of a confused young woman's imagination, and the professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain ... Well, when the teacher is a charming and beautiful family member (and played by Jimmy Smits!), You need the? Don't worry about them. <br /> <br /> Sexist trash can, and even by reviewing it, I give it more time than it deserves.
