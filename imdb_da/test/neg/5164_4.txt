I saw this movie today on the big screen and I honestly can't believe in any of the comments made by people here. I really hoped to be touched by this movie, but I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I am a former Australian army and very patriotic to this great country, but I feel this movie by no means does justice to us and the soldiers fighting in this battle. The film is poorly filmed. I thought the play was terrible, they weren't credible, and they gave me no reason to worry about them. People say this movie was graphic, there were a few graphical scenes, but I found it mostly very weak. The war scenes were very short and lasted only a few minutes. A general weak film that does not make these soldiers fair.
