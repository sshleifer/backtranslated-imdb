This show is like watching someone in training to host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre. It does not seem that the authors know the difference between what is fun and what is just weird or rough. <br /> <br /> It has its moments. When Spike knocked down a neighbor who had let his dog feed his grass several times, it hit its peak. But those swollen moments are too few and there are too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark. <br /> <br /> The view is better than saying a test pattern or QVC network, but it needs some better authors. <br /> <br /> Reading the glowing positive IMDb comments on this show, I am convinced that most of them are written by show staff and by relatives and personal friends of Spike. <br /> <br /> It's just not very good most of the time.
