Christophe Lambert once said that he still made movies just to make good and easy money. When I see his latest releases, I can believe it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Beowulf is in the "good" part of the crap films. In fact, there are some good excitement scenes. The actors themselves are not that bad. But the plot is stupid, the "Mortal Kombat" -like music has nothing to do here; was. I wish I wasted my money on something else. <br /> <br />
