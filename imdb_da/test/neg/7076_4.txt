I work on a video store so I got to see this for free god, if I had paid for it, my review would be less forgiving. <br /> <br /> Well, the big idea of ​​the movie (geeky girl taking bloody revenge) is not so original, there are more parallels to "carrie" (playing an average practical joke on a loser, except a nice girl that is actually upset by her, tamaras and carries poor family background). I still think it is a fun idea for blurry teen horror flick unfortunately they have not taken much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather emphasize all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked the actress who played tamara she looked good (when she was hot) and her catty lines were funny ("Sean can't come to the phone. He's f ** king patrick! "). <br /> <br /> What didn't work: the whole wicca thing was stupid. I generally prefer rational explanations (she could have plotted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were many logical wholes, and gore looked really bad (when the boy cuts off his ear and his tongue - thanks !!!) <br /> <br /> the whole idea was not tied to Oscar buzz, but I just think that they wasted the comic and the exciting potential they had. it was tolerable but far from good!
