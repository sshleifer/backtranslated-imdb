I'm a fan of the old SCTV show of the late 70's and early 80's, and John Candy was a big reason why. He got a lot of fun out of the sign on the wall and was simply fun. Unfortunately, he couldn't get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed with the mediocre movies, where he almost played the "straight" role instead of the funny guy. "Armed and dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter. It is simply a very predictable police and robber type movie. If you are John Candy or Harold Ramis fan, the movie can be seen, just don't expect to laugh a lot.
