This movie was clean, slow, plodding torture. Don't be a fan of slasher movies and prefer classic horror, I might not be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. I really want the 90 minutes I used to see this back. The only reasons to see this is 1) a young Vanna White (Fort Wheel of Fortune) that has approx. 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) An early role by screaming Queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and legendary beauty EJ Peaker as a school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, an 80's band called Felony is a look that is interesting at the same time, pulling on for a long time. Like the movie ..... I had to keep an eye on how much time was left and couldn't wait for "Graduate" for a better movie.
