First, I have to say that I have seen the '39 version at least 100 times; knows all the dialogues and has read the '36 game, which is different from '39 and contains nuggets of gold alone. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There is a reason why you haven't seen an expensive TV ad campaign for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the original catty tone and how the women used to wage each other. GUESS WHAT??! It was Booth's intention. It was a slick, theatrical record gossip, infidelity and smoking among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites. The audience who made this new version did not intend to honor the original source material. They choose it strangely and put a half scene here and a half scene coming from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in a few scenes and acting on the old Countess in a broad, laughing style) has no context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck", which is a key element of the original - then he is never mentioned again. This movie is so boring that I won't over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I found incredible:> Mary Haines jumps to her domestic staff: "I can suck my nails out of a table!" Right. Good writing. Norma Shearer could have made a line reading on it and got an Oscar nom, right? > A COMPASSIONAL Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted and the movie was just as goodbye. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic book that swept through the game. As portrayed countless by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, patient woman who rode off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialogue that is still classic and quotable. She was not over to bite Paulette Godard's ankle. The filmmakers from 2008 decided that this character had to die. When she killed her, they killed the movie.
