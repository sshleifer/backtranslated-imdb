This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't go in with high expectations, but as soon as it started I thought it could be o-k. It wasn't. Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a diabolical cartoon character. The other players all seem to try their best, but are kind of wood. The foundation has a good foundation, but the melodramatic lines make it boring and kind of stupid. I laughed the other half of the movie, and after five minutes I got tired of it. Most plot 'twists' you could see from several miles away. It's just not worth seeing. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.
