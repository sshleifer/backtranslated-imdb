Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist, and smug movie that effortlessly uses the Middle East conflict as a backdrop for an action flip designed for a comfortably protected American mid-west audience. The conflict, as well as those involved, is simply used as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the benefit of 'freedom'. But what's worse is that the movie's action scenes are dormant and unexciting, which prevents Navy Seals from acting as a mindless shoot-up. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen's character (Hawkins) is disgusting, unpleasant, ignorant, ruthless and above all racist. He refers to the Middle East as a 's ** t-hole' and to its inhabitants as 'rag-heads'. Throughout the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are honored through the use of the Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They massacre these people with a consequence-free attitude. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his language before he shoots him while making another humorous quip. Besides being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The movie's extreme (but predictable) pro-American attitude is also disgusting. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American female journalist informs Hawkins that terrorists cannot be made to speak because "they are religious zeal." Hawkins is retarding 'yes, and we're Navy Seals!' Of course, the implication is that jealousy is meaningless alongside American military power. In addition, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating her as a sex object, the script requires its inability to resist this obnoxious gang, and she even ends up sleeping with him - because he's an American navy seal. This marginalizes the journalist's character by making her submissive to Hawkins 'superior' pro-American attitude despite his abusive behavior towards her. In addition to ethics, this plot also has some credibility as a drama. <br /> <br /> The play is also amateurish. Most scenes are simply tense together without thinking of mood, plot or character development. The "music video" scene on the golf course, for example, is just shoddily edited eyeshadow. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the ruthless hero are also pointless. In one, he jumps from a bridge from moving the car just to show his buddies how hard he is, and in the other he throws a pulled truck on a push bike and drives his car off it. Neither scene has a follow-up anti-climax, both are very unlikely and have no bearing on the plot as a whole. They are just candy designed as a means to showcase Hawkins' cheap all-American heroics, and are bad substitutes for character development. Most of the other plot development scenes are also poorly filmed and poorly scripted - actually affecting this disorder throughout the movie. Apart from the African American Navy Seal and his wife as well as the characters Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, every other member of the team appears unknown to the audience, so when the climatic scenes roll around, no one seems to be rooting and anyone is dead to complain. <br /> <br /> In such a film, action sequences can potentially save production. But here they don't. These are poorly directed, poorly lit, and exhibit poorly executed stunts. In fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting in the scenes not being incomprehensibly difficult to follow, but also in a complete lack of fear and excitement. Poor lighting only adds to their impotence. The explosions look fake, firearms not convincing, and one of the more daring stunts involving colliding a Mercedes over a tank resembles a stunt that has been staged on a backlot and then poorly edited. <br /> <br /> Completing the Navy Seals places the coins in the eyes of this production. First, there is the mandatory slow-motion 'run-away-from-the-big-explosion-it-must-have-kill-me' scene with Sheen carrying Biehn on her back. It was clear that the standard scene was supposed to be the star of the movie trailers. Then there is the end when the rest of the Sealhold, wounded and floating in the sea, is rescued by a submarine. This submarine had actually been home long before, but of course it had miraculously returned in time. In spite of the violent and stressful ordeal of the seals, despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, with some of them still bleeding acute, they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing America tremendously. Predictable? You can only imagine this ending as you watch the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film uses the Middle East conflict at all as a means of macho-all-American tendencies in the film's photogenic young leaders. Arabs are discouraged and dismissive, and their slaughter in the film is used as a means of glorifying the use of US military power against a "inferior" minority group in an impact-free environment. The events of 2001 have pointed out that such an alley and convincing trivialization of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free pass time. The Middle East can no longer be written off as a s-t hole full of rag heads knocking each other (to quote Charlie Sheen here); It is now a place where involvement can lead to serious consequences. Today, we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home. At least, Navy Seals looks pretty silly these days; but it must be good. This is a very ignorant film whose production values ​​and professionalism are just as suspicious. Navy Seals is ideologically and artistically a complete insult to its audience's intelligence.
