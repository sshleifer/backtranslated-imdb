Poor second-string feature from Universal Pictures about a mother's boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military, averting the progress of the brash young woman he has been awarded for romance. Robert Montgomery directed and starred in this adaptation of the short story "Come Be My Love", and his acting notions in this era are incredibly lazy. The reason is sappy, predictable stuff, and the author Robert Carson has given all the really fun lines (as usual for movies during this period) to the feisty black maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support but they can't do much with this hokey material. * from ****
