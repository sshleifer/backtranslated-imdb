Who the heck had the "bright" (?) Idea of ​​casting Lucille Ball into this movie ??? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby all the way. At least Lucy should have got her sung baptized. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman's score is pretty well kept intact except "It's so young I feel" and we get performances by the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /> <br /> I suppose Robert Preston had to be given a song, therefore the inferior "Loving You". <br /> <br /> All in all, I believe in one that the wrong redheads were thrown.
