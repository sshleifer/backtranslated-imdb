Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? The star Mel Gibson, who also directed and was written by Randall Wallace. The movie contains over 200 errors. Does anyone remember the green accounts? It's John Wayne Western, where the duke rescues a farm called Vietnam from a bunch of orders from the commie tribe. If you see we were SOLDERS, you can't help but remember these two movies. First of all, what about the Scottish complaint that has been played three times in the film, four if you count the final credits? I mean, what is the connection between Scotland and `Nam? Maybe Wallace uses the in vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - unreservedly I can add - with more Oscars, so can this movie? Whatever the reason it included the real jars. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne, and I expected him to say something like "They will never take our freedom - hell they will" and it is impossible not to see other similarities with the green buckets as the subplot. by a journalist recording a gun and becoming a warrior, and Moore tells the journalist blame for a scene that is almost identical to that seen in the Wayne movie. <br /> <br /> Not to mention other films WWS also fail to stand on its own, it is based on real events in 1965, but seems to lack an integrity needed to make history fair, never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place, probably because it was filmed in america not asia. Hal Moore could have refurbished the French experience in Indo-China, but if so, he was unique because the US military went out of their way not to read about the French Indo-China War when asked about The former conflict Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "Who has not won a war since Napoleon's days" so I was confused by NVA's depiction in this film when the American High Command in 1965, filled with hubris the North Vet and VC in contempt. It's like history has been rewritten to show the rice farmers in Vietnam are superlative warriors. They are, but very few Americans believed this in the mid-1960s <br /> <br /> There are a few other things that confused me as how the wives come home, get telegrams telling them theirs husbands are dead? No bodies are shown flying back to the base, and no one on the screen is referred to who has been killed in the La Drang Valley. Likewise, we do not see reinforcements on the screen, so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number NVA? I am putting them down as Wallace's director / editorial blunders, who don't hit me as much by a director, and his biggest problem seems to communicate the horror of the fight. Take the scene where the American burned to a sharp, flew away and screams: "Tell my wife, I love her". This should have an emotional effect similar to the scene of this death in PLATOON, but here there is no impact. In fact, I found the scene cliched and condescending, and he is not the only character to mouth the words "Tell my wife ..." while mutilated or dying, I figured at least two other characters use the sentence. Did characters actually say this in the fight? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I have reservations <br /> <br /> I sat in shocked awe that saw APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE MURING FIELDS made my eyes water, I laughed at the FULL METAL JACKET, I continued to look at my watch with DEER HUNTER, and after watching WE BE AWARE, I felt completely patronized
