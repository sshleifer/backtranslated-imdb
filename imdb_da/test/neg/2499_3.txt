D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrid does not really live up to its extraordinary title and exciting performance, where various rapid modern types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear trials, but mostly the movie is so slow, the action So gloomy and thrown so clearly repelled to have to have sex with each other that the movie becomes a task to watch. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, because the movie sets a promising idea. A group of scientists are taken to the Atoll by a naval man in a small vessel. The researchers ?? three women and two men ?? is an exciting cross-section of sexual types that suffer from varying degrees from nymphomania, co-dependence and liberty; There is even an exciting foray in the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops at a brothel to be served by two hunky Caribbean studs for hire. The creature itself ?? one lacked native islands with a terribly scarred face and an unfeasably long pizzle ?? Carries some affinities with the old being from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has hovered over the post-modern man since the Cold War began, despite the fact that those of us in the West have returned to hedonism and relativistic science. <br /> Porn Holocaust is definitely a movie showing the post-sexual revolution that Westerners come across their mirror image in a nuclear monster, but the torpidity it unfolds really lets in the mind's mind. There is a promising interplay of action shots with POV shots, suggesting that the monster (who looks / stalks as horror monsters from their POV position tend to do) is akin to voyeur in the audience getting rid of the flesh between "beautiful people" . " The sight of the monster forcing a beautiful young woman to suck her over-painted member surely throws the ugly fantasies of the target man in their face. But D'Amato has developed similar ideas better in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially hard idea that has been knocked down during the performance (although D'Amato's usual film skills release him with very boring camera work).
