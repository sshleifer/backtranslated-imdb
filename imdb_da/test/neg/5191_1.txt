Ewe, the opening scares zero budget. The titles that resemble my grandson are loosely detached with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be treated in the old 80-year-old movie movie. NIX! Hardly any nudity from a flick that stars Traci Lords! This movie really also needed nudity. Instead, you get many men's perkies pointing through a shirt, but they seem to be activated by hot steam. It's strange, in my world, the headlights are in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The reason is pathetic, the blind guy is just a joke and not a joke. His antics are so compulsory and predictable. He travels over things and you see him bracing in the fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that looks like it was shot months later and deployed to get a distributor. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's just a matter of time before Starbucks comes across it. Not even fun. When Billy arrives in the city for the first time, they come across Namoi Bucks, he says: "Wow, they have these everywhere." This leads you to believe that it is a parody of Starbucks, but the surprise behind the counter of this location is Namoi himself. Apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this big chain decided to work in a small cold town. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie is about is Warren Miller snowboarding. Yes it's all Warrens stuff, so if you want to see a good action, take a Warren miller flick. Leave Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. There is no need to rent it or buy it and if a friend offers you a copy for free. Hit him and finish the friendship.
