For me, this movie is just a very very boring teenage movie with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotypical characters (Nerd, Jocks, Popular Girls, Sleezy guys, etc.), but with an underlying anti-drug / drink theme. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this movie, keep an eye on all references to responsibility and keep it right (dunno how else to say) I think the only thing that would do this movie cool, would be if the tv playing it was on fire. That, or the DVD it was exploding ... <br /> <br /> 1 in 10000 - See Animal House instead.
