There are only 2 reasons to see this show ... I already invested the time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you should have Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels of the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from day to day and you'll see what hack these BSG authors are. Their only gimmick is "who is the fifth cylinder". Bad writing and really, really no sense of character development. If Adama resigns or tries to take power or cry again or discover the inner father, he should have been once again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is so annoying a character ever set aboard a constellation. Out airlock with her. I could fit less if it is six months before they conclude. These wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one. If you don't know, you just don't know how to write.
