I heard what people were saying, but I ignored them. Being hasty on Blockbuster I grabbed a copy of this movie and ran out. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes in, I struggled to stay awake. There is some attempt to keep the film interesting, but it was just bad. A kind of hunting takes place, but it was long and pulled out - the perfect time to make a snack. When this movie was over, I didn't care how ended, I just wanted to end it. Go in and out of my room to see if it was over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a clich√©, the characters and their relationships. The reason is predictable, as well as the end. The actors made the most of really terrible roles. All to say is: their clothes were nice, but the movie, it was just bad.
