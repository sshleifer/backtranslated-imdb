I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I see here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surprised. Although yes. I'm very impressed with Robin and Matt's plays, they still don't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I have mathematics at my disposal. Maybe I'm not too much to dare to talk for 2 hours. Although I loved "American Beauty", but it was. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I miss something in this movie, please send me an email. I'm curious why this is at the top 250. And don't say "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
