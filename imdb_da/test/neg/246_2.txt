2/3 of this film is the re-film of the previous films, a fact that unfortunately is obvious even to anyone like myself who has not seen the original films. And somehow it feels like a rip-off, even though I haven't seen things before. It's like the episode of each television show, where the characters are sitting around a photo album or something, and you can just watch reusable movies of other episodes. I've seen some manufacturers do extended assembly of recycled material, but never anything more than 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly things that had already been seen by the audience so you could mount a case that is one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the public movie. <br /> <br /> I got to see it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough, I suppose to consider how rarely this kind of material should be on film these days. I give the film some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but it's about it. Aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some movement in his face, which is better than most movie monsters of the period. But the robot is pitiful, although it is interesting that they made the human face completely visible. It is a "robot man" or something of the kind they explain something in the movie. I think it is considered an android. So technically in hard sci-fi terms, this movie should be called "Android vs. Aztec Mummy", but I doubt anyone was too concerned about technical features more than they were concerned about quality. In fact, the movie is so creepy that it makes the television good. Even the headline from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, at some point the hero says: "I might as well begin in the beginning ...." What is the bad form of translation? Couldn't they at least make him say "start in the beginning" so it doesn't sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have attached the manuscript of this movie. It is the epitome of utilitarian film making, just absolutely nothing in this movie that does not have to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. They didn't do more than they had to do, and in view of the extensive recycling material, I would doubt they actually spent more than a week making this movie. <br /> <br /> I will now cease to write about it on the principle that I do not want to spend more energy commenting than the film's creators actually exploited while doing so.
