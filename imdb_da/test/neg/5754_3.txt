Hercules ended up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a really good classic, just to become a sad joke. I really like Kevin Sorbo and his supportive cast, but I did not care about the direction the show took since their movie equivalents either. I think the show would have had a much more successful run if they had kept the same format they did for the movies. <br /> <br /> I saw at the beginning and lost interest along the way. I experienced the odd episode afterwards, but my attention overwhelmed it was fortunate to make it a commercial break.
