Worst movie ever !! It is not wise or fun or thought-provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors did their best with a terrible script. It was so bad you could see the dead people breathing. Maybe the author / director combination they were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know about making a movie about something that is still cool), but otherwise failed. <br /> <br /> I hope the author never makes another movie ever !! Not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom companion or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, although it is silent with stereo, it is still a painful 84 minutes.
