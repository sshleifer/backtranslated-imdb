I see absolutely nothing fun --- even extremely fun --- in this silly movie. An unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea - just ridiculous. It is hard to believe that the protagonist, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted to any college. Even more difficult to believe is that nobody shuts down the place. The actors portrayed characters straight out of Characterville. We have seen their mass many times in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on sennat tv, and since there was nothing else on it, I saw the whole dull, stupid movie. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you might find it fun. Movies are made for an immature mind, so teenagers go after it. The rest, no way.
