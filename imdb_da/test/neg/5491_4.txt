It is partly unfortunate for "Illuminata" that it comes out after "Shakespeare in Love", as it deals with virtually the same themes in life as art, art as life and the magic of the theater and the same archetypal folk theater people, but there are scenes that come to life as a game develops and is interpreted by a writer's life, but there is a lot of Orson Welles-ish ego in this produced by / directed John Torturro as a vehicle to his wife Katharine Borowitz (with a sweet cameo of their son). <br/> <br /> Every actor instantly gets their spotlight on the spotlight, but there are so many "masques" or set pieces that resemble 19th century parlor games. Bill Irwin Talks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes another kind of villain - a gay critic. The women must unrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film. <br /> <br /> Art and direction are wonderful, but quite dark. This should get a prize as the best use of a Jersey City Theater as a set ever in a movie. (originally written 8/21/99)
