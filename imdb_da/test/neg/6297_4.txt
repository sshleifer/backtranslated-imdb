Basically a road movie. Homosexual, transgender and other gender-related issues are rather disturbing, especially when the child is involved. You have to hand it over to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I knew was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, out of his (or any) normal range. The movie as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the clever, bitchy banter. All in all, I do not recommend this one.
