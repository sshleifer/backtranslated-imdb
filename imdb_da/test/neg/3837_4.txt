Hopper has never been worse than he felt, as this movie is only worthy of a Class B performance, and he delivers a pretty good one. Outside Madsen and Hopper, the play is terrible; You've seen better at your local high school. The sound and sometimes editing and camera shots are low end of B film. The scene with peeping tom is of the movie's greatest free nudity scenes I've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to fit in the movie). The script was probably a fantastic 10-sided outline, but when it comes to a full-length movie, there are several gaps in it when the dead bodies left Madsen. I must say that Hopper dressed in a nice suit that ran Hummer made me laugh loudly, but I don't think it was the intention. Yes, there is a small style, and Hopper can always draw my interest. But the interesting plot concept never pays, and you are excused why you wasted your time watching this.
