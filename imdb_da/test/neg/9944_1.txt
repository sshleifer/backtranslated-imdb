This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It must be a remake or update of "The One-armed Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. Ham-fisted direction and crappy battle choreography means that battle scenes aren't even worth seeing. The script desperately tries hard to think seriously, but is full of clich√©s like, "And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again ..." or "If only I had known what a heavy price I should pay." Ugh! And who is the girl playing song? Someone finds her and has eliminated her !! She's horrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you'd be better off with Lau Gar Leung. This stinks.
