Wow, where do I start? Having suffered through this miserable $ 1.00 rental (thanks a LOT, Family Video) I just had to make a few comments. I did not disturb to write down the names of the 3 actors in the movie, but hopefully you will know who I am talking about. <br /> <br /> A monster car is terrorizing the country and chasing two college-aged friends for their destruction. They encounter a hot girl wearing plain clothes. I mean, that sounds just amazing in theory. I laughed hysterically on the DVD box while I went to the girl behind the counter in the video store. <br /> <br /> Acting: The hot girl played by Aimee Whatever, shines visibly through many scenes where she should be scared. The other two big players in the movie, the cool prankster and the vanilla straight guy are both terrible. The cool guy thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, over-emotes and misses all his signals and comes across as a generic character you might see in a made-for-Nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90s. See: I do not expect great performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort not to be annoying. You can be an incompetent actor, but still be comfortable (that is, John Wayne). At least, Aimee is crazy attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy **** Who Thought This Dialogue Was Fun? I wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my class school drama class, much less pitch it like a movie script. Incredibly bad. More on this later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the movie absolutely succeeds. Production quality is incredibly high. The look of the film is very good. Apparently, the only talented person working on the movie was Director of Photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here are my biggest gripes: 1) The driving car never runs faster than 25 miles per hour. <Br /> <br /> 2) The guy driving the car is well out in the country before he realizes that there is a fat man in a mask in the back seat. He seems to be careful about registering gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition, but does he not notice a 300 lb Jackpot impersonator on the back? Come again. <br /> <br /> 4) Signs never change their clothes. There are two hotel scenes. It is likely that there are showers available for our characters even during the 3 days this movie takes place, none of the characters are bothering to change their clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Light heart, slapstick comedy does not interfere with horror. Period. You can't have our characters run away from a monster truck for a second, and the next second they have verbally blasted each other with some dopey light / comedy music games. This kind of pacing almost destroys any tension in the movie. Movies like Evil Dead 2, which mixes comedy and horror, understand that tensions can be loosened, but never completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man doesn't get it. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that what could have been a very funny horror movie was destroyed by a director who thought he was much more clever than he really was. Oh good.
