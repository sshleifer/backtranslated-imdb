The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not that bad. The action is, however, poor. The lighting is poor. The music is bad. The scenes of the torturers are without feeling. There really isn't much to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you are for when credits say "Special Guest Star" and list someone you have never heard of. Could just as well say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there really is no one in this movie you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end, and I think the floor plan might have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inappropriate rodent.
