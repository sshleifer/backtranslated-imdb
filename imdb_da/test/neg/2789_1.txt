According to the budget information provided on this site, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where the money was spent, I'm not quite sure. Let me see .... costumes ... no ... location and set ... hmmm, don't think .... especially f / x ... NOT ... plays ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic tale of a young man who inherits a family farm in the mountains of West Virginia. His girlfriend speaks to him about taking their friends up there to check out the place. Once here, our monstrous hero teaches that his grandfather used a unique method to make his crops grow, and now it is revenge time. Killer Scarecrows for revenge !!! Ewesig scary. Well no, not really. We all know that there have been some great movies made with very little money, but it's not one of them. This movie contains basically some of the worst plays and dialogue I have ever seen. Terrible cliches with horrible delivery. All in all, don't be fooled by the half decent coverage and avoid at all costs. I would like to give the filmmakers at least one D to try, but I'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with it. GRADE: F
