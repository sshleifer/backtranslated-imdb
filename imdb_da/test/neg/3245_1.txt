If you've seen this movie then you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying Hollywood movies. Who would know they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between both movie industries is Hollywood spending millions and Bollywood spending 100 thousands (average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2 style movie, do it right. The director added a fake fantasy story about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but blamed for 10 people. She suddenly rebuilds for a ghost and together they will kill the 10 people they owe for her death. Not to mention, the reincarnated snake guy or villain has any kind of superpowers. He can turn into something he can fly, disappear, firepower, wind power, it's called he has it. He even gets bazookered and survives the T1000 style. You probably wonder how he survives. It is best not to ask and it is best not to waste time and money on this movie. Its best to just forget about this movie itself. I think it's a shame to use a big star jump for this monstrous movie with a nonsense story.
