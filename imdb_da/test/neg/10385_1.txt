When the metaphorical flies escaped from this steaming aqueous stool in a movie, I found myself wanting to join them. <br /> <br /> From the open sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talented. The script editor was probably dead and the director was supposed to be. To be honest, I did not manage to finish this movie because about twenty bad minutes in the main actor's eyes sliding across the floor like a Shetland pony shot in line was too much for me to stomach. <Br /> <br /> I have never, and I mean, never seen a movie as sweaty as this, and I see lots of crap movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
