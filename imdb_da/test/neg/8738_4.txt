MASTER PLAN: Has the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the taste of the famous "Enter the Dragon" from '73, this is an attempt from South Africa. The fortresses of the villains are slightly different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a Baron or General, is a slightly more perverted version of the "Dr. No" or the Han Sham of the masterpiece that has strange flashbacks for the Nazi German glory days. He carries the full regalia of Nazi uniform on some points. His greatest ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of their involvement in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds stupid, and that is, even though the suggestion of madness and crazy machismo works almost. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles a white "Bruce Lee" character who has a similar lean, lethe physics, but of course not at the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought he would be a secret government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend have joined Baron's team of warriors, but decide to quit (what did they think they came in?). Of course, it's not that easy. There is an unequal order of those flying through the desert using a broken car with a rigged sail - these desert wives can make wonders for journeys it seems. <br /> <br /> The plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half, which the hero joins the rogue's competitor, and the boyfriend held in hostages by the villain in a cell threatened by rape of the heroes rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; he is loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the hero. Much of the fighting utilizes the heroes' ballet-like qualities, with much leap and slow motion. The sound FX is also amplified and exaggerated in an attempt to add more power to the beats. There are a few good games during the tournament against climax, but no one stands out. If one were to choose, I assume that the best involves the baron's brutal muscular man, introduced late in the story (he lifts back on a car at some point). You wonder how the hero will take him out at the end, as the break seems to be moving at most strokes. The actor is very mediocre, down in the camp as far as the girlfriend, who tends to laugh without reason, as if she is tall on grass, even though she is very sweet. Some of the training scenes are also campy, especially all the guys who run over or roll into the desert sand. And with such a title, there are surprisingly few actual killings. Ryan, like Steve Chase, came back as a traditional agent in the sequel "Kill and Kill Again."
