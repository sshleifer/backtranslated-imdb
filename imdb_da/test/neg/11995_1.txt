A total and complete travesty of a movie. 'Dark power'is that kind of movie, even the troma would be embarrassed to escape. The script, the direction, the action, and the sequence of actions are so bleak that they are almost painful to see and one cannot think that only 75 minutes of running time could have been better spent. The aforementioned reviewer must be related to the director as this is the only reason I can see for his / her assessment of this nonsense, some may call it b-movie fun or "so bad, it's good" just to apologize for that enjoyment Of that, but when leading actor (and most experienced cast member) cannot deliver his lines convincingly, you know you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
