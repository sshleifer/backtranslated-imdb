(There are Spoilers) The usual slasher movie with the story takes place in and around this godly mine outside the almost deserted town of Sutterille. After receiving a postcard and gold pin from his brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, run to the village along with four other friends and armor gold prospectors Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell & Sangie, and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina for inserting their claims. <br /> <br /> It later turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the infamous Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, to come back to life and restart its terrorist government. Stone, or 49er, is about the most ridiculous slasher / murderer in film history. Stone looks as if he was buried for years under a few tons of coal running around with this hook slipping people in half. Having done in almost all the caste local hermit Tunt Nelly, (Karen Black) whose daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stein's victims, they still tell alive that unless they return the gold to the stone mine, The crazy miner never rest until he kills all those who still have it. Aunt Nelly just gets enough time to tell her story before she has become a human torch of Stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream. The film continues indefinitely with the killer miner on the ramp saw, which looks as though he is as scary as the burnt toast and just as dark. Even those in the movie seemed to show no real fear for him. In a scene, when he broke into Aunt Nelly's house, everyone within everyone, instead of running away, filmed him who caused the ghost memory to lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's pick picked up for his "stump". <br /> <br /> In addition to the actor Karen Black, the movie "Miners Massacre" also features veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as the city's Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Passable things, but nothing in particular the film has a predictable ending with the whole gold mine that goes up in flames. The audience gave a hint of the decision makers of "Miners Massacre" that the end of this thoughtless lunacy is nothing in sight and can very well re-emerge in the near future in any successor, God helps us all!
