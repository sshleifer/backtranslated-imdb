Tyra Banks must teach these girls that it is not about being beautiful on the outside. Inside, something also counts. Many of the previous winners have seen semi decent but are terribly cruel and start troubling the other girls. I see Tyra less involved in the girls in each season. About the only thing worth seeing Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a participant who was a pre-trans transsexual. I felt she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had uncertainty about her original anatomy, which showed through her feminine appearance. Tyra should have given her tips or maybe she could have sent resident Trannie Ms Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the competitor was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD, and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of renewal of a little more humanity.
