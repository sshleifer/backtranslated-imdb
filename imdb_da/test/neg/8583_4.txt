For a horror movie, this is criminally boring. A few memorable, cruel bits can't compensate for a really bad script. Very little coherence is achieved and the film at all gives its one basic idea (a killer cat) until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by constant use of shoots from the cat's point of view.
