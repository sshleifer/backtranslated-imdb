I made a big mistake to watch this movie. It's the lottery to watch movies I guess. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I struggled hard to stay in my seat - the old "lose two hours in your life" kind of feeling. The basic problem It is without mentioning the entire "historical accuracy" thread of reviews, the manuscript is painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have been spread out for an hour to provide a plausible, real plot development. Instead, it was pushed from a uranium "dramatic" event to the next. Having the girl cry at the start of the movie makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this time. And it all went into the sunset through the long grass field at the end, what the hell was that about? <br /> <br /> Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You could almost feel his pain on some of the lines he had to pronounce. The most marvelous horrible thing was without apparent reason that he was staring at the girl as she copied her work in her apartment, she looked up, it all went a little fuzzy romantic kind - a lighting (or I dream), and he says with authority in his voice, <br /> <br /> "wash me" <br /> <br /> And she gets up and washes him with a sponge. "Wash me" WTF? It is fun. <br /> <br /> Then there was the music. The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony poured out of the surround sound in the cinema, and the choir waited and waited and stood there quietly for what seems like forever. And then, finally, launches in tremendous sound. It was spine-chillingly wonderful and I dare say it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> So it was here that the movie picked up two stars. The only part of the movie where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed in him.
