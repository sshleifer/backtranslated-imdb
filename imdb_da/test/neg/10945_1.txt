Now I like the Bollywood movies and I am very pleased that they have recently been successful in the UK. Suneel Darshan's latest effort, however, is a deeply defective film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood recording on Amadeus was quite exciting, that is, until the two were "musicians" appearing on stage, they seem to have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very nice man and the film plays to his narcissistic feelings, but he is never even credible as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting, all he can do is stand there and pout. His expression, hair and clothes all look alike, including the scene where he presumably "dies" when he actually seems to have nothing but a little sniffle. Bobby Deol, who plays the role of Salieri, does his best to experience the little wood script that is there, but unfortunately it just comes up as a bit angry when he has to joke with jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are known for their amazing set pieces and color schemes, but Shaklaka resembles a killing BBC drama reproduction. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka is going to be is Hollyoaks, as it secretly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people who look good. "He has not yet achieved mediocrity" - the same can be said for the utterly forgetful songs. In short, Darshan's latest offer has no boom, bang, wallop or twang. Instead, it just stays with the head and hoped to catch your attention with a soft touch on the shoulder. And it is not good enough at all.
