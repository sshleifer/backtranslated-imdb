The fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all disappeared with this third effort, which means that the rubbish production values ​​show more than ever. Another 2-party ('The Chinese Web') cobbled together, this suffers from too much padding, not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired places as a car park, apartment and printing house. Nicholas Hammond is as demanding as ever, and fights fiercely against the slaughter's production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. The plot where Peter and Spidey help a Chinese official seize corruption during World War II by finding three marines who could testify to his innocence, not even shouting 'cartoon triggered to life', does it?
