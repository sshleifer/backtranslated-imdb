I thought it was weird and just gory, not scary. I've seen a couple of Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. It never even explained anything about the curse. I just didn't see any horror ... it wasn't scary for me at all. The whole time I looked, I waited for Kirie to discover the mystery of the curse and why it happened now. If it was an old curse, why didn't it happen before Shuichi's father? And it never told us what happened to his father. I waited for someone to tell us the meaning or reasoning behind this curse, and then it just ended. I was very disappointed.
