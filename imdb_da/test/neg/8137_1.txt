Barbara Payton is the additional hungry sexy young hot Chickie wife from the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungle back very much on a cheap study in Hollywood. Raymond Burr carries his work dress with the top button indefinitely as the hunky chunky plantation foreman whom Mrs Payton wants to blow with. There is another girl, a kind of peasant slave thing that Burr used to trick around with, but he has given her the old heave ho, so the mandatory squatty old voo-doo hag is a strong spell to throw at him and Payton trampling. I saw this only partly because it was really awful, so it wasn't even seeing the star's show --- which I think is a gorilla, which for anyone's sake turned someone to or anything ... And so what. I give this half a star out of a possible ten. It's not even campy, just really bad.
