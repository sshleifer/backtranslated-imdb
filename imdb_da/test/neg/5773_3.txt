Oh dear, dear. It really comes to my nerves when a low budget, meaningless horror affair tries to look interesting in the credits by having a bunch of good names pop up in the casting, only to involve each one in the smallest and most meaningless possible roles. In this movie we have Richard Lynch in a scene, an instant appearance from Martin Kove, a short place for Vernon Welles, a little more time on the screen for John Philip Law and some time for Karen Black. This bunch of random cameos doesn't take up much, though Richard Lynch and Karen Black raise some of the few smiles of this movie with their looks, and it's quite painful as none of the main casts are very good. I couldn't help but think that if several scenes were filmed with any of the b movie veterans over, the movie would be a whole lot better, but like that, there are just a few exciting flashes of good entertainment without filming ever get much entertainment value. Of the most important casts, the only charismatic or similar notions in my opinion were Steve Wastell, like Axel and his girlfriend, whom I think was played by Elina Madison (never heard of her before, but she has some degree of screen presence and is a good one appearance). The plot of this is simple, vicious undead miner goes for those who want to steal their gold, and it should make a good slasher fun, especially as it is considered by John Carl Buechler, who has made special effects for many of these kinds of movies, including having worked on all three major slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday 13th) and such small gemstones as the Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film is lacking in excitement, equality and satisfactorily. There are one or two mildly gory moments, but nothing worth the effort to watch the movie, I wouldn't say. In fact, apart from the above mentioned cameos the whole movie is really quite outdated and turgid with signs that couldn't get offed fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate lack of any real interest. I didn't even find it fun in a ridiculously bad movie feeling, which is rare for me as I love a lot of beautiful movies. I would say avoid.
