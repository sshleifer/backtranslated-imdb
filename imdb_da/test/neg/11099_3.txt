The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not what I had ever heard of it before, but Belphégor has been a popular topic before for movies and mini-series. The first film was released far back in 1927, at the same time as the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his most famous creations. <br/> Once upon a time, Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who wanted to conquer Hollywood. However, she has now fallen back to movies like this. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality films, as it is the country she originated from, but this movie is just ridiculous. The problem is mostly due to the fact that the film relies on its special effects to make the film good and frightening. Well, scare and special effects have never really been a good combination, though with some exceptions here and there. It is not like the special effects are bad in this. Especially for a European movie, it is simply good, but it is just wrong placed when the film gave the feeling it could have done without having effect. It would actually have made the movie a better and frightening look, no doubt about it really. <br /> <br /> The movie is just never exciting or engaging to see, even though the movie seems to have difficulty choosing the right approach. At times, the film chooses an easy and less serious approach, while in others it clearly tries to be a good scary horror movie. This is mostly the reason why the film just doesn't pull out at any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It all also gets worse towards the end. After a while, you just stop to care about this movie and its story, and you begin to wish you had decided to see something else instead. The editing works completely free. It uses for quick cuts without much style, while the quick editing was obviously meant to give the film a good and modern style. Also, the timeline is simply cleared up as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The musical score is also very annoying and sometimes doesn't even sound like movie, as if it has long before the movie finished shooting. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The musical score is almost as annoying as the movie's sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with many characters that you just couldn't care less about. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau will ever fall for a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. The film also includes Julie Christie, who is nice, but does not add much to the film. <br /> <br /> A horrible clock. <br /> <br /> 3/10
