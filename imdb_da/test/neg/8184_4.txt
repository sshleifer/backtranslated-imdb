I hardly managed to see the whole movie ... Only after approx. 85 minutes out of the movie's 110 minutes, the journey to Mars began and there were 5 minutes back to the closure. These 85 long minutes were very boring and did not contribute to the movie. When you finally reached Mars, it was not much better plot wise. It could all have been mounted in much shorter time, and nothing would have been missed. What I can't understand is the piece of trivia that says because of the movie, newborn babies were called "Aelita" ... Why would anyone want to name their baby after a villain who, despite having only one eyebrow, has apparently 3 breasts ??? The only interesting thing here are sets and costumes for Mars scenes. They are an interesting experiment in constructivism, just as "Dr. Caligari's cabinet" was for expressionism five years earlier. I give it 4/10 for the great design ...
