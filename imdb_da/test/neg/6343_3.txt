I know that these types of movies sell tickets and serve to film producers, but it just won't do as a movie about Vietnam. Viet Nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived day in and day out. <br /> <br /> This movie star Gene Hackman, a Korean war lawyer, is tasked with training a group of rag-tag Viet Nam Vets for a return flight to that country to save a group of US POWs held in a camp there. These men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy oxygen-descending sailor, a blonde tanned California surfer, and some inexperienced children (Patrick Swayze) who just happened to have a father killed in Nam. They train first in a camp in Texas, and once in Nam they are found out and lose all their weapons. They are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men. Most of the men are found and saved, but the rag tag group is mostly wiped out. <br /> <br /> This movie played as a video game where you could find out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of what bush and who would die and who would live. Viet Nam I guess wasn't like a video game ....
