Without actually giving away my age I saw it for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape ??) and I was old enough to drink (barely) and maybe had I had a couple because I remember thinking about how big this movie was! I have since seen it sober and must admit it is a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is quite ridiculous and the poor trades just make it worse. It's a bad attempt to fantasize that teenagers can also be "Mavericks" (though I'm surprised to find that it should actually be released at the same time (aprox) as "Top Gun" and didn't actually mean to be a bad imitation.) But for everyone it is worth it - I find myself seeing it if it is on and I have time. It's one of the movies you see because it's just so ridiculous and so desperately trying to take it seriously. Like the other "big" movie - "Moment by Moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin .... don't get me started on the one!
