<br /> <br /> Never ever take a movie just for its great title. <br /> <br /> Although it all starts well, the movie has the same imperfections you see in B movies. It is like a certain moment no longer how to finish the movie, so he ends it in a way that does not suspect it is thinking this way, he is brilliant. A movie to be listed on top of the garbage game. <br /> <br />
