I remembered this horrible movie I bought at the Camelot Music Store in the summer of 1989 when I visited my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Return of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genre to offer .... or I thought! I was only about 12 years old at that time, so I really can't remember it all as well. I remember that a psycho runs around with a corkscrew that kills people, and a few cops (I think) who drove in a car that didn't actually move, but to be rocked side by side to look as if it were ... true biographical. I also remember that it was the worst movie I had ever seen up to that point and I immediately threw it into the garbage. <br /> <br /> Something tonight made me think of that movie (I can't believe I actually remembered the name) so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise ... IT WAS! And quite a few other 5 people have seen it .... Amazing. Even though I remember retrieving the movie at that time, I had a wish that I had kept it away somewhere because I would love to check it out again for a laugh (it would probably make a good drinking movie). Anyway, I'm glad I'm part of the elite who saw this little "treasure". I would love to pick it up somewhere for a few bucks .... but beware, it's not a recommendation ... it's terrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
