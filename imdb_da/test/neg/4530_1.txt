The audience sat in silence through almost the entire movie, with few, rare, occasional chuckles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent, I felt whip-lashed. When it is practical for the plot, Smart behaves like a master spy. At other times, he seems like an imbecile. They lift many classic lines from the TV series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "missed it so much" is fun if it is spoken with attempts at braggadocio by a person who is a manifest failure - but it loses all humor when you speak of someone who is qualified. To a lesser extent, many of the other characters move at a staggering pace from skilled to comic incompetent. Siegfried, the greatest villain, seems to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that do nothing at all. Yet none of the characters in the film are as incompetent as the authors of this mess. I am totally depressed that so many IMDb users believe this was good.
