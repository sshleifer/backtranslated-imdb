Joe Rogan's entire action is the whims twisted with bile. He is a pot smoker who came into the fear factor and thought it was a joke. He said he would put people on because he didn't know how stupid people should be. The producers of the show, he explained, went on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting participants to see how far they would go. The evil level involved is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special is just filled with rants by someone who is too good for ordinary people. I found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes a five-minute set of the N-word. Generally ignore this particular.
