This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of good actors. But the script was terrible! It seemed to be mostly just a framework work where Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And he does best, but it just didn't work here. The scripture was hard to follow, the story was non-sensual, and scenes were random and lacking in direction. Also much of the action was extremely constructed and poorly thought out. It was a good bet, but as Max says, they missed it by so much! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stink here on IMDb. Of course, film producers get people to write many positive reviews on their movies and fill in the records on IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them with the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which are genuine reviews from normal users. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never even laughed while watching this movie. Yes, I had a few bright moments, a few chuckles, but no real laughs. Nothing struck me at all. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! A ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands tied on the plane and he goes to the toilet to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss army knife ... but instead of just using the BLADDLE, he tries to shoot the bond with his miniature cross. And when the elbow misses and shoots little arrows into him again and again (almost exhausting his EYE) Max does not give up or try the blade instead ... no, he just keeps shooting himself with the armrest. What did he really expect to do with this armbue? It seemed to be the WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bindings. It just made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> It is a good example of the typical circumstances of the scenes that made this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense. And it was really distracting. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big disappointment and I recommend you avoid it. A note to IMDb: You need to do something about these false reviews that people leave. It destroys the site's authenticity.
