Death Island is not really a good movie, by any standard, but it is a curious one. Imagine if Natural Born Killers was made 20 years early, like a Greek Eurotrash porn movie. That's what you come here - the peculiar story of a young, sociopathic British couple who cuts a deadly forest through the population on a lovely little Greek island. <br /> <br /> I save you a detailed overview of the plot; It is not really important except to create more and more perverted or violent sex scenes followed by disturbing brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple. It could have been brilliant, in its own sick and unpleasant way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I found myself impatiently checking running time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade should last. Slow pacing and noisy, bland plays make even the most difficult perversions to pummel, linking scenes into an eternity of boring plodding. Oh yes. You can't win them all.
