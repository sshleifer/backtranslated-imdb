You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque on Carmen boring, imaginative and not fun at all. <br /> <br /> Chaplin tells Carmen's story and plays a major role even as Don Jose. It's a story of men and women they love, even though it's not quite clear why one would love such a woman as Carmen, as she plays the men against each other. As I said, I didn't think much of it. Chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm curious about the difference between this movie and the 1915 version ... or is it just a bug in IMDB? <br /> <br /> On the whole: 3/10.
