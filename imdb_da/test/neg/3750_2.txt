Martha Plimpton has made some prestigious films working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she could never extend her limited, boisterous appeal to the same class as, "says Molly Ringwald. This film, which was almost unpublished, is merely an extension of her late 80's / early 90's attempt to find a screen persona that could be identified by film gamers, and it represents another failure. Plimpton plays a worried young woman who finds out her 21st birthday that she was adopted, and - worse than that - was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! She goes out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why she herself would (would simple curiosity give her this very determination?). Unattractive material provided sitcom handling; It starts on the wrong foot and never restores. Plimpton gives a sour, surly performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as their adoptive parents. * 1/2 from ****
