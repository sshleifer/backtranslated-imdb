This movie should be one of the most boring movies ever made. All I liked was to use Argento-esquire lighting in most scenes. The music is horrible and the pace is so slow that you can see it at 2x speed and even then it would be slow. The story does not exist. It doesn't even have any shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (on this site at least) as a horror, but it is not. It is a kind of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you are in that kind of thing and can stand slowly, then see it, but I'd rather recommend you some Japanese (eg Ichi the Killer). I think the only reason this movie was never in theaters is a fear of the audience committing collective suicide caused by the tremendous amount of boredom generated by this movie. These 80 minutes of its length would have been better spent watching paint dry. I gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu
