I went to watch this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was too much for me. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen or (especially) a kid to this movie. It was raw and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews I had seen for it. I had originally seen examples of it at Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty sweet (maybe I just don't remember previsting properly). Plus, Drake Bell (the film's protagonist) stars on a Nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teens. I really didn't think the movie's content would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research on it before I went. But I hope parents will read this movie before they take their children to see it just because it has Drake Bell in it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, DO NOT take your children or teenagers to watch this movie. The character should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disruptive events throughout the movie. Examples: Drake Bell is being attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes involving men tackling women's breasts, lots of fate, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla (or so), people are hit, hit, and wounded in movies, and an older lady and her dog are shredded. There are many other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really degrading for women in general. The movie is of the people who made the Scary Movie series, so it should tell you something right there. Remember to watch movies like this can give children and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers cannot decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this movie is typical of its genre. But I find the possibility that children and teenagers will see this movie HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the movie, I didn't think it was original or funny. It pulled in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. The action was not too bad, considering how bad the script was. If you are an adult or an older teen looking for a fun movie, skip this or rent it.
