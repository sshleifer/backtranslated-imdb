I love oddball animation, I love many Asian movies, but I didn't love this particular product from Japan. Fuccons are apparently an American family (they are all mannequins) who have moved to Japan, and they are some 50-year-old sitcom family, with sometimes more modern feelings at times. The DVD contains several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?), And I didn't find it fun or entertaining, not even in a strange way. I'm not sure what the appeal is about this. I picked up some satire here and there, gosh, who wouldn't, but satire is usually a little humorous, isn't it? And nothing I saw or heard judged even a little smirk. I picked this up used and it certainly sounds appealing, but I guess either I'm missing the point or it's just plain LAME. The box even says that it is Fuccon fun, right there on the front, but I ask to depart. 2 out of 10
