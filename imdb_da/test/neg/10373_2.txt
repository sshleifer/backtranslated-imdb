Being a gay man who lived through the period studied in this dull documentary was eager to see how the subject was being dealt with. Unfortunately, the filmmakers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed light on our collective homosexual history. This movie only concerns the period in New York City that ignores the rest of the country. While spending a lot of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than any other in the 70's, and here they are again, growing nostalgic and still throwing in mind. The film should have at least attempted to cover major issues such as race, old age, the emerging gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image, and the emergence of "clones", discrimination of subgroups in society, and the ability to grow a decent mustache. (which was very important in the 70s!). Unfortunately, none of these have been presented and reminds that the interviewees are no different than my own memories. If you were there for the decade, you will enjoy the archive images and grainy home movies from the bars and discos we visited. If you weren't there, this movie will undoubtedly be boring. It should have been so much more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars for jogging my memory ... I still miss going to Anvil!
