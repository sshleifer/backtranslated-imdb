When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but flawless film. The ground was greedy and satisfying - even though the actor was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to rehash the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie, but certainly almost like "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the study had apparently given up on something new for Mrs Grier, as SHEBA, BABY was essentially the same plot from COFFY and FOXY BROWN once again. Because the idea was so recycled and because the actor and actor are so tired and low energy, it really scrapes the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel. <br /> <br /> Just like these other movies, SHEBA, BABY begins with some local black mobsters presses and eventually kills any Pam Grier lover. Previously, it had been drug dealers and pimps, now it was mobsters trying to drive all loan companies and peasant shops out of town so they could corner the market. And like the other movies, Pam is a one-woman hit squad - dispensing justice and a good butt whoopin '. And like the other movies, there is a "cat fight" between Pam and a white lady right in front of "Mr. Big". And like the other movies, Mr. Big a white guy pulling all the strings. And like the other movies, she's caught by Mr. Big. And like the other movies, he doesn't kill her immediately, but gives her ample opportunity to escape (here a knife conveniently lies). And like the other movies, she eventually gets free and kills his jive - @ $$. While this formula seemed interesting in 1973, with this film, it was honestly a predictable drilling. Although you hadn't seen the other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - punching and kicking seemed so slow and staged. The same could be said for the gun. In one scene, four boys with machine guns, an AR-15 and shotgun attack. Pam responds by opening a fire with a .357 revolver and killing 3 out of 4 and getting the other to surrender !!! Although she is a good shot, she was pretty slow and the boys just seemed to wait until she killed them !!! Yet even a world champion or Rambo could not have achieved such one-sided odds - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointing to her when she "wisely" whipped out the gun and easily shipped these professional hit men !! <br /> <br /> In addition to the slow and lame action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation movie, the movie has many logical gaps that show the writing was horrible, but the studio just didn't care. In one case, her boyfriend knew "Williams" about the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the movie, but Pam never told him. How did he know about this? In another, the police approaches a boat filled with caps, and the cap immediately opens fire. But the police had no evidence that happened, and the bad guys started shooting with a little provocation. And the bad guys had .30 caliber machine guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by police with snub-nosed .38s! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a good example of "Been there / done it ... a whole lot better". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this one is just too drowsy and slow to tell, except for very devoted fans of the genre.
