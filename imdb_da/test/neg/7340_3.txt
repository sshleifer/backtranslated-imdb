I lived in Barstow approx. in 1968, when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to make me pay my hard earned money to watch this movie. I was really expecting a Bonnie And Clyde movie, and I got Dick Clark playing a shy nerdy guy while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played a little attempt to revive Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say it never went well. Maybe that's why it never made video. Even as a child, I was a little left, who ripped off when I left the theater. After all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. The movie was boring and pretty much meaningless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it was not a total disappointment.
