I classify this as the worst movie all the time. <br /> <br /> If there was ever a movie I wanted on my enemies, it would be. The reason is ridiculous, there are only 2 signs, and the coincidences between these characters are absolutely complete beliefs. <br /> <br /> These factors combine to make this an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother went into the movie about 15 minutes. I figured that a movie that was boring and slow * should have some cool interesting plot twist, and one was pretty disappointed as nothing exciting materialized. <br /> <br /> I was briefly considering sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours lost life.
