This movie didn't bother me. On vacation in Turkey, I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, but the story draws in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't quite follow is how Gone could get the money to bribe the guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing I didn't particularly like was the lack of Khan's life. It did not go into detail about how the evil ones could find him and imprisoned him again after he had been missing for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider this movie a (4) because I enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating, as the dialogue left me less than impressed ...
