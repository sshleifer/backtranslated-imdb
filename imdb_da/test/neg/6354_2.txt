They have to be. I will list them so you can check them from one to one: <br /> <br /> - The police regularly leave tens of thousands of dollars of cash and drugs just around because they don't have proof facilities. <br /> <br /> - When you get shot, you always think the same way and fly the same way, even if there is never a mark on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are unable to identify the sound of gun shots and do not think anything is suspected when an undercover policeman's phone call during a high-drug-and-money deal is cut shot by The gun shot. <br /> <br /> - Bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with a shot, but cannot hit a huge, voluminous martial artist with 100. <br /> - If you rocket launch a car in a parking lot The next three cars in a line blow evenly in 15 second intervals. <br /> <br /> - Next to the last point, all the cheap cars are parked side by side. <br /> <br /> - The smoke caused by the firing of the rocket launcher is much larger than the amount of smoke caused by four cars jumping up. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games, which are a long, long way ahead of anything that any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games, a long, long way ahead of everything another gaming company can produce, have graphics similar to Windows 3.1 screen-specific. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can be read right after they are shot up. <br /> <br /> - Half-filled guys in bars pay close attention to the news when they are in the pub, and have a deep understanding of American modern military history, Agent Orange, and family trees of senior military officials. But they can only articulate their points using a dialogue that sounds silly from anyone over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Although the matches seem to break out almost every hour in a bar, this bar has only one employee who both puts beer and handles security. Of course he knows martial arts. - Gold Medal Olympians regularly make the easy transition to software company executives over the years. <br /> <br /> - A woman working for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played, is constantly raving about her competitor's big game and can rattle off facts and figures about the company's rivals - but she did not know that they took over almost all the other companies in the field in large business associations. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys always die in slow motion. Always. - Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant by raving about their husband's bravery by killing evil guys. <br /> <br /> - Wives make huge amounts of their husband's police work; This can explain why she cheats and complains so much every time he has to go to work. Although it does not explain why she loves him so much every time he gets up in the morning, she can read about her murderous escapades. It's quite typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings, kill lots of people on three separate occasions, and stop a number of millions of dollars of illegal deals in a week. <br /> <br /> - When trying to lose a car that follows you, it is wise to continue driving below the speed limit. And if you follow a policeman, subtlety is not important - you can back him off for miles and then park right next to him. He won't notice. <br /> <br /> - All police are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a guy four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or groan in pain when they are stopped or kicked, but when they have their arm broken, they do not sound. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys cleanse their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs and leave them in their pocket for many days. <br /> <br /> - Wood pieces, when swung with a sharp stroke, destroy stable rises in six or more places simultaneously. <br /> <br /> - The photo and the special features listed on the back of the DVD case do not necessarily have to be on the DVD. They announced interactive menus? Why not any menu at all! The announced stage index? Why not have it all as a scene / chapter and not need an index! Also, it is OK to use The Matrix's font and title in the tag line and not be a rip-off in any way. <br /> <br /> With all this I am in shock that 12 out of the 15 top-rated actors have never acted again.
