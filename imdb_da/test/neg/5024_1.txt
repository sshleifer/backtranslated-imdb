May or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. In fact, it is very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just draws on ... and beyond ... and beyond ... That's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress. And fillers are just the same stories that are repeated over and over again. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagome sensing a jewel shard, a worm / slime / tentacle demon thing pops up, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer" etc. And kills the demon, they get jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times. In addition to repeating episodes, there are repeated comedic units and they are no longer fun. Wait, they were never. Sexual harassment is not fun. Viz classified the series Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it. There is nothing bad about it except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is a little suggestive, and it could make you arrest these days. We know that Inuyasha is overestimated. Video arrows. They all sucked. Especially Mask games. I played it in my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slowly boring and it had the Nintendo 64 as graphics. In a magazine, it received a rating of 4/10 and said "... this role play is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw." Then there are all those stupid Inuyasha toys, action characters, trading cards, stickers and coloring books. Coloring Books! We thought Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not ... But having been a member of Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half of people were there 10 to 13. I think Inuyasha is a little kid anime after all. (I think only a little bit of editing for this show, it could be displayed on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga amounts. I can only wonder how many miles of forest have been cut to get them. Sad ... <br /> There is the music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs each episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes really annoying. In other anime they have music to fit the mood and we do not hear any songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don't waste your money on that waste! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know all this? Because I used to be a fan of Inuyasha. I am ashamed of myself. I'd rather see Kim Possible or Pokemon instead. Unfortunately, the two shows have more romance between the two main characters than Inuyasha ever wants ...
