Only if the title didn't give it away - is this movie garbage. <br /> <br /> Brief Review? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend so much time writing this review that Hollywood probably decided to put into the script. I doubt it will be published considering how badly I formulated everything, but if this is and someone reads it - stick to the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. The sequels are never worth buying or watching, and everyone involved in making them shameful to destroy what should be one of the most classic, original films in our childhood.
