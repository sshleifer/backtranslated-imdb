Most likely, "Cleopatra 2525" would be of little interest if you didn't see the series when it was broadcast; And I don't think many people did it. But if you are still a little excited, it is a "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" premise without spaceships and without budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, the Jennifer Rogers section (Cleopatra) is played. Which one can expect to be a good thing when Jennifer is very handsome and quite talented; and has a good comic touch. But a quick glance at the promotional material will show that she is somewhat worse off having a bad hairdresser and a salvation army thrift wardrobe. If you remember how the download of Jennifer was in her time at "Xena", her little Cleopatra look will be a big disappointment. With an audience of "teenage boys looking to burn their eyes, they look at" hot fetish-attired girls, "it's not a good idea to cheat the exploit value of your heroine or her costume. And they wonder why some series do not attract much from an audience, love it or hate it, "Buck Rogers" had warmer costumes and much better guest stars. The other two exploits are Cleopatra's two female employees; Hel (Gina Torres basically plays "Firefly" character) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt-another "Xena" connection - an extreme wood version of Natasha Henstridge.) Torres does a good job with the Cleopatra character and gives most of the show's comic relief. /> <br /> Torres sings the theme song , a paralyzed parody of Rick Evans' "In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969). You remember the one who opens with the words "In the year 2525, If man still lives, women can survive if they can find ... "I suppose they gave t he series his title so that they could slaughter this captivating little song, even if it knows, perhaps the title is a tribute to "Buck Rogers" and they were thinking of using the song later. <br /> <br /> So the starting point of the show is that the Earth's surface has been taken over by foreigners called Bailies (not the WKRP) and humans have been driven underground. Our three Allies fight against Bailies under the guidance of a disembodied (presumably) female voice (appropriately referred to as "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a bit of a wimpy third stooge that is still confused and confused by its cryogenic sleep or perhaps just disoriented from the creepy haircut. There are many nice close-ups of Sky knowing and confused. As "Buck Rogers" is the on-going gag Cleopatra using a common 21st century expression and everyone finds it either deep or completely confusing. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly", the action is more of the hyper-edited "Xena" waste, which is neither realistic nor entertaining. A good gimmick is that the girls travel around "Spiderman" fashion, a kind of web that winds through tunnels and axles in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strangely (or perhaps not considering the budget) it's only half hour episodes, and with the exception of a two-part show, there's not enough time for any subtlety and nuance. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
