This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. What were they thinking about. Stop preaching me already! That's why we all see Walker Texas Ranger and won't admit it to our friends. Terrible play and an extremely fake plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops, and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed the two broken wells. It looked like crap! When I saw the title of my local blockbusters it looked interesting. Their should have been a warning to say that it was religious rather than the false advertising of an action / adventure. For the first time in a long time, I stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate ending it.
