I just watched Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas and I must express my dissatisfaction. The initial caption tries to tell us that the film is a depiction of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica in this case) by North American oil companies and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple and comfortable life in maintaining a banana color. Immediately a woman comes and announces that she is the wife's half sister. I do not want to go into details about this (and to be honest, I do not feel that I am indulging in this review), another important point is that the company they distribute their bananas loses because of that budget requirements in a bad economy. So the most important conflict to be dealt with in the movie is by the man between the rock and the hard place and trying to maintain his livelihood. On the one hand, Reynold's oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the city to let the company begin drilling in their city (compromising its position with society and society self). On the other hand, he is facing death, but beside his community, the drilling protests. Given the length of this movie, it would have been plenty of time to investigate the problems just described, but it just doesn't happen and I tell you why. You will notice that this movie has won a few prizes so far, one for direction and one audience prize. I don't want to pick Esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing something. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain, and to get an audience prize, I had to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas. In fact, Central and South America also digs soap operas, I know a lot. I suppose Esteban either aims to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that's what unfolds during this movie so much to the point that it kicks the entire oil company almost aside as if they imagined halfway through the film's presentation, it had become tedious, for it appears that at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development seriously compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of those three characters, and in no time do you actually find out who the hell he is. It's almost like they cut their screen time just as little as taking him out of the movie altogether. From time to time they play with the oil against the community complex, but at best they are excavations. What we see much more about is passionate scenes, jealousy, scams, adultery, etc. These themes saturate history to such an extent that the oil company's subplot becomes unnecessary. It's almost like this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing a little politically relevant. Nevertheless, the film is so keen on romance that it ultimately does not know what to do with itself, resulting in an end, so thanks to you wondering what you have been expecting on or if there was ever something to start with. Here are two things I think might have saved this movie: either cut the half-sister out or cut out the oil company. Obviously, which of the two were more interested in. Or maybe if Caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked everything together. Regardless, I would have been fine with a straight-up soap opera, and I think the subject of oil companies utilizing foreign countries has a great need to handle the film community. Caribe is both and not. These two angles could have worked together if they had been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot that runs around circles and takes almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil barrel that is almost non-established. both sides . Best of all, the romance plot has never even been resolved. I want to say that I want to see this movie again to see what I have missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I was concerned, it would be nothing if I saw Caribe ten more times. I missed it because it simply isn't there.
