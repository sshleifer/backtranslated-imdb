What did Wes think of doing this dribble? It doesn't work well with any of his other work, but he seemed to fall again in a slight decline after making a nightmare on Elm Street. This can be seen from his follow-up 1.Invation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the Rainbow 6.Shocks all these movies were either mediocre our crap it was not before People Under the Stairs that He got his speed back and started kicking ass again. Chiller has none of Craven's fixed and none of his tensions. The only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after graveling for his job.
