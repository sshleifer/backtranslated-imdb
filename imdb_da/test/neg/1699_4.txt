If you are a Catalan nationalist anarchosocialist with the subconscious reverence for the mythology of the Spanish Republic, this movie may be for you. Two brothers, the real ones (one of them is Marc Recha himself), resume a fictional version of a real journey they had made through the spectacular Catalan landscape, and the story is evoked (bullet-walled walls, artillery boom on the soundtrack), but not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it is random: the story is told in a third-person voice-over, the voice is that of an actor who publishes the real life sister of the real brothers. The pictures have a bit to do with what the story is, which is not much. Many are amazing, bursting pans across powerful half-rocky mountains and rivers (think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there's not a bit of both "Gerry" and "Last Days" here), mixed with some amazing stills and motionless frames. These are best enjoyed in the movie's stunning natural sound environment and without the ultimate boring narrative or even occasional background music (some quite good, some rather strange but all free). The best of what this film has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional commentary inclusion of power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers is left out sketched and generic; A great character is a man-biting catfish, never shown. The more the Catalan-nationalist anarcho-independent responsibilities of the director are proposed, the more the richer, unspoken message of the film is undermined, and the more annoying the narcissistic experience becomes. Although the director said at the NYFF screening that the film was seen from the beginning with its third person's story, I would like to see a version of it without the story or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue - the result can be more moving and would Anyway, don't be so very confusing. <br /> <br /> It's probably the only movie you'll see this year when a guy enters the frame with a cloth object (the swimsuit he was wearing?) dangling from his penis. This is one of the few moments in the whole movie, where your interest is (excused) dotted with something that actually happens on the screen (what is it? Why is it hanging there?), But as usual, no answer is given. Very Warholian, very sixties, and a little tiring.
