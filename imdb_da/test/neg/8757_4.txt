Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Facts, I had never even heard of it a few months ago. But being a collector of almost all kinds of horror, I figured I would go ahead and grab this blurred 80's slasher. Basically, history has been related to a killer who kills every 5 years for 5 nights. in a row. What the third 5 in the title means ... no one knows. Still, the killings that the killer is looking for young teens begin to trick around in blurry places. He beheads the men and brutally knives the woman to death. Then he continues to rape the dead body. The police believe they have the killings, but really have no idea what is happening. How will they find the killer? Does anyone worry? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder none of these actors kept doing anything else literally. The three main actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's almost as sexy as it gets. The two detectives are like watching tweedles and tweedles stupid. One of them supports his part, and the other may have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. The action is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie and thus almost put you to sleep. The only thing that holds this horrible movie together is a few decent scenes. For a movie on this budget, decision makers must have put all the money into the special effects that are still not that big. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and have to own every horror movie there I would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4.10
