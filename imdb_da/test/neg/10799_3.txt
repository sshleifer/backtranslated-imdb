Firstly, I have read the comments from the director further down and I would like to thank him for offering his opinion. I have always wondered what the film producers of the paralyzed movies on MST3K felt about their works being shredded (not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights). Rissi's comments make me curious how much Sci-Fi could have cut the film to make it look different (now I think I can rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the unknown, non-MST3K version of this movie, but even after watching it on MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something obscure (though I thought it was a pretty funny MST3K episode ); certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "skin peeling terribly"; not after seeing "Future War" and "Hobgoblins." <br /> <br /> As far as cutting the movie is concerned, it has been done before at MST3K, at least once. Case in point: Joe Don Baker flick, Mitchell, where the partial plot involving John Saxon's character is cut in the MST3K version, but Joel and Bots comment on Saxon's absence after his appearance at the beginning of the movie. If I can file a criticism of MST3K if you need to cut the movie for time considerations, fine, but be fair about the movie being cut (though it's a miserable movie like Mitchell). Of course, such a criticism is rather meaningless as to what the show is over, but I think the aspect of the show was a little unfair. But anyway, if so with Soultaker, it gets my sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, I maintain that it is an enjoyable MST3K episode, even though the movie itself, even the version that has been "hacked" in MST3K, is not so dreadful. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in a strange case or perhaps a case of Synchronicity, I happened to see The Hudsucker Proxy Day Soultaker aired and wouldn't you know the guy playing Vivian Schelling's father had a bit of that movie; One of his three other credited roles, in fact. I thought it was a little strange.
