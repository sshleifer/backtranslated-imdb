This is a bad excuse for a movie. A movie noir performed by Busbee Berkeley? Please! Let's first forget the plot, a really simple minded version of a cynical hard guy turned into a saint of love for a beautiful blonde. Yechh. So what turns her away from despising him to love him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a child from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is seeped and stretched. It's not exactly heroics, but she's suddenly beaten. It is really painful to see Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, hard-spoken, noir-type policeman. A curly grimace is his main and rather pathetic play, along with a rough voice. Most of his energy seems to try to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever talked to taking this job, I never understand. Enjoy it if you can, for a few details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent movie experience. It wasted 1-1 / 12 hours in my life.
