This film is no more than Christian propaganda. It started out as a good sci-fi movie and then works on a syrupy sweet Christian theme into history, which is completely independent. I had to turn it off halfway because I felt fooled to rent it. The Catholic Church has officially announced that foreigners do not contradict faith in God. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie is a bit entertaining, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and acting are mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stink to be avoided. Of course, there was something that was done by the film authorities in the phenomenon, but then you quickly realize that it is only intended to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a validly interesting topic. If you are an avid religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
