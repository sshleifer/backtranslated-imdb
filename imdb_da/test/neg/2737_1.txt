This movie is just a good movie if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist, this movie plays most of the important facts wrong and uses actors who are too young to be considered at the top of their fields. It is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caves beneath the earth's surface. It is also fun how seismically active areas appear to have massive destruction from an earthquake of 6.5 magnets. They seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher, requiring a major earthquake to do so much damage. It's also fun how much they make the coastline of Washington State and also Oregon to look like they are beautiful beaches in Southern California. The jelly-donut analogy is very entertaining, though the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief to the two "supossed" PhDs.
