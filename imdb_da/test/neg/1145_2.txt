I'm a fan of some of the Vacation movies, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's out of steam. Made for TV National Lampoon movies don't do well on TV. This movie is another reason. I think many of us were excited when it came out, but we also had to see the reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is fine as a cousin Eddie, but is better in a supporting role than the lead. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to reproduce her role as one of the Griswold children. She's just as beautiful, but it doesn't help a thin script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made for itself? It was probably because NBC recently picked up another couple of years to present X-mas Vacation. There is nothing wrong with the actor. That's all in the script. It's just not that fun. People have to think before they write things like this. It's a Christmas movie, I don't recommend.
