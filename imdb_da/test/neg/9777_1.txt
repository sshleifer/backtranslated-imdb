When I saw the poster at the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast worth trying. But after entering, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many non-sense and logical errors. For me, it's a movie that's not worth putting into theaters. It is not even worth seeing.
