Most of the positive comments posted here are as magnificent as the movie! It takes a long-term drilling to appreciate a proper and boring movie you assume. Some have just called the movie "contemplative", meaning slow and devoid of plot, but a Dutch reviewer hit the nail upside down: This is an important event transformed into a dull movie whose tone is set in the very first scene. Here, a young couple is shown an apartment by a real estate agent who predictably speaks non-stop and whatever happens. It also makes almost all other characters! The only silence in this picture is dream sequences - 1930s Soviet propaganda cut - and they are also its most interesting parts. This tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is. <br /> <br /> The device to record most scenes in extremely close-up - as if looking through a crack in the blinds - gets old fast.
