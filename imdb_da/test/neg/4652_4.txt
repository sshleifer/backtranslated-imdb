Along with his turn in the super-sleazy 'classic' THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), this is considered the ultimate bad Cameron Mitchell horror effort. It's a little too slow for my taste, has zero-like signs in it and not much action until the end, but Mitchell's dedicated key psycho-performance as revenge-minded whack-jobs Vincent Rinard is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, remember you, but definitely fun enough. As a spoof of the low ground that is Hollywood, it is only half-bad; As a horror movie, it is also just fair. And even as a simple vintage exploit, it's just OK. I'm a big fan of the unnecessary free dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the look of the Gazzarri dancers who just reign. Five of them make a crazy hair-thrashin ', floor-sliding', hip-shaking 'go-go dance routine for' Do Not Cry, Look for the Rainbow 'by T-Bones. When you see these ladies jumping around with big smiles on their faces in their fringed bikini top and parachute trousers, it's a crucial reason why I give this a slightly higher rating as usual. Former film make-up man Vincent Rinard ("The Best Since Lon Chaney!") Is looking for people at Paragon Studios. A feedback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk study leader, threw wine in Vinnie's face just as he was lighting a smoke. He is absorbed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before scarring up one side of his face and loses an eye hole (not to mention his beauty). Vincent uses a special serum (described as a blend of truth serum, nerve medicine and special vitamins and minerals), which is now employed by the world-famous Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California. paralyzed victims. They disappear, and the close detectives on the case (led by Scott Brady) seem confused as new "statues" appear at the museum. Vince speaks to herself ("I am a terribly handsome man!"), Chain smoke, mumbles, hitches, and describes how he is "excited" by the sound of a woman's scream. <br /> <br /> He also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what comes to them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a boozy, inept museum tour guide who sees a statue blink, but does not go to the police. Except Max (a real Grade-A moves ... who doesn't even die!) And the stupid police are the other two main roles of women and both are pretty terrible. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged not least to the five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the wax dummies / missing men's stars (I assume she never had time to take a ride on the one missing girl). For some reason, with her annoying baby voice, she also asks Vince to give her a copy of the head that he designs from the latest missing actor (and fiance number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of the neck, but I love it when Mitchell's dry matches his demands "so you can completely retreat to reality." He also wants her to "quiet" for him, which means she was eventually caught in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head pierces, so we must continue to be disturbed by her tall white. The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the above-mentioned go-go girls. She is seen first and foremost, showing that she is thoroughly rhythmically determined by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini. Theresa is tolerable before she speaks, but when you realize her lattice presence, Lorraine Bracco's blur combines with the Lander's sister's airhead mentality, you want Vincent to inject her with the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are first exposed to a scene by her that makes endless demands on the student's honcho and runs around the museum to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but act as a way to poke fun on the Hollywood system in general, I think. And I probably give this movie more credit than it actually deserves. The pluses are few and far between, but include (except Mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to assume that Rinard is severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Yikes, now it's scary. Also in the cast are director John "Bud" Cardos (also production manager) as police officer, James Forrest as film director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender. Many of the people working on this one (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) also worked on the Al Adamson movie BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
