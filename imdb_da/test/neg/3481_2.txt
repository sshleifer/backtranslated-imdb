This movie is very unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they didn't even afford the little luxury; they only work as cardboard cuts. Of course, they had to get real surfers for the surfing competition rolls, so it's a shot picture if they can act. At least Occy did not give a bushel and just went with it. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The one character who called true was portrayed by Gerry Lopez, who didn't work right, he was very much himself. He is quite used to stomping people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I put a newsletter on my laptop as it came on a cable channel late one night. It saved me from having to pay full attention to this stupid little time consuming. No way would I go out of my way to see it.
