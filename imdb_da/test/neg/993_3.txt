Monkee's "Head" is one of the peculiar phenomena I have noticed - that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things in it and give it great deep meanings that its creator has never imagined. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The movie is a power-of-conscious spectacle of The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, sets of pieces, etc. similar to those on their television show. But while the TV show was playing for laughs, it doesn't seem to be played for anything except a kind of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelics imposes. All in all, The Monkees does the same schtick, but now it is "raising awareness" because the grin track is removed. There is no nail humor or meaning to it all; It just drones with colored lights. The music in "Head" should show someone, in addition to the shadow of doubt, that the monks did not have a scrap of songwriting. The songs are mostly garbage; The only one who can even listen is the "Porpoise Song" which opens and closes the movie. But the thing is, it was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and while it is above average for Monkees, it is below the average of Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote to them: You might think it's a really good song, but then you find out who composed it and you're ready over that it's a throwaway. Mike Nesmith's song may be acceptable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones I think what the filmmakers seemed to be "the big number" in the picture, as it is the only song that was released As Show Biz and not cut into a movie montage or dream sequence, but it also falls flat because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I always liked Monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. Well, they were cheesy, but they were so cheerful about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. But then they became ambitious. In "Head" they actually joke about being a produced pop product, but the truth is that they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something that approaches it. "Head" proves that they failed at all points. 1 * out of 4
