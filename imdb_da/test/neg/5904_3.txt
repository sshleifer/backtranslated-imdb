Robin Williams is excellent in this movie and it is a shame that the material is not enough of a fight for him. This can work if you buy into "U-S-A! Number One!" mentality but history wise, nothing much happens. Very sorry because the film really tries to say something and says it with kind regards. It just doesn't pack enough emotional blows.
