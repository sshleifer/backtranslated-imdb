The other lowest rating auditors have summed up this wastewater so perfectly, which seems a little to add. I must emphasize that I have only been given Cockney Filth on my visits from my children who insist on seeing Sunday's omnibus. My God, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it consists entirely of completely irregular signs that are unpleasant to each other, but it is ten times as bad that the next worst could be. The reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spit of his defenders was spot-on. If someone lived in a social environment like this, they would cut their wrists within days. And I can assure anyone who is not familiar with the real East End that it is something more 'ethnically enriched' than you will ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this nadir by the UK television industry. It's bad.
