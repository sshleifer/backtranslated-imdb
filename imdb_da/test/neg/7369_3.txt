Despite decades of tax incentives, the Canadian film industry is becoming increasingly dependent on most African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their original coasts) and Nouvelle-France aka Battle of the Brave is another example of why. More than any other country, the commercial Canadian cinema does not seem to develop its own identity and stuck in pale imitation of other countries' faults. On paper, this historic drama could look vaguely promising. There is certainly a wealth of untapped material in Canada's history when French and English were fighting over and buying and selling the colony, though none of it does the cut here unless you count the odd flash-and-you-miss characters who says "Wolfe is dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no more" before returning to the soap operation. But while this is not a history lesson, it's not a drama or the epic adventure, the new title promises either: there's no fight in the movie unless you count 10 seconds of shelling of fifty re-enactors and a collapsed shed. The city square, which is all we ever see in Quebec, is a pretty obviously lighted studio interior, giving many scenes an old TV miniseries look, like the director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors . What you get for your money is a simple but drawn-out Harlequin romance about convicted lovers who are constantly separated by events without their control, the biggest surprise being that Fabio does not get into the cast. It's the kind of movie where every time two characters are making the animal with two backs, the camera throws over to a comfortable rushing fireplace or waterfall. <br /> <br /> An English-Canadian-French co-production that does not so much reconcile one-time-warring nations and throw any country with a decent tax break in the pot. This massive cash disaster was clearly destined to be Canada's Titanic - though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the movie, not the ship - but turned out to be more like the revolution made on the cheap without the battle scenes, crowds or the few moments threatening to work short against overwhelming odds. Montreal Mirror described it as "so bad that one cannot even find the strength to spot it." It is quite unfair because most of its time, the film looks like a miniseries of the under-80s, the last half hour suddenly becomes very fun, with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps declaring "You will never see your beautiful lover again, cuckold's honor! You pay for this, you both!" and our heroine accused of murder and gasp! - Witchcraft in a test that's fun enough to have been in Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter. Throw in caddish British governors, incredible slaves and Celine Dion in the end, and you have something that sometimes feels like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines aspired to (and still managed to miss game) with his legendary inert period version of World of War, albeit without the dizzying technical incompetence. <br /> <br /> The diversity man David La Haye's diversity seems to be limited to the number of other players he can watch during the movie: he starts to look like Andy Garcia, shortly adopting the Al Pacino Revolution look, flirting with the sharp Tch√©ky Karyo style before becoming a younger Ted Danson as his character ages. While his opening scene where he responds to news of his father's death with an expression similar to waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now, a party with bad action, in fact, gives him the impression of a mediocre support actor who is lucky in a last minute management when the one who was originally thrown, finally read the manuscript and bailed. He shows willing and gives it a go, but the grace and charisma that the part needs is just not there. Billie Piper lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau's leading lady does not completely indicate the screen, even though you occupy the center stage as the peasant girl who is swapping giggly Vincent Perez's corrupt and perverted Intendant Le Bigot (that's really the character's name) the inexorable , drowning, missing Sebastien Huberdeau and, sadly at all, Gerard Depardieu's relieved, revolutionary, dirty, old priest in a dark gray-haired wig. It is a truly pitiful sight to see a unique actor on the absolute rock bottom in his game as he interferes with the movements, looks as if he has not only lost the will to act but the will to live with it. He could obviously not be bothered to hold onto the English dubbing sessions (or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled). A bit odd, he talked about going to retirement for the film's short release. Some short cartoon help is provided by Jason Isaacs in his standard patriotic mode, which convinces Wolfe of Quebec, rather as an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton at speed, while Tim Roth's William Pitt stands on the sidelines with occasional confused smiles by one Being put in a pretty nice hotel with excellent room service and lots of days off, though Colm Meaney's Benjamin Franklin are both in the movie for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour pop their heads around the door for a few minutes but fail to make any impression, cartoon or otherwise.) Supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as the heroine's real and adopted daughters and a striking beautiful Irene Jacob is looking for the whole world as a young Fanny Ardant is all refreshingly good and deserves much better.
