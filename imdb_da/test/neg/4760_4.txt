Susan slept It turned out to be Dick Powell's swan singing as the performing artist on the big screen. Of course, he directed some more movies and often appeared on television until he died. It's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. Frank Tashlin has made so many better movies, I'm still not sure what even made him do this. The principle is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter seeking to do more serious things than the fluff he has written. He had an idea of ​​a film about juvenile delinquency, saw two friendly police officers in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon depositing 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds on his doorstep. She is not a really bad child and they do not want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell during Christmas time. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem? The term jailbait comes to mind immediately. In addition, Powell has a boyfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Susan Sleep Here is an Oscar nomination. The song Hold my hand, which was sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some fun moments together and Alvy Moore like Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough.
