I'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies when you put them together, it's my sweet spot: horrible sleaze. However, you will not get it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are certainly sleaze in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, bound naked to various things. Sleaze, however, is not very spinning. It did not record me very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls were least attractive, nor did they attempt to function as if they were even threatened. They seemed to think more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could score a little crack. <br /> <br /> Forget the effects they were paralyzing to the extreme. Lameness was contributed by the bad play; effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses do not buy into them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple of cameramen from a porn movie and made better. In fact, it may have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it fun. Like that, there are many dark shots where you can't see very clearly and what you can see doesn't look too good. The horror factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada. Zip. Zilch. I've seen kids movies that were more scary. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie trying to be shockingly blurred, but doesn't even come close.
