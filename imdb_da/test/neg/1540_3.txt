From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a little of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognized the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the critics' judgment. Basically, the cool kid, Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt), are going to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigation of the murder is murder detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with the new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite confused by the evidence found on the scene, eg. non-related hair. The plan doesn't seem to be very good because Cassie and Sam are pretty quick, Richard or Justin suspects, it's just a matter of whether they can swing them away. Also contributing to Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. AS. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope with the murder of a challenge thing, but this movie does it in a very stupid way and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Sufficient!
