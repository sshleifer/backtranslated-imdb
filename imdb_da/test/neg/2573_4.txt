Since I'm not a great Steven Seagal fan, I thought it was a great movie. It is clear that his fans are very dissatisfied with this drama lacking an abundance of martial arts and brutal force. <br /> <br /> Gailard Sartain plays a self-claimed patriot of a military in a standoff with ATF for arms violations. He surrenders with the intention of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who is a national doctor who pushes himself to find antidote to the deadly bug that has incapacity in a small town. His grandfather's Indian herbal medicine indicates salvation. <br /> <br /> Notable appearances by L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. She is amazing and seems to have what it takes to take a more challenging role. <br /> <br /> Despite the far-reaching end, this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action.
