After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It was not "hearty" or "wise"; It was just an interaction between all the other "misguided people who came together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences who learned something about each other" films ever made. <br /> <br /> The characters are a stereotypical bouillabaisse - We have Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians, and Homosexuals - and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this one to do. The black mother declares that it is "okay then" when mentioning that another black personality is in church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks love the church), they see the Spanish only able to speak Spanish, when they greet each other or make exclamations, the lesbians do nothing but hugs and kisses (and one of them carries a bandana. Because all lesbian dresses like Ani DiFranco), and the Vietnamese family owns a video store. In L.A. Imagine it. Oh, and the movie is called "What is cooking" because every ethnic family boils a different version of what they think. Thanksgiving dinner should be! The black mother wants cornbread and macaroni and cheese, the Hispanics are shown rolling tortillas, the Vietnamese family are deep-frying rolls; I'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. This is all shown through the well-known tradition of "musical montage", where they play the "Wipeout" of the Surfer, which quickly changes the instruments used in the tune to reflect the respective cultures. Isn't it sweet? Anyway, when the director finishes setting up how different people are, he tries to show the inner mankind as we all share in every race, religion, and culture, by inventing incredible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to handle . It would be a joke to mention what each of these conflicts is, but be sure to really surprise them, that is, if you've slept in the first half of the movie. The theme of "disgraceful family" runs through quite strongly. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are the kind of person who enjoys the new-born movies about the stories of unlikely characters that merge, well, you still won't like this movie. If you like extended food mountings sent around a table, put this in your Netflix queue. But if stereotypes and clich√©s are endearing to you, make sure you ask for this for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
