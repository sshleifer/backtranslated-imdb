Critics love this movie. I found it personally meaningless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I have fallen into the "critics love it" trap and came out who wanted someone to throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning to animal lovers: Don't watch this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and melted. <br /> <br /> To see a good Asian movie, see Africa. To watch a movie about escaped prisoners, see Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
