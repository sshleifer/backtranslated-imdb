The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Life" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she runs an affair with Aiden Quinn, finds a nature documentary on television, where Quinn notes that there are such things - discrete footage edited to a scene, predators and priests are thrown together to capture the moment - all to force connections where no one actually exists. Signs of the nine shorts that make up this movie occasionally spill over into each other's stories, but none of them ever seem to connect. A woman who is preparing for a violent confrontation with her violent father is later seen in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been hosted later, with his present wife, an evening party for an unhappy couple. Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories ever builds on what came before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, The Wonderful, Overlooked "Things You Can Tell Just Looking At Her" also had a brief history of structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more room to breathe and grow. The gimmicky premise for "Nine Life" that each of its nine stories is told in a single, unbroken recording in real time, never allows the movie to build any real dramatic tension or momentum. It's also a pretty visual nasty movie. Interior images are often scary and hard to look at, while other scenes - especially one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents - are annoying with camera work. Considering that this is Garcia's third movie and that he has a respectable story to lead to television, the direction of this movie is quite surprisingly amateurish. Like another filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer Rebecca Miller, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) is focused on the film and character aspects of his film, often to the detriment of film-making. <br /> <br /> Individual scenes touch and even affect. I liked Jason Issac's kissing Robin Wright Pennsylvania's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna lovingly whispers to his wife as she slips into pre-surgical sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole a couple of happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before coming back to it with a phone call from his daughter. But the film (as opposed to "things you can tell just by looking at her") feels more like an exercise than the actual drama. We only look at peoples.
