This film was, of course, made with a very low budget, but should they make it so obvious? It looked like they didn't do anything to get the "future" look in the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building, and all the cars being blasted are from the late 70's (I guess they wouldn't blow up cars that cost more than $ 500) . In addition, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" runs his personal car during the film (he partially funded the film). Finally, at the beginning of the film, they point out that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. Not only will this never be important in the movie, but later, when he needs surgery without anesthesia, why not just go out and get legal heroin or morphine? The whole movie is sloppy like this and totally anticlimatic, as Don easily blows an "unstoppable" cybertracker about 25 minutes into the movie. But if you find this movie cheap or free, I will see it, the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole movie.
