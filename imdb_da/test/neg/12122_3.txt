Low budget mystery. A shot is shaken out of the dark and a woman is seen to run from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a dead body missing. The woman busy, Mary (June Clyde), is attached to the death scene; But it is McMillan who is trying to resolve the matter to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners near the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; But not quite the right thing. This flick patterns just enough to be a decent low budget mystery / drama and is a nice little escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
