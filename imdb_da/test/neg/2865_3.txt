I really enjoyed more movies by GÃ©rard Depardieu and expected me to like this movie than I did. The biggest reason was that I didn't find the movie very interesting or fun - so it didn't keep my interest. Though he does not sleep with his haughty daughter, the idea that she is lying is telling everyone that he is her much older lover, just icky! Yes, I know there is no incest, and I know no one around them knows that he really is her father, but I found out that every child passes his father, since her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from really being fun. Besides, I really didn't like this little abrupt lot. Apart from her lies, she seemed very sassy and self-involved. I would have preferred if she had somehow got her "come-up" and somehow was punished because I just didn't like her.
