A lot of good things could have been done with this movie by using virtually the same set, plot units and storyline. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's ability before the murder of her lover? Why not develop Erica and the cop's relationship slowly and convincingly? Perhaps contrast of Eric's metamorphics by including some other post-event facets, relationships, etc. In her life, which she now rejects? Why not get her hurting an innocent bystander to emphasize the inaccuracy of Eric's actions. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO utilizes revenge fantasy to its maximum level, giving inappropriate lip service to "not doing it at home" Messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Jodie Foster fan. After showing a selection of films such as LAMBS LYM, NELL and one where she plays a regular mother of a childhood, Foster has embarked on a series of roles where she plays the same hard-bitten, killed heroine who overcomes evil at all. This is fine once or twice, but I get too used to her "fight against aircraft" close-up. TBO could have used a younger actress or one who more convincingly embraced being a woman in her 40s (instead of 40 something Foster playing a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a movie with big players, funding and resources that manage to get down to junk.
