It's the kind of movie that BEGS is being shown on TV in 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly the filmmakers responsible for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" they made a relevant statement on women and philandering and the dangers of the demon room, all wrapped in a sci-fi allegorium. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax write-off. <br /> <br /> Whatever it turns out, "Attack" is best for the viewer under the following circumstances: a) extreme poisoning, b) watched a double bill with any of these Jacqueline Suzanne movies (maybe "One time is not enough "?) or c) Just one night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you will feel great, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special FX and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in the Washington D.C. - It's just the memorable one. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she will love you for it.
