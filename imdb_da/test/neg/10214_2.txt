A new wrestling show paves the way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell is making every effort to pull the WWF champion Rip into the quadratic circle to head out to Zeus for the "The Tough Guys Battle" championship. But Zeus is unlike any competitor that Rip has ever had. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan some leeway like a wrestler who crossed over to a movie role, but this movie didn't ask Hulkster to do much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed miserably. 'Tiny' lists made a good effort as the mighty Zeus, but even his work left the film missing something, namely to act! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you like, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you'll probably have to turn off just over ten minutes in.
