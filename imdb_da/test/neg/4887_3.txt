I bought this for a few dollars in the local video store as they clear their ties for DVDs. I doubt they will replace this in one way or another. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scenes. Me Me Lai is not naked enough on time (only about 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I had expected either. So two of my reasons for seeing this movie were knocked out. <br /> <br /> There is some serious animal violence here for those who enjoy such things. A big fight between a mongoose and a big snake becomes quite bloody. Animal torture, some of which are genuine and some fake. Fortunately, the fake is a little fun, but the real one is just a little sick. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a 70's movie - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have been. But that's something else, right? One and a half stars!
