I was looking forward to watching this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to my daughters advice. This should have been a spoof, but it took a realism that companies had a lot to answer. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey after all the work he has done is still Jim Carrey, and his comedy doesn't get any better, his co-star was unable to back him up. Their son in the movie was invisible. Crime life was a blink, and that was the missing link in the movie. The movie showed 2 or 3 robberies, and they were richer than before, where it lost to me. <br /> <br /> I was laughing at some parts, but not enough at all, AlecBaldwin felt I was there to add some weight to the movie. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many holes to make this a smart and tight movie.
