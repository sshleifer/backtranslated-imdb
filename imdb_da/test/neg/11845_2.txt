The biggest and most disturbing thing in the Raptor movie ended because Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur, unless the child in the loader was a little better acted and acted then the adult. The similarities with the Carnosaur films were rather poor choices in the plot line. The only thing that approached well was the beginning with the children in the jeep. Then the plot went down the hill from there. Would have been nice if another plot had been conceived, rather than cloning the previous movies. The raptor film should have taken lessons from the Jurasic Park series in different plots. The only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie is Aztec Rex. The repeated scenes taken from the Carnosaur films leave a person thinking of these films.
