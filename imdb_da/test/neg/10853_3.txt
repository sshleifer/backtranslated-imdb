A very bad movie, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. A few examples: At an early stage, Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; Instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they move forward in open land to fight them, as opposed to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the key characters, is apparently the daughter of a white Russian and obsessed with her Russian, but she does not speak Russian; a guilty German air force is attacking an anti-aircraft gun - however, the gun does not burn shrapnel shells, but gives a direct hit on its plane, which does not resemble a German WWII plane. In fairness, when they could escape the prehistoric plot and the resulting absurdities, there are some really powerful moments. The prospect of people slowly starving to death is convincingly made and moving, but these show only the rest of it even more. A movie to be avoided.
