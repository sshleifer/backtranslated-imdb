There are none - no redeeming qualities for this movie. They didn't check a single fact - NOT one at all ... anything. I'm sorry Larry Miller and even more sadly his agent for not being more able to find him a more appropriate place. The adults are all idiotic. The effects are cheeses and devoid of any sense of reality. The music is honestly cheesy. The reason is without faith. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with your family, see something else. Take some time and look for mildew in the ceiling. My ten year mocking this movie, as we see it. Unfortunately, he learns that not all movies are worth seeing.
