I had no idea what this movie was about, jumping from plot line to plot line linking unholy coherent ideas to each other. It just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The chopped timeline doesn't help either. We are starting today to get a flash back to the past and then return to the future to just go back to the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is also full of horrible sappy lines and cliché themes like princess and pauper, "you can't have myself in my death" lines, "you don't love me enough" line. cliché to the maximum! <br /> <br /> the battle situation was horribly corny, the light was constantly being misplaced, which compensated CG with the actors (waving you could tell some of the backgrounds was clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the community in the moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I don't really recommend him to anyone, avoid if possible. <br /> <br /> If you found this comment difficult to follow, the movie would be just as bad.
