Why are the forces that continue to throw Jennifer Lopez in incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena, and quite good in Money Train, both of whom cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. But roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (look out for the incredible achievement), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist who is involved in virtual reality experiments where she enters her patients to help them solve their problems. When she enters a comatose serial killer to save one of her victims, she breaks all the rules to try to break the madness of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's plays here are typically below average. I can't get over the loud sound of a voice she has. She is no Julia Roberts, yet she comes on the screen as if she thinks she is in the same room. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she's a very sexy lady; However, it does not come to bear a movie, and it certainly does not bear this. With someone else throwing in his role for this movie, it would have been excellent, especially if it was thrown with someone who could give more credibility to the character. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie is visually stunning. The colors are amazing and the story is not half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The sound here is also fantastic. This movie wins some points for the rather original story, and great points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, it gives play and the poor casting a few notches. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
