This movie was a big disappointment. The plot sounded good about a half-human half-leopard being in Africa, which is the subject of a documentary film by young American adults. When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are in doubt. I wouldn't even call this a horror movie, as most of the movie is actually about the aforementioned narcissistic 20-somethings (mis) adventures that include sex and wildlife to be loud (aren't as entertaining as it sounds - believe me ). You rarely come to see the creature, and the main actor (who also happens to be director, screenwriter, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I was finally so annoyed by the never-ending dialogue that I quickly forwarded to the end. I had guessed the end in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was right. Thus, this horrible film is also quite predictable - as if it wasn't bad enough. Moral of the story: Avoid movies that are traded, managed, edited, produced and written by the same no one. And avoid this movie unless it is held at gunpoint.
