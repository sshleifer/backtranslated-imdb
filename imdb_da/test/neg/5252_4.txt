The future of imagination never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert will fight the evil demon Grendel in this grim look trashy fantasy epic. "Epos" did I say? Is ... there is only one place, so you can't really call it an epic adventure, can you? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5 inch tall castle, so how did all the actors succeed? Oh, I get it, those that have special effects. A miniature. Silly me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons why you might or would NOT see this movie picture: <br /> <br /> - Lambert gets his sword-swinging tricks again as he did in Highlander. - The sets and costumes are incredibly cool (if you are a 12 year old). - Rhona Mitra has a successful pair of knockers that she likes to show off throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> - ... there, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> - every time they start fighting over-the-top raving techno soundtracks. So why fight these medieval slayer dudes while they are dancing. - They don't have electricity in this slot, but they have speakers installed that seem to work fine. So where is the amplifier? I suppose they borrowed it from techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Watch it for climax in the end, featuring a monstrous demonoid CGI creature coming straight out of a Playstation 2 survival horror game. <br /> <br /> If all this got you interested, take it (at your own risk) but don't tell anyone I told you. I suppose Pinhead visits the set while shooting because this movie has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin, then see Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
