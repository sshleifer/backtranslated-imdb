This film is a perfect example of the fact that a movie cannot succeed with a large budget alone. It is obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated to this: the animation is fluid, detailed and amazing - the soundtrack is not too memorable except for the final song by Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). The musical score is heavily full orchestral material. Kudos to the animators and music composers! 10.9. But the story and the characters fall flat. It feels very 'been there, done it', predictably and simply uninteresting. The characters have different personalities, but nothing to suffer. They annoyed me to no end. I tried really hard to like this, but I didn't care about the story - it was cliché action-adventure plot. There were "jokes" that weren't fun. It was vomiting provoking predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and awful - especially the last line "It's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember cringing. I wish it would hurry and finish. Nor was I the only one, the people I went with, thought it was boring. Please see Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra movies if you want to see anyone. This was a waste of time.
