It is proof that filmmakers and their financiers treat their audience with contempt are not new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s, and HOUSE OF Dracula is a good example. You would seem to have a movie with Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster, which the producer would dictate to the scriptwriter to get all three to come in a scene. They had a chance with the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN when they had another bite of the cherries, they jumped again with HOUSE OF Dracula. Losing a chance is an accident, losing two bites of cynical money making <br /> <br /> Obviously, manufacturers are careless. Larry Talbot reappears even though he was shown to die in the previous film that summarizes the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows what a bad manuscript is, and we are mistreated with some horrible plots that Talbot's condition is cured by a particular type of plant that will soften his skull. I think scriptwriter Edward T Lowe could have gotten his skull softened if that's the kind of thing he comes up with. <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton cannot improve the script and throw in a few keys of his own. For example, Talbot is scared to see Dr Edelmann snatching a lift on a wagon but nonchalantly seeing Edelmann climbing a wall and jumping into the castle courtyard. One cannot help but think Talbot's reaction shot was mistakenly changed during the editing phase. Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies, but did not have much career outside them. Perhaps it is enough that he is not a good actor, and here he commits himself to the worst kind of play - there is a lot of wood. It is not quite his fault, but because all the characters are touching a bit of terrible dialogue and are all a bit of wood because of Kenton's lack of instruction. <br /> <br /> HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles away from the James Whale 1931 movie and its successor from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to finish. But ironically, Universal decided to make a movie to unpack their franchise with a horror comedy with Abbot and Costello
