This movie was meaningless. I can't even call it sci-fi, as it takes more from a movie than just to take place in space. "Max Q" is not even indicated in the space for the entire movie. The story / plot is unoriginal, the casting is nothing to write home about, although it would be odd with a topcast in a mediocre movie ... Besides, it is not very exciting or well-written. At least it is evenly balanced in a low quality kind of way, as nothing or no one stands out. Everything is just as boring. I usually find a quality in "room flicks", even though it's only 90 minutes of half-entertainment bordering on low-budget pathetic, but "Max Q" didn't even give me satisfaction. All in all, a complete waste of time.
