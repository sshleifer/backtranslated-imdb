I would really love this movie. I have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is wonderful. This film is very far from the book. The book is amazing - this movie is a horrible adaptation. In the book, Sara is honest, kind and strong, and never makes any sense to come back to anyone. It's the book's point! She behaves like "princes" regardless of the circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is not to return uninhibited. It must behave honorably, no matter how you are treated. <br /> <br /> In the book, she spends a lot and touches on the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after they have seen their kindness and ability to endure without sinking and revenge. Sara does what is right just because it's right. <br /> <br /> Outside of the bakery, she comes to a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is very hungry. She gives a bowl to this wild-looking little girl leaning on the bakery doorstep. When she sees how fierce the spike is and looks at her gobble pile, she gives her another. She continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4, I think - I can't remember how many. The bakers look through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed, she enters the beggar's girl and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are also affected by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in her book, her father died. The man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. Her father did not lose her money at all - the man is excited to find Sara; He takes her and Becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. And of course Sara has her full legacy. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she stays in the same position at school. But she is humiliated when Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara speaks to Miss Minchin in the end - Miss Minchin tries to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm, steadfast behavior, instructs Miss Minchin that she has been cruel. <br /> <br /> There is no comeuppance for Miss Minchin. She continues in her miserable existence. It doesn't matter - it is important that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dear friend in the world, Becky, is now for all purposes, her sister. <br /> <br /> The book is about love and honest behavior in the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It's a wonderful book. This movie does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife loved it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to keep it out. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I can't think of the reason why the movie film should change this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the horrible manuscript from the book that Shirley Temple acted on. I do not know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values ​​that I do not recognize it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a father!
