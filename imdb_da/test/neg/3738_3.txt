Celebrity singers have always had a hard time breaking into the movies (the cinema is full of unsuccessful attempts) and one can continue to wonder why John Mellencamp never made it big as an actor. Instead of taking small parts in intense projects, Mellencamp appears to be playing the lead in "Falling From Grace", which he also instructed, and the result is so awkward and carefree as the title. History of a famous singer who returns to her hometown in the pegs opens old family seasons, has a manuscript by Larry McMurtry, but the winding movie goes nowhere slowly. The support aids are decent, including Kay Lenz (which is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the really strong scene in the picture). As for John's performance, he does not look very comfortable despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; He seems to ducking the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an instant. * 1/2 from ****
