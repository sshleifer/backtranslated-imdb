EXPERT, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Dull, characters, boring situations, boring direction, boring actors, boring filmography, boring music. <br /> <br /> I don't really understand this movie. Should it be an action movie? It's almost like Speakman would be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in EXPERT is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical "Speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there, but the movie's main aspect relies on some kind of trustworthy drama that is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with action stars. In the end, this confused movie looks and feels very unnoticed and gentle. The worst aspect of EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply does not belong in this kind of (boring) movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very boring product on their hands, and they asked the composer to make the movie feel more convincing and dramatic with its score, making the whole movie look even more confused, more capable and boring. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this, even if you are a Jeff Speakman fan.
