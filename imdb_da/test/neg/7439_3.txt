A meaningless cash-in with nothing to contribute except nastiness, this is a concrete case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's numbing, plot less and tired mess of a sequel is reliable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious, uncomfortable trashy way, but it has almost none of original flair, emotion, intelligence or excitement. Instead, we just have another empty play of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be nauseating the viewer with ruthless violence, which is far more brainless gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which made the original Robocop cyborg, has become more totalitarian than ever before, what about the suspicious Nazi banners, storm troop watches and end-of-life tanks; as for the anonymous old man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less of a benevolent patron and more of a hefty Mr. Burns type, which surrounds itself with moronic lackeys, who really believe in putting the brain into a murderous psychopath into the body of brand new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop gets a look into somewhere in the middle of all this mess, even if you wonder what on Earth a fine actor like Peter Weller saw in the script. Drollen Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while Nancy Allen is poorly wasted as Robocop's partner. There are some hilarious moments throughout; The opening 'Magnavolt' commercial, for example, but it is a poor follow-up on the really big original.
