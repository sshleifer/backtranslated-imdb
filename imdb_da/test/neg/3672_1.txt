If you enjoy sitting in the dark, both literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then it's the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Waste of actors, resources and audience time. Ultimately a waste of space. Don't be tempted by the resumption. There is no substance other than that. The movie lacks all the basic things you can expect from the genre; plot, character, development, degradation. The caste may have to take the heart out of the knowledge that their efforts in this case will be completely forgettable and, if so, their career might be improved. Absolute tripe.
