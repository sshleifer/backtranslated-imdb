RKO attempted to increase its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strongly willing to have a doctor (JOHN BEAL) accept to run away from the responsibility of this little programmer. TCM aired it as a step in Joan Fontaine's career. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is serious and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has a young James Garner's look and cocky manners) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine. What happened to this beautiful actress? Why has RKO not promoted him, along with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian. <br /> <br /> These are the kind of thoughts that went through my head when I saw this somewhat lukewarm drama that never fully fulfilled the strong promise of its title. The story itself is rather tiring, which only occasionally comes to life because of Fontaina's spiritual heroine. She photographs beautifully as a nurse and skillfully carries her serious expression and suggests that there was more to be drained in a future date. Beal never went on to a prominent career and his performance shows why. Strictly missing. <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Huston? Evidence here is that he should have had a worthy movie career. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: Watch for Dwight Frye (by "Dracula") as out of control the patient aboard the aircraft.
