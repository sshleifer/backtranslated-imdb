A large number of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's holiday. The stories blend together, characters fight, make friends, cheat each other, have sex ... Blanc has collected a star cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but for some benefit. What needs to be fun is instead of boring boring and annoying. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and finally, despite the dangerous nature of the dangers, this viewer was left somewhat of what is happening to any of them. <br /> <br /> Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard, but that's it. And Dutronc looks like he's a little exaggerated pinch and tucks if you ask me ...
