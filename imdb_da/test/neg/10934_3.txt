The only reason I saw this because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare and Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, All talented players and have provided good performances in the past. NOT THIS TIME ,, A weak serial killer story, you can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Very constructed in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 weak
