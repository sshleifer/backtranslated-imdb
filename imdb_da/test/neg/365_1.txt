I say "flick" because this does not deserve the "movie" appellation, and certainly not "movie". I am sorry to pay for the rent and although I have never been on a movie before, it would have been, had I seen it in a theater. A society that lives underground in the future (oooh, it's original), lots of burning barrel drums, inexplicable ambient light shining through windows, an ungrateful woman, and her cushioned son ... the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell influences the stereotypical loner's husky voice you know as Eastwood has been made to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, but in flashbacks he is the same age! Talk about a bad memory! I stared incredibly as the little boy Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens! No excitement, pithy religious (what religion?) Under / overtones ... make sure everyone: I expected better from Roddy Piper; Probably the worst movie experience in my life.
