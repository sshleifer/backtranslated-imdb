This movie was very disappointing and, with the exception of a few moments, it didn't fly at all. More than anything, it was just flippin 'stupid. The music was frickin 'bad and the plot played out like a BYU bowl game ?? very predictable (avoids the embarrassment of scoring, a late game illustration of touchdowns, a rally that goes short and leads to losses). Essentially, the half-born Will (the movie's fetishes) and his religiously confused brother Danny (we just call him a democrat), treat Kirby (the movie's "Sweet Spirit"), 3rd member of their rude Mormon "boy band", who crap until the film's husband and grandfather (Jill) has a talk with Will and corrects him. Credible Will's personality changes 180 degrees, and he is immediately the mature and self-conscious leader of the band. This would be a cute, maybe fun, 10-minute road show concert, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life of you if you see it at the end. My advice? take the money you normally spend to rent this show and burn it in your fireplace or rinse it down on the toilet ?? more entertainment with much less commitment. If you want to see a better movie of the same genre, do you get Saints and soldiers ?? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (in fact, Kirby has more fun things in sacred than he does in SOP).
