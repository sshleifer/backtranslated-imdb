You will probably be very disappointed with this successor, who is not a successor. AWIL is a classic. But this movie is about so far from being a classic you can get. what a joke. special effects that are not particularly special, horrible dialogue, non acting.and a ridiculously ridiculous subplot fast and invincible (not to mention fleeting) tacked with about a third of the movie left.did i mention the story is less than lame.there is No way this should be serious horror movie, but it is too stupid to be fun in any good way. The rating it currently has (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me.my assessment of a US werewolf in Paris: a 3.5 / 10
