I just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say I didn't enjoy it a bit. It's so slow Slow and uninteresting. This kid from Harry Potter plays a shy teen with a rude mother, and someday the rude mother tells the child to find a job so they could accommodate an old boy apparently having somewhere to live has begun living with his family and therefore the child goes to work for an old lady. And this old lady who lives all alone teaches him about girls, car and life! I couldn't see how an 18 year old guy enjoys spending time with a horrible lady in the 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie have bothered people who may have had it, I could be wrong as I am not British and cannot understand the social and family structure and way of living. For the most part, the film is made for the British audience.
