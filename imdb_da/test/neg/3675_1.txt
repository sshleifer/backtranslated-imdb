It seems that there is great potential for the film's storyline to be something worth looking at. The action was flat, and the story lacked depth. There was too much dependence on camera work, which had some high points. I agree with the other negative comments. I just wish I had read them before I bought the DVD. The movie may be worth watching for free and you get bored of tears before hand. There could have been much more plot development with why there is homeless in Moscow (ie post-Soviet "capitalism", heavy use of drugs (ie increased heroin trade from Afghanistan); more development of why the revival of Russian orthodoxy after autumn The Soviet Union, the archaeologists themselves, or even more in the fight against nihilism.
