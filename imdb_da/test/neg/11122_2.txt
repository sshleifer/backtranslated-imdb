Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out ... and they seem to get worse every time. When usually good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come out as rank amateurs, imagine how scary the rest of the throw in this waste of your time is. The only half-decent thing is the creature's rubber equipment (which is flashing in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how false it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term solved) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal for that. See a re-run of "The Munsters" for the 372 view - your time would be better spent (and very scary too)!
