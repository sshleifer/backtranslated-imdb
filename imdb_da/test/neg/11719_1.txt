No one does, no blood, no joyful death scenes ... stupid stupid stupid stupid. Dear God, sitting through this movie made me sick. Sick sick sick. Very boring ... extremely boring ... There's not even a humorous aspect to this movie! I can't find a good thing to say about it, except the leading guy had a good body ... I guess. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
