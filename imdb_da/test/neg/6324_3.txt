Okay, where to start. I can't believe how many good reviews I read here. I saw this (in 2004) and I had to fight not to hit the stop button, I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read. Having seen it, I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. First and foremost, the film looks like it will never begin. The plot line does not take place until approx. 30 minutes before the film ends, leaving the viewer to question when should it begin. So never call this a "revenge movie" because revenge doesn't even begin until over half of the movie has gone. In addition, the film tries to make you think this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I'm sorry to show dusty country roads half of the movie and a crooked letter on a sign, didn't quite convince me, even for 1979 it wasn't science fiction. So still add this to randomly placed homoerotic subtitles and you've got yourself a crappy movie (I have nothing against gay, it just wasn't necessary). The only good part was the first hunting scene, good bill considering it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills the last guy. So basically I recommend you to see the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you put yourself through all the things in the middle, which can lead you to push your own eyes out . Don't say I didn't warn you.
