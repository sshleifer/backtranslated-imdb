I actually liked some things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had the choice in the first three games. There is nothing like seeing the monsters close by, in your face. The graphics were really not bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with, even though it was just a shooting game. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I also thought the weapons sucked. This game is fun for a while, but it's not like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot things. I'd recommend it to the news of playing in the first person, but it's about it. Play it at your own risk.
