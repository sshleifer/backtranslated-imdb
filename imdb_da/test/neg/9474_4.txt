Let me first get this from my breast I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately after the opening sequence everything goes downhill. First, there was absolutely no reason to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his corny jokes. Next, there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan cringe, for example the sequence in which Bond turns out to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown. The bad guys are pretty bad, Louis Jordon fails to make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as bad as his artisan. It's fun that when people debate what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy is overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money.
