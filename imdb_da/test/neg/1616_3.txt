I bought this movie from e-bay as part of a lot of about 20 horror flicks, all about a dollar a piece. When I looked at this, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 80s. Later I began to think - Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to suggest that I was dealing with a newer movie. To realize that the girl became an unbearable plague. The last 3 minutes were the longest in film history - the movie just refused to finish. Is there a genre like "horror for children"? In that case, this movie is determined by it. If there are parents who are horrible enough to introduce their offspring to horror, I suggest this would be perfect for children of about 6-8. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was too good for an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom of a purchase double bill.
