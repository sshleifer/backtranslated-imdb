Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin English should be the worst of all Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on par with any 4-year primary school drama class. I've seen used car dealers in TV commercials that can work better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the boring Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids, but Wow! The baseline seemed OK, but the director should have demanded more from his actors. I realize that the Weissmuller movies have a few mistakes, but this seemed to be so "low budget".
