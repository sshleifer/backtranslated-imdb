I am a huge Amy Adams fan and have been for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. That being said, it's not a good movie at any level. It's pretty boring, and the acting manager is very very poor. Amy Adams is awkward to look at action with Scott G. Anderson because she is in another league when it comes to acting. All performances come out as very amateur. The music performances are pleasant, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was put in this movie because he has a good voice, but that's just not the case. He has an average voice and sings the key, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> I think I can see why Amy Adams made this movie with the song element, I just wanted her not to. I could rant about other poor items in this movie, but I will leave it at that.
