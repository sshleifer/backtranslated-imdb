Another B movie for teenagers based mainly on CGI effects, industrial soundtracks and some medieval images. It is a pitty that the legend of Beowulf is used in such uninspired manner. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit that he's getting worse as an actor and his movie too. Rent it if you are only a teenager.
