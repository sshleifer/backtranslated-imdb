35 years after this, Castro still reigns. Unfortunately, we are scraping back our heads and wondering how the dim lunatic played by stage-chewing Jack Palance did so far as in 1960. I stumbled upon this recently and was amused by noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and "B" movie favorite Paul (Untouchables) Picnic among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he instructed this stupidity. Some of the lines are classic in a "Did he really say that kind of way?" The other thing I have just noticed is that the score and sound (NOT the dialogue) are actually excellent - the only first-class elements in the whole production. So do not look at this to learn about history or acting, but if you want to see this as a goof, bring the beer and have fun.
