I saw this in a preview screen and have to say that this documentary is the biggest load of tripe I've ever seen. Completely unfunny, low budget, boring, garbage script, horrible play - The whole audience (young and old) sat through the movie komatose without laughing for the most part ... there were literally only about 2 places you want to laugh throughout the movie < br /> <br /> Many people went halfway - can't blame them ... I kept thinking that the movie would pick up, but it never did, and I wish I would leave. <br /> <br /> The humor was really lame and I am surprised that it has ever made it to the big screen. I'm not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all - it was just not fun. The people who made this movie really do not deserve your money, so please pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even fun enough to be shown on TV, let alone a movie theater. .. <br /> <br /> I would give it 0 out of 10, but the system doesn't allow it ...
