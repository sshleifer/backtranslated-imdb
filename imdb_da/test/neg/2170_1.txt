When I voted, I should give a 2, but when I saw that 1 meant terrible, it hit the nail upside down. The depiction of native Americans as bloodthirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me. This is the third movie I've seen of D.w. griffiths where men's races are stereotypical in ugly ways. The man can't tell his side of the story so I will try to keep away from attacking Mr. Griffith personally. In my opinion, the three films have probably influenced thinking of millions of people and their children's children. Films like this probably made for many of the anger that is still with us. Some may say the camera's work was amazing, the action is first for that time. The positives are far offset by the negatives, it's like someone takes $ 10 from you and gives a dime back to make up for it.
