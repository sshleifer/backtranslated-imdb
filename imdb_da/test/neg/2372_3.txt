This is a comedy version of "Strangers on a Train". It seems pretty good. I am a tough degree, so 3 rating reflects mainly on characters and plot. The performances are extremely good, everyone. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine the most. Every performer seems good enough to play. The comedy works on a level just as little as slapstick. DeVito characters work best when they are depressed. His character, portrayed as a notch, would probably be more real if he was published and proud as much as most hackers are. His character would actually have a great agent and more inquiries. The characters are one-dimensional, which is okay in comedy. But the character of the crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill "moma" suddenly gives no meaning at all. It looks like a miserable attempt at humor. The pitiful trials are not too often, and the film flows pretty well.
