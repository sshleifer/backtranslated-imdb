Please - if you have not tried to sit through this waste and are considering seeing this flick / mini series - do yourself a favor and find something else to do. Floss your teeth, start learning how to play the cello, beat your dog - whatever you choose will be time better spent than seeing this junk. This is not a bad movie that you can get a couple of chuckles out of - it just sucks in every possible way. Just boring from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> And for those pet lovers out there, the feeling that my comment above is insensitive - if your dog could speak, he or she would ask to beat, rather than suffer, looking at this mess .
