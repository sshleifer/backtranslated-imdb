Peter Hunt started as a very talented movie editor and got his first staff to control as he helled the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (considered by many Bond fans as the best of the series). Other titles in his filmography include epic-scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil", both adapted to Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is a weird one on his movie list; It seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and expertise chooses to lead a film of this kind. A half-live action / half-animated tale of Jonathan Swift's classic satire, the movie then twenty years out of date, even when made, and in honesty it simply doesn't work. And it's not a terrible thing that Hunt (with his usual eye for quick actions) or the star Richard Harris (who can usually experience the most styled roles) can do to save this. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in the 17th century Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to travel to London to make his happiness; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving a little less pay, but a lot more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called 'the antelope. During a journey, "Antelope" is blown naturally during a storm and hits a reef. The ship sinks and everyone is lost, except Gulliver ??. who finds himself washed ashore in Lilliput Kingdom. When he comes around, Gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small people, no higher than his toe. For them, he looks like a giant. They persuade Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of small people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver doesn't like being manipulated for war and destruction, so he plans to escape. <br /> <br /> Harris is back to wearing the whole movie here. His first couple of scenes involve other actors, but when he is broken in Lilliput, he uses the rest of the film, which stretches over knee-high sets and acts with his animated colleagues. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at that time, but it had certainly not been done much. A couple of Disney movies such as Song Of The South, so loved my heart and Pete's dragon had tamed the idea, but it was still pretty in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly well-animated movie, but the scenes showing the interaction between Harris and his comic-co-stars are at least competently done. Occasionally, the film tries to be true to its satirical origin (there is a scene where we learn that Lilliput has gone to war with his neighbor because of eggs!? - and the meaning seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things). But in his heart it is very much a children's film, and the satirical overtones are hardly inhabited. Everyone involved has done better things during their career ?? "Gulliver's Travels" can fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but apart from that, it's a forgettable and underwhelming experience.
