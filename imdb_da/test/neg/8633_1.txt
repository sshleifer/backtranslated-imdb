* spoiler alert! * it just gets to me the nerve some people need to restore (and i use the term loosely here ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original end was not pasteurized enough for the American audience. So what do they do? they create a new one! a stupid, unlikely, in-charge-i-dead-but-to-life-again-then-the-good-guy-can-kick-my-butt-something more kind of ending. Do yourself a favor and get the original one.
