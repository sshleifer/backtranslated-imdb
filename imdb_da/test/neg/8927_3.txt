Bad action movies are the cemetery for aging martial arts stars. In such films, they struggle to maintain the dangerous behavior that made their early work successful, but they all fail. Seagal is too old for this type of role, but he won't let go ... no matter how stupid he looks. Some hope his present work somehow will bring back the magic, but there is no magic left. The late 80s and early 90s belonged to Steven Seagal, and his work made me a fan. I could see him fit nicely in a castle at The Sopranos, where his overweight body, jowly features and sullen attitude could have found a home. I wonder what the return is on his run of direct to video? Since he produces them, I suppose $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the deal, we will face badly executed Seagal action movies well in his late 60s and 70s .....
