I thought this movie had an interesting name and could just have been thoughtful, but I was wrong. This movie was boring, especially at the beginning and middle. I can't comment on the end because I just couldn't watch the whole movie. The principle of signing a student researcher just because he enters your laboratory makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and unfortunately this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you have problems with sleep then I recommend renting this movie.
