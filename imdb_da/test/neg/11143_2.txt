Like Flesh and looking forward to the Heat, but could not help feeling Morrissey grossly exploited most of the "performers" featured here. Stumbling naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all that Dallesandro was capable of in this function - a big and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he can perform; Most things look like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation okay - she is performing the Lower East Side. But her is a woman's show - she rarely enters the other artists, although it must be said that her sex scene with a beer bottle certainly leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic plays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young, wild lover, it is with a vampire's sharpness. Two of the female artists, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices that you will have to subdue the sound of getting through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after they only add air to exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get ahead of Morrissey's camera anyway. There is probably not a worse way to spend a Saturday night, but at least it brings a certain time and place to life.
