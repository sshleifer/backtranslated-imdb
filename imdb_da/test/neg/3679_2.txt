While in Madrid, I was able to see a screener copy of this movie. Wow! Gallo is amazing in it. Very unusual performance he gives. However, apart from Gallo's genius, the movie is a boring movie I've ever seen in my life, and sometimes it's so badly made to laugh at ridiculously. I'm also a Val Kilmer fan, so he was part of the reason I made such a big effort to watch the movie. The problem is Val is really only in one scene. Having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast. I have only seen Stranded by the directors other films. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you are as much as a Gallo fan, then I see this movie no matter how bad it is. If you don't like Gallo then there is ZERO left to love.
