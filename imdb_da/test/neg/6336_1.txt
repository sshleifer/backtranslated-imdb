This movie has to be one of the all-time lows of Michael J. Fox's generally respectable career. I should have known how horrible this movie was when I rented it and found the movie only half seen and not rewound by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult child star, now an agent of other show business kids. His character is misleading because he still thinks everyone should love him to be Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all sympathetic. In fact, the only sympathetic character in the entire movie is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn accent receptionist for the agency. One of the movies that makes me keep a post-it note to the box warns others not to waste their time!
