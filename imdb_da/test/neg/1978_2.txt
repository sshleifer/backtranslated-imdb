Beautiful pictures and many games do not make a good movie. And that's exactly what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me admit I am not yet playing FFVII (I intend to book it soon). But I did research to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. But not everyone has time to investigate things like this, and Advent Children requires that knowledge of FFVII is required. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible pictures, I can't say there is too much new. We've seen it in Final Fantasy: The guts inside, and apart from a better movement, I can't say they've done lots of super-bold things with this. Battle Scenes - Well, they're a little funny. How can we ever doubt the outcome of any of them. This one was boringly classic - there were three games with the wicked, after the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, being smashed, then he almost comes and gets smashed and finally wins). The reason I say it was boring classic was that it was used a lot, but in this case is poorly executed. I'll think about it later. <br /> <br /> The English dub seemed to be fine for me, even though I didn't see it in Japanese, so I don't want to judge the Japanese dub, but only the English. I want to say this - I've heard many better, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> Now, the plot. Ummm ... what plot? Let me be honest, this movie is nothing but a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with lovely eye lights. As I said earlier, the matches just seem to happen for no reason. The opening game is never explained, Kadaj does not seem to have ambitions to destroy the world itself or any real motivation to do something ugly. Cloud sits around moping for the whole movie, and virtually everyone else gets a mandatory cameo. <br /> <br /> FFVII was really an ensemble piece. Advent Children is anything but. If they had managed to give everyone a significant historical role (Star Trek: First contact turned out to be possible I could add) then it could have been much better. It would of course also have changed the plot, which, let's be honest, is almost set to be better than what we got. Characters were also generally unused or almost forgotten. The members of the avalanche (ie the Cloud group worked with in FFVII, for those who do not know), get 2 scenes (3 for Vincent Valentine, and some become even smaller). Hell, the bad ones get more lines than these guys, and that's pretty bad. The music ... I don't care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he smashed this movie big time. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he couldn't decide to be epic (and orchestra) or fun (with electric guitar). When he switched from one to another, you felt as if he had taken a sledgehammer in his head. <br /> <br /> And the last point about whether this movie was epic or fun ... it was trying to be both and fail miserably. Honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. The film also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three are too much), but also succeeded here. The last scene reminiscent of a baptism ceremony was thrown in there for what is similar to that. You don't have to be a Christian to just shake your head and cry there. This scene did not belong to the movie (nor to Aerith's frequent appearance - she's dead Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how amazing I have heard Final Fantasy VII being, this movie is no shortage of gigantic disappointment. Because of the beautiful visuals, I give it a 2 out of 10.
