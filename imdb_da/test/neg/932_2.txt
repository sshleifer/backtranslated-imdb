It's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through. <br /> <br /> Now let me go on record by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. From fun and stupid to those who focus on martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic types? It's a genre that I really enjoy. Movies like "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "A Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; and other. That's why I was looking forward to "A Chinese Great Story". One of the film's characters is "Monkey King" (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology, first told in the story of "Journey to the West", the epic adventure written 500 years ago. (Monkey King and his disciples' history is also the focus of the "Chinese odyssey" films among many others). Other well-known characters shown in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So how is it wrong? Well, let's take an example known to Western audiences. What about Robin Hood mythology? A well-known story from your old days. Let's say that our Robin Hood movie star Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood, and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's also give Sir Robin a Uzi because you never know when to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They may also need rocket packs, and while we are on it, they provide a tactical nuclear weapon because it could be useful. If you think it sounds like a really beautiful story by the Robin Hood story, then "A Chinese Tall Story" is the movie for you! As I stated above, this movie is a shaken mess. In the first 30 minutes, not only Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing are introduced, but also the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium-bug demon" (who shoots laser beams), an underground wooden door , a noble imp tribe, an English girl in an intergalactic egg, Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, an everlasting morphing magical golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, space snake holes, and four heavenly knights. All this would not be too bad - the narratives and myths descended over the years certainly have all sorts of amazing elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not contain many of the things we get subjected to in the last half of the movie. (Useful advice for filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys can come up with cold-looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war does not mean they should). You know that your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the instructor asks (and I'm not doing it? It's a direct quote from the comment) "I asked the composer if we can get a more rock-and-roll type of music, When she transforms into a kind of android-like thing. "Is there a story hidden here somewhere? Yes. Yes there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse? "Gen-X Cops", "Time and Tide", "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the lizard girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing in this movie. You can know her as half of the Canto pop group "Twins" and from other movies like "The Twins Effect" (a fun flick) and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, who is a lizard imp and all, is hardly recognizable by his warts, snagged out teeth, lovely nose and hunched back. It is until the computers get hold of and beautify her, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is acceptable, but all the supporting actors were unpleasant. A few recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted. <br /> <br /> At one point I discussed with myself if "A Chinese Tall Story" was a spoof. I could almost convince myself that it was when the intergalactic maid (played by a very nice Fan Bing-Bing) came out and lit a Marlboro (!) While talking to Tripitaka, who practiced martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume (!!). But it's not a spoof. Of course, there is the typical Hong Kong silliness, but the film takes it seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with sledge hammering of violins and evocative cellos) and exciting action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You may think you could see this on a Netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (Oh, but it costs you, okay). Is there anything good to say? Of course. The colors are alive (they are the best of this movie). And the filmmakers certainly tried very hard. Too bad everything went for a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.
