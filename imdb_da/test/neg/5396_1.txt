SKELETON MAN was okay for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "Special Force Agents" hit the screen, it went down the hill faster than a fat child on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening makes us think we might have a corny, but fun, horror flick on our hands, but no ... the filmmakers are destroying any hope of it when "Special Force Agents" appear . I want the scriptwriter to take another route and chase the "Skeleton Man" down some obscure teens until one of them finally gets the upper hand. Instead, "Skeleton Man" fights down some obscure "Special Force Agents" and knocks them off until their captain finally gets over. <br /> <br /> I know the whole "stalking of killed teens of a killer" thing that has been done before, but it would have been more suitable for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> When "Skeleton Man" finally fulfills his "so-called" death in a building jumping up, the Captain of "Special Force Agents" is asked by a police officer outside the building: "What happened in there ? " My answer to this question: "Who heals cares?"
