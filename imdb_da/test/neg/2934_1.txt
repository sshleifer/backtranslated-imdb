I & Out made me want to throw up. I have never seen such a shameless movie! It wanted seriously to be gay, is something wonderful and pleasing, but has no idea how to say it. For me it was not a comedy unless cruel, funny jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it. From what I saw, this movie had four (4) big bugs starting with (A) Matt Dillion's character as he announces to the world former teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. Never mind how incredible it is that Matt Dillion's character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why would he say something like that? After all, it was never a problem with Howard's students, his friends, family, or his beauty. None. So why would he say something like it wasn't true? More to the point, why does the film not give us an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is no answer, and for the convenience of the plot there is no one. The second (B) error is that the movie seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relationship of members of the same sex. In this movie, gays are based on suffering Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these failures are met again at the must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out what's going on in the small town and the movie seems to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he comes to the ceremony, he says nothing and I wondered why in the world he came at all. He didn't solve anything. So when the entire audience was announcing that they were gay, I was so moved that I would vomit! These people stood up to defend Howard as gay by mocking all those stereotypes. What the movie forgot is that it used stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. The movie players shot themselves in the foot! But wait there more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (Howard) seemed to be trying to lose jobs as a teacher because people believed he would influence his students to be gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit and that he would not influence his students. But did we not see Tom Selleck's character endlessly imprinting Howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, coming out of the closet when I in my eye didn't have a closet to get out of? Thus, the film clearly shows that homosexuals are able to recruit. The film again shoots itself in the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard got out of the closet, did anyone notice how the script closed him for the rest of the movie? I figured only three lines he had afterwards: "Yup!" to his parents, "Hey there!" to a student, and "Are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last throwing scene. I can be low for one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide that he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head because I never thought he was gay. <br /> <br /> As bonuses, the film also features several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard asks a pastor for advice on what to do for a friend (he) who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. "Does it make him gay?" he asks. The pastor responded "Oh yes, he is certainly gay". Uh huh. Or how about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered to tell Howard's mother that she doesn't have to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret, because well ... everyone has them. Then one of the ladies confessed that she had never seen "Bridges of Madison County". Fun? None! If the movie is shown to be insensitive and has no idea how devastating it may be for the family to have one of its members announced that he / she is gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay and none of their families are doing well at all. It was a bad way to diffuse the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw for me was the last scene that gave them the look that Tom and Kevin got married. The camera ran very slowly to the front of the church when ... It wasn't what you thought! I was horribly abhorred by that point and I could never forgive the sick joke. I have nothing against movies about being gay or homosexual. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they might say. "In & Out" just screams for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​the corruption in the core. What I downloaded from the movie is that if you are 99% straight and 1% homosexual, which means if you have that ambiguity, you are YOURSELF GAY. It's like gayness becomes a dominant feature of genetics. In fact, if everyone told you again and again that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn't you? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, actually. This was a seriously ill and cruel movie, the WORST of 1997.
