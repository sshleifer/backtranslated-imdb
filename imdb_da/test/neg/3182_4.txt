I rented this movie because I enjoy watching things with Lauren Graham in them. Now she was the highlight. Everyone else seemed completely separate from the picture. You kept looking around at those who watch the movie with you, what? But she gave some clarity as she was the only normal character in the picture, who actually didn't say much to the movie. Personally, it was too far for me. However, I am glad that I rented despite the fact that I would never want to own it. I still feel that Lauren Graham turned out to be a strong actress and even thought she wasn't the protagonist, she seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and cared more about her character ending with Josh's character than we were about the two main characters.
