Don't blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please apologize bad English). It made me see these movies that make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It made me even more so to see animal murder and hear Americans say that's how Korea is. We do not eat live animals !! So wait to apologize for the film for its crime by saying it's the culture! There are scenes with the man eating live animals, and non-Koreans think it's normal. No, it is also disgusting for us. The director is a misfit, sick person who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. I want America and France to stop glorifying this bad man, who is ridiculous in his own country. Please see ALL OTHER films from Korea that will give you ideas on how artistic we really are. This movie is bad.
