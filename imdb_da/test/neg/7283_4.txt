HANA-BI has many quiet moments and rather slow pacing. Unfortunately, in the many thoughtful intervals, it is left to consider the recent scenes that have just been seen, and many questions are superficial and annoying. Why, for example, did the wheelchair penetrate the sea when he got stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him? There was no rescue seen or suggested. <br /> <br /> Is it true that the Japanese police are so incomplete and unskilled by arrest procedures that one does not first remove the suspect's ability to reach a weapon? These Japanese police at the detective level did not seem to have any experience with a suspect. Why doesn't the main character's right eye blink? Having an eye blinking was distracting and it went inexplicably. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the protagonist spending all his money on borrowing so much from loan sharks? He was not seen gambling. Being a non-governmental government employee, his wife must have had full health insurance. What was the only man doing himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? What was his reason for being there? <br /> <br /> How in the world can gangsters find the protagonist and his wife in the distant nature reserve? It made no sense. <br /> <br /> And how could the pedestrians later find the protagonist and his wife in remote Mt. Fuji resort? There was absolutely no trace for these gangsters to know for themselves which country the protagonist and his wife were in, let alone the right specific location at the right time! <br /> <br /> And a third same question, how can junior detectives know which few feet of the Japanese coastline find the protagonist and his wife? The Japanese coastline must be large. Were all these characters supposed to have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The sweet girl is trying to fly a dragon on the beach - where did she come from? She seemed to have no transport or companions with her. And why in the world did she still try to fly what was left of her dragon after it was torn down?! This was strange. Accidental Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and fluid and added a lot to this movie. Photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> One last point was the wife too pleasing to the eye. Not even did she ever come close to resembling a dying sick person. She looked very healthy. If anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically ill. The man treated his wife as perhaps a newly done gay man would treat a respected wife ... a love of friendship but not close tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed movie safe.
