I was a little disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ..... different. I rather enjoy having a movie in your face and pushing all the buttons that make "squirm" for you. Tetsuo did just that for me, get movies can. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy a breath of fresh air, those who appreciate the terrible styles used to make the indie films so immense, Testuo II will probably be a dissipation. If you are looking for the visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" feeling of the first movie, skip it as all have been removed. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood-style action flick. I was a little confused. But it's still worth it in my opinion for any die-hard Tsukamoto fan.
