Seagal has apparently lowered its (already low) standards even more and has now surpassed making bad movies. The foreigner has no substance whats ever in the script. It's director has done an even worse job, and the music and score are so cheezy and wrong that you just don't know if you should laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes in the movie, you just turn it off. But considering Steven Seagal's earlier films, you think 'Hey, there can be some cool action sequences, at least worth watching ...' ... you're wrong! It only gets worse when the movie progresses. Everyone (with few exceptions) seems to kill any person they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it has an end and that it has a very short maturity. Summary of the movie in two words: STAY AWAY!
