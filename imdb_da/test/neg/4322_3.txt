SPOILER AHEAD! The mama (Lon Chaney Jr.) is loose in a New England college city looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess Ananka. Boring, slow (even in 65 minutes - it moves slower than the mummy!), Acted indifferently, but the end is worth waiting for. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages quickly, as both slowly sink into a swamp. This is (I think) the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster got the girl! Aside this is tightly amateurish. Probably the worst of mummy sequences - and that says something!
