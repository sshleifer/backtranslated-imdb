This movie was completely and unambiguously horrible. The plot was so predictable and boring, and the manuscript was so cool and pretentious that at the end I would open my eyes to the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't write reviews but I was amazed by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the play was okay in some parts, the script's lack exceeded the decent play. The only reason I saw this was because some of my friends watched it and introduced it as probably the worst movie ever made by the trailer. We were not disappointed at least. The only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to get to know you. <br /> <br /> FUN: You just want to get into my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I can't see you wearing any pants in this equation. Overall, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I've ever seen that took seriously.
