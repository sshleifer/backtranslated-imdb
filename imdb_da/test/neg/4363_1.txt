<br /> <br /> This movie sucked! The first one was far better. No one from the first has returned in this stupid sequel and somehow it is good because of the bad action, but the characters in this movie are not even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Give me a break! I'm surprised killjoy's friend, Blair Witch turned out not to make a cameo. Bad play, bad story and just plain stupid and boring. DO NOT PLAY YOUR TIME!
