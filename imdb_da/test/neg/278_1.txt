This was the biggest disappointment in a movie ... :( Sick, because I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> All the turns were crap. They were all flashbacks !!! <br /> <br / > What makes a good hoist movie is the credibility of the job. Yes, it must be surprising that the audience is stunned, but if you go away and go, the bulls are #! T ... what is the point? /> <Br / > Plus the main mound was still a bag, but you couldn't see the team operating at the full misleading and brilliant potential. There wasn't even a good hoist in this movie! They were all rubbish including the French idiot's break dancing crap at get through the lasers ... it's easy to do that when they are put together afterwards! plus that kind of thing has already been done in at least one other movie .. and it was stupid so too ... <br /> <br /> There is also no need to even have HALF of 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference does half of the cast really make to the result of this movie ??? The part SCENES doesn't even have to be there! <br /> <br /> The first was classic. This was CHEAP! And that makes the whole team credible. Especially Ocean himself to bend down Bennett.
