Jessica is a young, virgin and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote counter. Jessica is also a strong psychic, capable of dowsing, retro cognition, precognition and esp. When young and beautiful Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's forces ... until her abilities uncover a lost wristwatch and relieve an old treasure chest. However, the treasury has the separated head of a centuries-dead Satanist named Gideon Drew, whose forces are far stronger than Jessica's. Despite her warnings of evil in their midst, Drew mentally slaves everyone unlucky to get eye contact with him. But Drew wants Jessica most of all. He needs her dowsing skills to regain his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over humanity. Will Jessica's strong fleur de lis, combined with Gordon's love, ward off old evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. It could certainly have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the play is the leather, and it all goes very slowly to keep interest. Jessica is also too innocent - almost annoyingly so, and Gordon, her love interest, is wood, stiff and completely numb. None of the characters are very sympathetic, and the low budget is painfully obvious. A hasty end does not help either. Avoid it unless it is the MST3K version.
