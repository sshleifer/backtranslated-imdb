I was in this movie as an extra in the Dallas movie in July 1975. Some of the things you see today and take for granted in film production were implemented in this movie. The film prize, the costumes, the special effects, the actor. It all was ahead of its time. It opened the door to movies like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men" movies. Now people are watching it, and they say, "Well, that doesn't add up to this new special effects story ..." It didn't have any computer graphics and the new movies do these days. It had a story and a wonderful cast, and a hell of an instructor! The places it was recorded as the Dallas World Trade Center and the Zale Building, and Ft. Well worth the water garden was at that time the most modern and futuristic backgrounds to film. Director Michael Anderson was very creative, and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and weaknesses. It was my first movie experience, the first of six movies I've been to. Just because it was filmed in Texas, it doesn't make any less of a wonderful piece of filmmaking art. See it again and appreciate it more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many amazing movies that we now enjoy. Well, my hand is flashing ... I have to run. Santuary is waiting ...
