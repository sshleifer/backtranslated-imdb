Exceptionally bad! I don't expect much from Garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today, but Keaton should really have known that this movie would suck and go out while he could (not that I especially love him, but hi, he did batman). In a scene, Keaton is transported to a hospital that is chained and carries a face mask to Hannibal Lecter when two attack dogs bark on him (dogs can feel hurt you know (puke)) and Keaton swirls back on them and makes them back and gnaw with their tails between their legs. Has the movie hit comedy right there? Garcia makes fools of herself in an interrogation scene with dialogue Only a complete retard can seem plausible and the child is too annoying to be sad. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a movie with such a poor plot as this, you need some charm, humor, solid action. Take Die Hard for example, which is good despite its pretty crazy plot. Although Keaton's character was a joke, I touched him all the way. I wanted to see Garcia crying over his dead child and Keaton sipping martinis on some paradise islands! This movie makes a good laugh .. Watch it with a witty friend and you can have fun as this movie asks for wisecracks in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an insult to one's intelligence and a great waste of money. Greed made this movie and thank god it bit his own ass.
