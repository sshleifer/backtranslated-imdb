The story of Ed Gein is interesting, very interesting. However, this film is only interesting in the fact that it was actually made. Kane Hoders portrayal of Ed Gein is so far away, it's not even the slightest bit of fun. Ed Gein did not act publicly psychotically, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everyone and spoke to someone who would listen, this is one of the great things that this movie did not show the audience. But the biggest flaw in this movie, since from a frame ever shot, was that Ed never killed anyone without knowing it from his dead mother, whom he thought spoke to him from beyond the grave. He killed only those people who his dead mother said he had to, because it was God's will, and he was very annoyed at it, even though it did not prevent him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing human flesh. I officially rated this movie "1" simply because "0" was not given to me as an option. I highly recommend everyone to stay clear of this movie. If you want to watch a movie that accurately portrays Ed Gein and doesn't try to put a love story between a policeman and a fictitious woman who never existed, I strongly recommend that you see the original movie that unfortunately doesn't seem to be on IMDb.com, though I could be wrong, but I haven't found it here yet. The original does not differ from the actual events and does not attempt to twist the story. I can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie was just trying to change the true story in itself, something I find so terrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11, but made it a twist that Canada was behind it. Or another world war film that says Hitler was a good guy and helped fight Nazi.
