I understand the drawing and appeal to such a different type of movie, and I am a great admirer of movies with little dialogue, but all the same it is absolutely terrible. I have been to the Highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the signs disappointing. This plot was strong enough in theory, but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this movie from getting out of the ground. I feel the use of silence to create atmosphere works only when you have actors who can radiate a form of presence without speaking, and these actors certainly can not. If you want a quiet movie that captures the attendance test (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few movies that I couldn't even handle and that was one of them. Absolutely dribble!
