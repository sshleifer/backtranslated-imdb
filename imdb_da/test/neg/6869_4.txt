Visitors are a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and led in the pacing that I sometimes ran out of the movie. It was 11 am on a hot and sunny day I could add, not midnight on a cold winter night, so you get an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> Strange thing is, it's not long. In 100 minutes, it's just ten minutes longer than the average for video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf I had seen the day before. It just draws a horrible mass, enough to lose interest. <br /> <br /> When it fails S-L-O-O-W development for the atmosphere, visitors are good enough to excuse how slow things happen. While the backlinks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round off Radha Mitchell's boat woman, the haunts / foreigners / whatever is actually scary and effective, especially when her suicide moments appear and start moaning at night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop as well. Single boat is a creepy place, and sometimes the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare hell out of you. <br /> <br /> However, I find it difficult to recommend Visitors. I came out of it, not only to feel that I had just seen a 4-hour movie, not a 100 minutes, but also the feeling as if I had been cheated in some way or another, while giving many explanations about The haunts (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space Aliens?) Visitors do not choose one for sure. Anything that sees Radha Mitchell talk to his cat and Dominic Purcell smells for no apparent reason for any inexplicable horrible event in the past, for nothing? Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened but wildly / stupidly you might think so. If you don't see many of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve something, but I found this slow, boring, and very derivative. If you want to scare yourself stupid, there are much better places to do it, if you want a smart thriller, there are many who are smarter.
