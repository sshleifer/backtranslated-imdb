1980 was definitely a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. "Friday the 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best, but as always, there were a few stinkers not far behind as "Don't go into the forest alone" and this one. But in fairness "The Prey" is not as bad as "Don't go into the woods", but it's still not amazing either. One thing is that it is just boring, and the play is not so good, but much better than "DGITW", and this film actually has some attractive looking females to watch, all three female leads were amazing. One thing that happens to all the senseless wildlife footage it just seemed meaningless, and it looked like the director used it just to use it to fill up some time. <br /> <br /> So what was there about this movie? Now there were a couple of laughing loud cheeses - I couldn't contain a fixation of giggles when the final girl made a bizarre type of backward moon walk to get away from the guy and there were a couple of good kill scenes - my favorites are the girl smother to death with the sleeping bag; and the false look. All in all, The Prey is stupid, boring, and the killer did not find me scary at all. This movie could have been a lot better.
