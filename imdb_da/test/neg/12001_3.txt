Of all the kids movies I've seen over the years, this was probably the worst. I took four children aged 7 to 11 and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka style story, but it just didn't matter. <Br /> <br /> If you are considering watching this movie do not waste your time, it is bad. <br /> <br /> They make a sequel so it may be worth seeing to see if they can make even worse movies, but I don't think it's possible.
