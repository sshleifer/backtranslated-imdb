Even at the lowered standards of 80's slasher movies, this stinks. The usual alley of over-sex teenagers leads to a "forbidden" part of the forest that burned in the 1940s and apparently left a single angry survivor. Fast forward (in fact you would like to speed through much of this mess) to today where a few campers are slaughtered; teenagers follow in their wake, while a half-worried park ranger (a sleepwalking jackie coogan) and his healthier cohorts (who spins a lot of time reconciling his banjo) partially succeed in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the- mill nature-footage upholstery. Finally, more kills - but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. To see the kids slaughtered, select SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first Friday of the 13th of this
