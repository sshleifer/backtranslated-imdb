The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to contemporary times is not bad. After all, it can revive the series a little by injecting a new story element into a series that Hammer has all exhausted in a wide range of generally outstanding films. But because the present turned out to be the crazy early 1970s, the results were rather stupid and so much more like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a movie filled with 70's hip lingo and electric guitar chords and ridiculous rock music just seemed silly. To make matters worse, the play is much more over-the-top here - with an intense and stupid performance of "Johnny Alucard". I also thought it was great fun that it took Van Helsing's grandson to note that "Alucard" is "Dracula" played backwards - no one else counted on it himself! Wow, what clever !! <br /> <br /> So, because so much of the movie was bad, why was it still an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know, it will sound very sexist, but if I were to see a bad movie, Stephanie Beacham's character had at least some really lovely clothes that revealed her abundant .... "talents." So at least it was a beautiful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> That way, the movie ends with the phrase "May He Rest in Final Peace" at the end, although this was not the final Hammer Dracula movie with Lee He returned to "The Satanic Rites of Dracula" map time later, and in many ways it was even worse than this dud of a monster movie.
