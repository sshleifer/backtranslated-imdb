How did this movie come into the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it came into the panorama, but still. <br /> <br /> This movie featured: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever caught on video. <br /> <br /> The one clinician who accounts for most of his festival accepts is the presence of the old standby: homosexuality. It is true that the only thing that happens in this movie is that a graff-artist does with another and removes him. Then he feels strange about it and they have a boring old "breaking up" conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in the middle school (with lines like "You kissed me first, guy."). Oh, and by the way, this is not the Crying Game ... you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from that, it's mostly only bad tags, badly "undercover" cops, some skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the topic is of interest to anyone, I recommend looking around the internet for some underground graffi videos taken by real graffiti artists. There's plenty out there ... and they're a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap.
