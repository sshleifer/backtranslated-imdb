When we looked at Enterprise for the first time, which we all undoubtedly do with all the shows, I went into it with open mind and enjoyed about half the previous Star Trek effort and dislike the other half. <br /> <br /> The company has fallen short, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" seriously questioned me why I am disturbing the show from Monday night on Sci Fi. Masking an idea that it is one of those 'A Day in the Life' episodes where we learn what makes certain signs work as humanoids, the authors seemed to forget that this should be a starship vessel, not Ricardoes and Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people had been offended earlier by the Enterprise crew (to eat in public), was not room for a dog. As an animal loves myself, I would never have taken one of my pets in an environment that had previously proved to be tense. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, which constantly portray things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as they provide some insight into American religious jealousy. Foreigners were now offended when the dog was urinating on a sacred tree, yet foreigners were able to urinate the dog as an insult. <br /> <br /> Strange how the dog's urination was not considered a form of worship. I wonder how one came from the show's authors. <br /> <br /> From here we are exposed to a captain who was spoiled by his duties. When I saw the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was to be the ship's captain. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we get more inanities of behavior (sigh) We must not understand, and that makes us point to the browsers. <br /> <br /> The doctor adheres to non-chalant long, hairy toenails and nourishes them to starving beasts. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat escapes. <br /> <br /> Oh how to sleep with all this going on! Toenail clipping, to cry aloud! I waited for something feeds on vomit to be presented. <br /> <br /> Then we were inexplicably given the idea that the captain was in love with T'pol and that he might mask these feelings with his concern over the dog. <br /> <br /> Endless amounts of waste. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick so you have sex. You'll feel better." And of course, the captain had to apologize, and we humans had to regard his excuse as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smiles very sarcastic) narrowly! Saw depictions as this infinitely drone out on TNG. Strangely enough, the only thing missing from this horrible episode was that the trip that offered its smirks and downhome boyisms that Bakula seemed to cover everything with the stupid dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog survived, so go play download.
