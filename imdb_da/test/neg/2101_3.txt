By renting this I do not expect to be blown away. In fact, I knew it would be terrible. It was just to see how terrible it really was. That's what comes with low budget horror. <br /> <br /> "Snakes On A Train", not to be confused with the Serbian summer fan "Snakes On A Plane" by Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman put under a Mayan curse that gets snakes to hatch into her and devour her from within. Her only hope of survival lies in a shaman living above the border, so she and her companion step on a train tied to Los Angelas. Throw a few passengers and hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, but the story isn't half bad. Nor is it half good. <br /> <br /> The action of this movie competes with a Sci-Fi Original, if not worse. Trust me, it's terrible. The snakes were another problem. They were supposed to be rattles, but most of what you get instead is mostly harmless having snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets very annoying. Good effects on the other hand, but not on the Tom Savini level, was actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> And another thing is the end just for the rest of the movie. I don't want to talk about this, so you'll have to rent it and see for yourself.
