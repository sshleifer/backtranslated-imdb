At first I thought this was supposed to be some comedy / horror when I had seen the body in the bathtub with the lady who just stood there screaming again and again, but as the film continued, it became more and more flat. The reason was stupid with a man disturbed that the prices of real estate have gone up, so now he dictates to call a radio psychiatrist and commit his rage because he has nothing better to do. Then the law becomes involved and desperately tries to make us feel like they really care about who is calling and goes out of their way to track this guy down. One suspect after another is accused. This movie is horrible and the slowly moving love scenes by Adrian B. and her husband are boring and just made me fast forward in the movie. Avoid it!
