Wow ... I suspected this to be bad ... But now I find myself with a loss for words ... Honestly, no words from me can make this movie any justice ... <br /> <br / > I will try to say something anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is truly a unique gem. One of the worst kind. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - given her background as an actor - lashes with a Toltec sorcerer zombie during the movie's climax ... ??? A true kind of genius, no doubt. It seldom seems that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone. It happened several times with this. <br /> <br /> Actors' accents, man, accents ... And the dialogues I heard them speak ... And the play itself ... I just couldn't "don't believe what I heard. The fat uncle jumps so loudly (when he goes up to the house with his little nephew) without any apparent reason whatsoever ... <br /> <br /> Breasts! Yes, that's titties! And female ass! There is even a naked chicken in a bathtub drinking a beer ... one "stretching his mouth over his face" -kill was the bomb! A real highlight. <br /> <br /> The comedy aspects were just totally bonkers. I just couldn't believe what I saw and heard. For a while I even thought they were unintentional and shook their heads in disbelief. But halfway through the movie I started to get the bigger picture. Guess it took me half a movie to dump half of my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> I had a really hard time believing in this movie ... But that's good, I really think. It had a black chicken gone up to a very small closet, opened it and then said "Wooow, look at all storage space!". And she said it meant she meant it. I mean, it's a good dialogue and good actor, right? Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue's whipping skills suck big ass in the dark force. It is really boring and pathetic to see. It is of course part of the comedy. Or wait, I can be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was amazing with the whip! It was the editor's mistake. He shook it up, cut his lashes together and all. Or wait, it could have been the camera operator. He filmed from the wrong angles ... So why didn't Phil Smoot say anything? That's what it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. I just have to stop talking about it. I have nothing meaningful to say anyway, except the fact that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... sometime soon.
