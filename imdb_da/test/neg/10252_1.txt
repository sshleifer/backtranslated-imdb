Is it possible for a movie to get worse than this? There are a bunch of monkeys wandering around, mumbling b ****** that seemingly stupid and we should laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going. Even when the women finally come up, there are no signs of improvement; The most anticipated things happen, and when the movie is over, you may be asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash can! I can't believe there is even a sequel to this! <br /> <br /> 1
