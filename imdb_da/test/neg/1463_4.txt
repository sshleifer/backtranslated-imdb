It opens - and for half an hour - as a training program in the Old Testament, but not without humor. The movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant is dropped. In a mixed success scene, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to marry kicking the Apocalypse, and the last quarter of an hour is a kind of humanistic 'what's all worrying?' play-out gilded with optimistic conjecture against a (recurrent, extremely ironic) long shot of WTC twin towers. <br /> <br /> Apart from Donovan's authority, the play is shared. There is the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: This, though formally designed for biblical presentation, fits the modern, paranoid comedy that Hartley is aiming for. But I was also pleasantly surprised at PJ Harvey's contribution (so credited and in danger of being in the movie solely as the pop star unit she is, not least in a set piece of scene in a record company and a dangerous patchy soundtrack that contributes). She was cool - a kind of unpleasant lack of focus - like many pop icons that have taken on movies (I'm thinking of Jagger of Performance here), but still maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project. <Br /> <br /> Ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a little too much like one and relies more on endurance than its audience's imagination. 4.10
