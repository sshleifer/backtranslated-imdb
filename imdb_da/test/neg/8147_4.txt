Admittedly, I looked at the MST3K version of this, but it's not really wrong, at least compared to others who deserve my cinematic hate. The story is centered around a troubled girl who is mistakenly sent to a "reform" school "Girls' Town. Along the way, races, redemption and wackiness (unintentional) occur. actually entertaining to a degree if you are totally upset, all in all, just a simple sub par 50s flick, but far from the worst movie ever made with some bright spots in movies (the Ave Maria sequence was good for me) . <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see the MST3K version, you won't be disappointed by itself, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("nail someone?").
