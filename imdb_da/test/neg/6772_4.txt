Danny's sorry. <br /> <br /> He's making the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to see. At first I could feel like an abuser myself. My heart went out to him in the beginning, and somewhere along the line he crossed the line. It is almost as if he continues this behavior to keep the show going and at the same time he risks his life and the well-being of his family, especially his children. It is hard even to be ashamed of the poor boy. I think he should see this show, maybe he might be able to save this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I still wonder how much is only for show and how much is love. Danny, get a life - a new one there! ... and let me not start with Dr. Gary. What's with him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to max. Besides that, it doesn't matter, but he doesn't seem to be particularly impartial. I also think he holds this to his own monetary gain and often not in either Gretchen or Danny's interests. These people are getting confused, and each reminds me of a dog chasing the tail. sad, very sad. Let me pull you together.
