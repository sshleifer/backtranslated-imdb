For a country that has produced some of the world's finest playwrights and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of confusion for me, so much of Ireland's home cinema has been so appalling. Perhaps because the talented Irish movie theater has, by its very nature, been quick to give up their home country for career in the UK or America (Colin Farrell is a new case in point) and that the truly successful Irish directors have continued to work in Ireland and with Irish topics have made their film with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking in particular of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who switch between films with an Irish approach and projects filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> "Middletown" is very much an Irish movie, though two of the main actors are English. It is certainly well made by its kind and may have bent the trend that Irish films are not really very good; (Paddy Breathnach's "In Went Down", written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately, this story of fundamentalism is set in a fictitious Irish town, presumably in Northern Ireland, judging by the accents (Mid-Ulster Bible Belt, if you ask me) and presumably in the recent past (50s in the 60s ?), is so over-top that it really is ridiculous. Nothing in the movie is true, and you can't help feeling it, the author, Daragh Carville, has been heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor, and that everything could have been more sensible if it was put in the American Bible belt and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never as whimsical as this. It's all supposed to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way, and it is certain, though I was more inclined to giggle than frisson's to the right Reverand Matthew Macfayden's antics. He has the Ulster accent off clapping and there is nothing wrong with his appearances or actually that of Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays' wife, but the manuscript is so terribly derived that the good play can't do anything to save the movie. So instead of a step up the ladder to Irish cinema "Middletown" I'm scared, just another nail in his coffin.
