This silly, environmental Wannabe "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly doubled and stupid. There is nothing to solve about it. <br /> <br /> Plot follows some shark / squid creatures that appear off the coast of Florida and kill some people (including a dull, stupid couple with a whiny wife and a quiet man who sticks himself with a fork for some reason). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague side threat of something uneven again and again. It doesn't make sense, it's terribly boring, and it's the conspiracy plot sucks. There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: The same shot of the boat by the pair of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slips a dying patient's chest twenty times with a diffibulator without stopping, even though he is clearly dead; the porn-esque soundtrack; The couple's shots make love on the beach with three different themes ("That we come before us!") Do this; the old computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a beer guzzling researcher screaming "I know!" a la Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everybody drinks at least thirty bears during the movie (much noticed by Mike and "Bots"). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's certainly better than the movie itself. "How I like to fish, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Crow <br /> <br /> A star for "Devil Fish"; seven to the MST3K version <br /> <br />
