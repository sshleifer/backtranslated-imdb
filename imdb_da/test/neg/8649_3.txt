If this is film noir, then noir should be French for glacial slow. Take a draft of completely uneven characters, give them nothing to say, put it all together with free ultra violence, and you have the formula for a worsened dash. May become the subtitle "Sleazy Hollywood types of attempts to make money from Chinatown rip-off". Bruce Dern's one-minute part is magnitude better than anything else in this flick. That way I didn't like the movie.
