Creating a comedy is like walking a beautifully thin rope. It works either, or it doesn't. Grandmother's Boy is one of the movies that doesn't work. It may have some very fun parts, but for the majority it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler movie (Sanders himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35, and is the best tester and game player in his otherwise filled workplace. He ends up getting his apartment and things taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just spent the rent on Philippine hookers and not paying the landlord). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of All Loves Raymond) and her two roommates. <br /> <br /> It's the basic plot of the movie, plunged with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, who can't be recognized from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo), trying to get the testers to complete a new game as quickly as possible, a robot-like game that creates prodigy JP (Joel Moore) working with Alex and wearing much of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course all sorts of sex and drug related jokes . That is it. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie, besides the real conflict in the movie occurring and resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the movie, is that it is just not fun. It is completely insane and boring, and only sparingly fun. Nothing really happens. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole lot of intense swearing. You might find yourself laughing at a couple of funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, and don't even want to bother you with the movie. How this film was green-lit and how Fox thought it could make money would always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is just no entertainment value to come from it. None of the actors actually do good performances, they just act as idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner's comedy has been done several times, and sometimes it works (Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to think). Here it is just to make the movie even less fun than it already is. The random recording of a monkey and a pair of blonde breasts doesn't make it any better for the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few fun single-liners, this movie should just be out-of-the-way missing completely. It's not that funny, the whole plot is stupid, it's boring, and it just makes a horrible movie. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
