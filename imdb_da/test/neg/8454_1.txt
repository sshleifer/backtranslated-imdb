I caught this for a short time in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local ancestry (and its relationship to a hometown tragedy, namely the death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I must really come down to this movie. Due to the best knowledge of himself, the director decided to shoot the entire guerrilla style with unstopped handheld cameras and quick cuts. Such a technique may work for the violent violence scenarios, but is completely inappropriate for the rest of the material, which represents the bulk of the film. A stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a couch, hell, even a kiss on a first date is all shot cusinart style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter the drama. Martin also undermines his story by packing too many topics: Besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... did I miss anything? Undoubtedly, a better cast (and a better focused direction) would have joined these strands together as Martin certainly intended to demonstrate how a moral error leads to and maintains a wide range of others ... but good intentions are not necessarily a big one movie make. Just a bubbly mess. Martin, I know you're from my city and I'm with your husband, I'm really ... just doing a better job next time you did in Two Plus One.
