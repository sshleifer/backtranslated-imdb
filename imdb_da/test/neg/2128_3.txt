A man (Goffredo Unger) is found floating in the ocean among the wreck of his broken boat right on the Florida Coast. A helicopter winds him up to reveal both legs missing under the knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) is a marine biologist of some kind and conducts research on the dolphins at sea. While out on the sea, Hogan hears a strange high altitude noise. Captured he and Stella hire Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to locate and track the source, or something, anyway, as it is not made clear. However, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart) working on a rival organization called 'West Ocean International' is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose anyone in the organization. More people are attacked, and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is on the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra put everything out to sea. Soon, they find evidence that something monstrous and very unfriendly can fool under the surface. Along with rival scientist, Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon, and the United States Army, they set out to destroy the monster, but there are other outrageous forces at work as one does not want the genetically engineered being exposed to any cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr. This is far from the classic Italian horror and splatter films of the 70s and early 80s. The script by Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is sadly slow and will put most people into sleep well before the 90 odd minutes of running time. The monster is almost not used, large parts of this movie consist of recordings of boats and helicopters. Large lumps of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious 'who's behind' part of the story. There isn't really anything to talk about, a guy with both legs is bitten and one with an arm is about it. The special effects on the monster itself are generally poor, and it is shown in very fast flashes, disappointing. The support of virtual none helps to make this easier to sit through. There really isn't much to recommend this movie so I don't want to. Don't bother you can do much better.
