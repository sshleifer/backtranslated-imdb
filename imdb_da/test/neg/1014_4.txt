The 3rd of the series finds that Paul Kersey (Bronson) turns vigilante into revenge on the tears that murdered his old friend. I don't know why this movie pushed me into it, but it did somehow. I found myself rooting for Bronson to dry the floor with the punks. Every time he blew away one of them, I felt good. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good structure of the fireworks finale, where Bronson goes on a rampage. But in terms of action and plot, it just doesn't measure up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would come out as soon as I could, but it seems that people are asking about problems. I know there is the mentality we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here for people. I had to give it a 4. Of course there are good "blow them away" scenes, but it's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I am sure if these bullies really wanted them to get their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Black-nosedger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of joy. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum up, it is far from being the original point of death, but it is pretty good if you are just looking for an hour and a half to shoot them up.
