As a fan of Marlene Dietrich's film, I was very eager to see this "documentary film". I was also drawn in by reading rave review after rave review from national critics. It should have turned me off. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply boring and of course extremely overstated. You don't even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discussing her movies and this video. She does almost nothing but complains about everything. How annoying! <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Maximilian Schell complains constantly and usually with her being on camera ..... all for nothing. She just keeps refusing to cooperate. After a while this kind of thing gets really tiring. Why would Schell continue with this project with her attitude? He should have just said that the fine donna should "push it." <br /> <br /> Whatever you read, don't waste your time with this.
