just looked at this "movie" and it has actually made me write my first comment on IMDb.com, although I've been using for more than 9 years. The reason I saw this is because I like splatter movies and sometimes I like to test my boundaries and see what still chokes me. First and foremost, this film did not bump into me, not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it a movie - what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap. don't understand me wrong - I'm all against censorship, but this movie seems to me that it was made into a kind of fetish crowd that seems to come out on this type of sh * t.it didn't give you the same kind of disgust and guilt which one felt after watching movies as "August underground". The movie is horrible to watch, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers will show you how disgusting violence is. in the case of "niku daruma" it seems as if it was strictly awakening to awaken people. I prefer movies that choke because they are well done and well thought out, like Gaspar Noe's movie, or Takashi Miike's, or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - these movies will keep you for a while. This movie I will have forgotten tomorrow, and the only thing that will stick to me is the idea that somewhere out there, there are people who wake up by looking at this. If you read this, take yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - of course, this does not apply to good dogs who just love splatter. you are cool! peace
