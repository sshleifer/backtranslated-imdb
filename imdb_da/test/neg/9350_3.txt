I can't beat this movie terribly, because it's obvious midway through the monitoring that they were trying to do it badly, or 'campy' if you prefer. Still, many of the parts they were trying to make are actually, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, which is actually played as a reality! Ride your head on the bumbling robots ... Oh, wackyness! And see it all go way over the top near the end with 'time warp'! And the sexual inducers just keep on flying ... I'm actually surprised this came away with a PG. Oh good. A fun way to waste a few hours, but Star Wars / Trek this is not people. 3 out of 10
