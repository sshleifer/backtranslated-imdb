As a fan of almost any period drama, and by the huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I constantly compared the two and this fell very short. It felt enormously rushed and very one-dimensional, so it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be nothing subtle about the conditions, especially Fanny and Edmund, and a little atmosphere despite being put in a beautiful location. Despite looking forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas, I switched it off after an hour and went to bed. I would be interested to see the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey that I have no loved version to see if they still manage to drill me in such a way.
