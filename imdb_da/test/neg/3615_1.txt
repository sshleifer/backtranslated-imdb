Now we know where they got the idea of ​​snakes on a plane. To put it all, don't pay to watch this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, either take it on cable or get it as a free choice from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent this. If you pay to rent this, then you are a stupid person. The action was horrible, the plot was terrible, everything was terrible except for the snakes. Whether they were real or CGI generated, they looked good. But that being said, this movie still has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the naked dance scene was pretty bad, I actually quickly forwarded through it. Not sat I warned you not.
