Well, the episode I just looked at had the older "Gastineau Girl" whining about why people continue to mention her husband (Mr Gastineau, a famous American football player apparently). She does not seem willing to accept that he is the only reason she does not change burgers, she married someone famous and therefore she has cameras pointed out. <br /> <br /> When challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderful circular reason why people should be aware of her: "I work very hard on my reality TV show". Then she said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who this series is supposed to appeal to, except people who have had everything their intelligence removed. It is certainly no role model for anyone except gold diggers, as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all that tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems.
