Comedy? What's so funny about seeing an ugly deadbeat alcoholic who attended 6 sessions (when I turned it off) by alchoholics anonymous? Get rid of a violent script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. Served with lashings of Hollywood's religious "God will save you" redemption drive. Another reviewer mentioned Tea Leone's "Sassy Dialogue". Now I have managed to see almost an hour on this boring movie, and I still haven't seen anything sassy yet - in fact my 80-year-old grandmother has more fun comebacks than tea character in this nonsense. Tea is more rocky facing and shows less emotion than Keanu - in fact, one wonders whether she is not dependent on anything - maybe botox is her face then wood? Avoid being killed with boredom from this movie.
