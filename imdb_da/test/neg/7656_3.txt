This movie is not a little bad. It's not even a little bad. It's terrible. You know you're in trouble when Charo shows up in a movie. She must have had the week from "Love Boat". George Kennedy, at least he's a gamer - he's in there trying. In fact, he's okay. And it's good to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is okay. There is a little better play than in Airport '75, but which movie doesn't have better plays than Airport '75? One thing I liked about this movie is that it went beyond plot-wise. At least they made an attempt at subplots. What really hurts this movie is the special effects - ugh! Not so special if you ask me. It's the kind of movie that is really 2 o'clock, really fun if you've had fun with your friends and you're looking for something to laugh at.
