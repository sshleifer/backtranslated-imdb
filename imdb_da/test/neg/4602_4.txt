Obviously, this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had a revelation of Charles Bukowski's work. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987's "Barfly", who also starred in Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen the 'Factotum' should definitely see 'Barfly' to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks Bukowski's plays and the untiring hopelessness of his lonely heroes. The unintentional humor bubbling through in the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures does not work for Dillon, as it did so admirably for the obese dirty, soft-woven Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the last night's miscarriage a place for yet another terribly ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown author. Dillon's character lacks these characters in favor of a chattering, beautiful, relatively pure-looking wanna-writer who hardly passes a moment in Chinaski's history. Dunaway's veiled heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The women in the 'Factotum' cannot keep a light on Dunaway's 'horrified goddess', and the use of more profane sexual issues in 'Factotum' proves to be more of a gross distraction than a tip of Bukowski's raw and unapologetic depiction of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned by how many of the exact same scenes were used in the 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei buys all things and charges it to the old man is an accurate rip-off from 'Barfly'). <br /> <br /> To see the best Bukowski stories on film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a dog from hell' (also titled 'Crazy Love').
