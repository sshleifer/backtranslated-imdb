Now I understand that it took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty sure my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn't even be aware. Just more proof that the boob bears women cannot always save you from horrible writing, action, and direction. Now I understand that it was a no budget effort, but there is also no continuity and no real reason not to turn it off and see infomercials or foreign news in a language you do not understand. Oh, there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still, there are not enough sexy women alive to guarantee to see this travesty committed in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes in my life. I trooped it though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you might use it after this hack job. Finally, the individual (moron) who left a comment before my thought it was a great movie and LOVED it. Just more evidence that siblings should not make progress. OW, BURN !!! - Captain J
