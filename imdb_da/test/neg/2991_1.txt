Don't make me wrong: I enjoy art house films, low budget tabs, character studies and foreign films. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy this - glacial pacing, complete lack of plot and signs that you don't like enough to hate, but you can't tolerate enough to suffer. <br /> <br /> To me, distant was to look at the workshop's floor film on a reality show - all the scenes considered uninteresting, which would not normally make the final cut, were the only scenes included. A camera in my apartment with two of my friends running for hours does not make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Clearly eliminates the viewer feeling that way - long distances without dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits) can be made work (2001 comes to mind), but for me something else convincing to me. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of watcher that can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis, maybe it works for you. But if you are someone who chooses to watch movies to relax, expand your mind or be entertained, then you should look elsewhere.
