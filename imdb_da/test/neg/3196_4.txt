I saw a big clip of this movie, which I will talk about later, and then the cast list, and thought I might as well give it a try. Basically, a bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his cousin cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and murder research detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something they have seen the dream girl (either married or not) and they would do something for to please and be with her, even die. All three met / saw her "one night at McCool's", the bar that Randy was working on, they have no knowledge of each other, but all three can't stop thinking about Femme Fetal Jewel Valentine. All three tell their stories to anyone they hope will listen to their rather intense and revealing stories. Randy talks to the hit man Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film), Carl to psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba McEntire) and Dehling to Pastor Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they have been willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they are all united in one place, all intentions of being with her and everyone involved in the final shootout that leaves one dead, one runs away (and eventually dying) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious because it is sex-obsessed Douglas). Also with Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I were to pick a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned in number 11 with Cool Hand Luke at the 100 greatest sexy moments when Tyler copycats the woman washes the car with suds over herself and in front of Goodman, very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable movie. Okay!
