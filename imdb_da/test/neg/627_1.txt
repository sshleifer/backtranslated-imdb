Precisely, stereotyped and beautifully cast, the story loops in a wide and confusing arc that leads you down a series of garden paths (without the colander) before choosing an end that feels like you're leaving - hole. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump, it will be a disappointment. Despite the protagonist's notoriously overt sexuality, I felt he was androgynous, lacked a clear male person, rather than his lack of a clear French persona. Although with an ideal view he is naked (or rather naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as ignorant as the character as motivation - the little thing called plot. Probably a stereotypical English-speaking point of view, at least if you take the film.
