This is a tough movie to consider. Although it really deserves its 3 (or maybe even two), for an Al Adamson movie, it is unique - and virtually Adamson's very best. This is because, unlike many Adamson movies, there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent. But being an Adamson movie, you know sooner or later that crappiness MUST carry its ugly head! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a certain bizarre cult leader of a large congregation (six) trying to revive a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. In the wake of the cult, however, there is a heart attack and it is taken to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it seems that many of these scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the movie. In other words, when you watch the movie, he seems to have possibly recovered - only to hear later that he was dead. Because the guy is b.f.f. by Satan, however, his evil soul cannot die and he returns to both haunt one of his minions and holds nurse Sherri. Now Sherri is apparently a very disturbed woman - demonic possession or not. At times she seems like a zombie and in others she is violently mistreated. So I ask ... "Why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think it was problematic?" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he also does not get an exorcist or commit her to the booby hatch !!! Oh, and talking about boobies ... this movie is NOT the full-bodied sex body, its title and posters will indicate. While there are a few mere breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and only very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but a scene. So, if you are a perv, this movie is not for you - although a few places in the movie (like the nurse adheres to a patient) make it look like the movie, it could at one time be designed as a porn flick. <br /> <br /> However, if you are a bad movie fan, there is enough to make your appetite more. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that are not zombie-like - and I'm not even talking about Sherri. Particularly noticeable is one of the very first scenes - I have never seen and heard any stylish acting and dialogue in my life - and this includes Ed Woods movie! There are also a few more cheap hands, such as the bad animation of the "green stuff", the doctor finds a murdered nurse but continues to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (I'll get a cop ... yet better, an army of police). <br /> <br /> So despite these issues, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Now the story is not that bad, and he was able to build excitement very well. Many false alarms started to make my heart run a little. Also the car crash, while it was irrelevant, came out well and was largely a big budget for Adamson. Overall, it was not a good movie, and one of the most would be bored. However, fans of Adamson or scary movies like it - it gives some entertainment in a cheesy way that will make a few laughs.
