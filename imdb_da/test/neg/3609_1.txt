Thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption I have ever made .... <br /> <br /> Fuel does not adequately describe this movie! <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot thin, but I get more emotional action from my pet fish! It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, who I respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with ... <br /> <br /> I think a cardboard cut out by Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job and actually been more animated. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! This can really be dangerous to your health!
