I remember catching this movie on one of the Showtime channels. The thing that stood out for me is that this movie is entirely in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there so I can easily see the place. <br /> <br /> Whatever kills a ninja a scientist because they wear yellow jerseys and golf pursued by the police. It takes about half of the police force to take him down, and when they finally kill him, there is no traceable sore. However, his spirit lives when a woman finds her and touches his katana. From then on, she is regularly occupied and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja comes from Japan to kill the evil ninja. This can be a plot unit from the two previous movies, or perhaps a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very campy, bad and entertaining. This is something to watch with a tub of popcorn and more friends and give it the MST3K treatment.
