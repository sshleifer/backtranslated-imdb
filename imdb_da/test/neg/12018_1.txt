I watched this movie in the theater and it was a horrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, now becoming worse in the sequel, is the greatest intolerance I cannot bear. Junior disturbed his father because he didn't want to go to school, which got his father Ben outrageously insane. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair for Junior for not letting him go on the trip. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer for Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior, so I can't tolerate this movie. Although the movie is being republished back to theaters in the extended version, I still wouldn't see this movie because this movie is not something I can tolerate myself. In fact, it stinks!
