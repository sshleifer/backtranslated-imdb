This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system for proper evaluation of this turkey. The action is either wood or over the top; The film was apparently NOT written by anyone in particular; and the scenes of the monsters were mediocre at best. Even as a movie run exclusively by the monster devils, these shots were so disappointing that they couldn't inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. I want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.
