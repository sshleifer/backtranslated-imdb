He's the only reason to watch this movie. He gives a very good performance - much better than this crap deserves. He is very nice and very talented - he deserves better than this. Also depressing is seeing Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who deserves better, but as Esai he gives a very good performance. So if you are fans of one of them, you might want to see. Otherwise, stay away. An additional complaint - could we not have had several scenes by Esai shirtless?
