I'm not quite sure what to say / think about this movie. It is certainly not the worst in the series (there is still "Halloween 3"). The style is just as different and it focuses on elements other than its predecessor did. It tries to explain why Michael Myers freaks out on Halloween and starts slaughtering. Well, all the things about Michael Myers are cursed and the evil cult was a pretty good bet, but I didn't buy it. None of the other rates in the series attempted to make fancy explanations. <br /> <br /> The movie contains lots of gore. In fact, it's common carnage. If you haven't seen the other Halloween movies, you'll probably like this for its blood content. But for a real Halloween freak, this sequel can be far too different to be seen as a good one. Suspense was transformed into terror and carnage (exploding heads ... you get points). The ending (theatrical) is simply horrible. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then popped up with a tube, then stacked again, this time with several needles, then turned up slightly until there is mucus that runs out of the head (where did these green things come from anyway?). Basically, it is nothing but waste of DKK 5 million. $. <br /> <br /> There was a good thing though: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite a disgrace. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
