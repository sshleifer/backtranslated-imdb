I always say "there is nothing like a good movie". And I have to say it was nothing like a good movie! Killing, boring and boring. It was like one of the bad dreams that never seems to end no matter how hard you try to wake up. I don't mind the concept of a film without words (ie into a fantasy or dream world), but there must be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty pictures, which is what this movie is. There was no sign development and it jumped so quickly from stage to stage that it was difficult to distinguish the story. (Was there even a story?) You could tell the actors who tried their best, but unfortunately bad bad direction sabotaged all the actors' work. It really seemed like a kind of cinematic masturbation ... only for the benefit of the director and no one else. Great waste of time.
