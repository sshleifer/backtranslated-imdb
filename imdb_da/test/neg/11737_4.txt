The 1998 version of "Psycho" had to be put back in the 60s instead of today's day. Headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a tender thumb. The first was at the start of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) sat at the desk. Her boss took his client into his office because "it was air conditioned." I imagine most of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Purple sporty Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. The movie spooked a number of viewers in the theater.
