Considering that Carson McCullers is one of the leading literary characters of the 20th century, it seems that it requires a very large lack of talent to destroy one of her stories, but this movie shows that it can be done! How do the actors choose their way to becoming directors? Wood, unatmospheric, unsympathetic, totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of McCullers' writing, my jaw fell into horror and disbelief that such a mish-mash of a movie could ever have found funding and backers. The only redeeming features are some moderately good actors, (though that is said, Vanessa Redgrave seems to do the same performance regardless of character she plays), and some good movie pictures in places, but otherwise it is a bitter, bitter disappointment And it could and should have been a modern masterpiece. Simon Callow had to hang his head in shame and stick to acting!
