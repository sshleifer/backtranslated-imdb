This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I've ever seen. It seems that the filmmakers did not actually read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The reason is out of order and slimmed down to its key necessity, but there is time for non-canon Olivier created incest hints between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had "something something rotten in the Danish state" bit instead? Casting is another problem. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie had its weak bits (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to think), but this one has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is outdated. Mel Gibson's creepy stumps are annoying, and you often wonder if he has an idea of ​​what he says. Many of the actors seem to have just remembered the part - they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, check out Kenneth Branaghs or even Lawerence Olivier. To be honest, Disney's Hamlet is also better.
