I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old. He didn't even laugh during the whole movie ... and he loves dogs and wants to laugh at almost everything! This movie was horrible from all aspects: bad script (although it was a child's G-rated movie), poor production (the horrible camera pictures made me feel nauseous in the first ten minutes), bad behavior (maybe was they "directed" to act cartoonish) and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the sound level works fine, so you can't hear what the next actor says). I am willing to put up with a lot when it comes to watching a child's movie, but it was worse than having a stick in the eye. I also did not like being beaten over the head with god-heaven-faith things. All in all, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I have done some serious time consuming in my day!
