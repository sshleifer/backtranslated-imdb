Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners looking for a missing crew of miners in the Namib desert. When they find them, they are no more than bones removed clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested in what exactly is due to this. The characters are good enough, and the play is pretty good. About an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what causes the bones to be stripped clean, you suck "oh, it's really stupid." The movie is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. Up until that time, the movie was pretty good, and it's a shame that it took such a bad trip. So I can't recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
