Spheerer used this documentary to push a stereotype punks. This documentary is prestressed and guided, not objective. The cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview can be used to take the spoken word from interviewees out of the context. When you watch the movie, the poor idea that comes from the punk interviews is that they are pretty stupid. Band members and other punks seem to be of little intelligence and unable to explain their motives or provide detailed or coherent answers or even answers to everyone. I very much doubt that if any of those interviewed knew what Spheeris created or that the final product would allow to be included in the project. This movie puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintentional and simple. Spheeris' film should not be taken as a representation of L.A. punk scene. If you want to see a good punk documentary from "Another state of mind" with youth brigade and social distortion.
