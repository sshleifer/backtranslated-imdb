It was, of course, a rather low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise had promise, and something more could have been done with it, but the script was not that big - the plot is incoherent and seems almost random to the times and the dialogue is set and horrible. <br /> <br /> Basically, a girl's father is beaten by gangsters, and later she becomes a robber and will avenge her death, and then it goes into a mob protection rack involving corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd gets top billing, but he really plays a much smaller role. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I found it mildly entertaining in its archaic B-class hokiness but it is really shoddy and pathetic.
