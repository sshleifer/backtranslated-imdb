This home video is basically scandalous, but you have to give them 3/10 to try. The blood is bad, but the grandmother who kills them is quite funny, and I think the concept is good and makeup is ok for a home video. But thank goodness it was only 55 minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally Fight Club (as in almost like the trash as the movie). Just read this comment, not see the movie.
