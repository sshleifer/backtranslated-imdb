This movie fails on all counts. For a start, it is pretentious, striving to be "significant" and failing. The manuscript was banal in the extreme, no one said anything distant interesting. It was impossible to worry about any of the characters. Knightly was an independent waste of time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The bit about the soldier who went to war was a cliché, even before the film's reconciliation used it. The use of the Second World War as a background was in itself a cliché ... the bombs, the protective in pipe stations, etc. ... involved in importing a little cramped drama. Why someone thought for a moment that this movie was worth doing is completely out of my understanding. It was another case of "let's get the costumes to look authentic, never something about the story, the script or the play!"
