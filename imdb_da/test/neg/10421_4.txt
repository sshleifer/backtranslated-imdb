What is it about the French? First, they (apparently) like Jerry Lewis do much more than the United States. Second, they seem to like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than anyone else does. It must be the "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Don't understand me ... I'm a Poe fan myself. But this trilogy manages to make three of Poe's under-average stories to ... Well, I'm not sure what they're made of. "Toby Dammit" is a fine Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's history, at least as far as the theme is concerned. It's fun at the first show. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. But it has nothing to do with Poe or spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How was Vadim's film produced? It's just awful ... not even up to amateur movie school standards. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the segment most faithful to Poe's work. However, it does not have much style, even though it contains the weirdest snowball fight I think I've ever seen in movies. (It seems the boys throw tissue or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up in balls.) <br /> <br /> My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", see "William Wilson" and then if You are a Fellini fan (I am not) holding "Toby Dammit" while cooking or making a snack.
