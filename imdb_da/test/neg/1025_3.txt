Although I'm not a big Coen Brothers fan, I'm an admirer of their dark humor film like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing'. I've been much less impressed with their other comic fashion, goofy-camp (or is it Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, where are you?' falls into the latter category and is not even as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. 'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of jokes without much point and not so much humor or wisdom either. As most reviewers have noted, the movie's plot is very resolved ?? and as far as I could tell, pretty random ?? based on The Odyssey. Its protagonist, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" as his homeric namesake, and has as his "real" goal homecoming to prevent his wife Penny's marriage to a suitor. Of course, we do not realize that this is what Clooney / Ulysses character really wants, until long after we have stopped caring. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" Chain Bands, and the Ku Klux Klan meets a la "Indiana Jones" cult collections, an unrestrained lawyer's vocabulary, a blueberry country music song talent, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a Clark Gable lookalike hairdresser and other random and different characteristics and encounters? I leave it for others to distinguish. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in the' O Brother's' title is just as pointless. Yes, viewers who are familiar with Sturges minor screwball comedy classic can find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression film Sullivan surrenders to Hollywood and comedy hopes to do. And they can even be mildly amused by a couple of shot / scene riffs (eg jumping freight wagons, and the chain band shuffle in a movie). But then what? The Coen brothers do not seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art sake of morally high-serious critical debate on the function of art. Of course, they fall into the former school, but it does not seem to motivate the reference at least. Is it a tribute? If so, why do it? I like postmodern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it is much nicer when it corresponds to something at least tonal, if not thematic, consistent ?? and not just an arbitrary collision. <br /> <br /> This manuscript is simply a silly mess. The only consistent and consistent pleasing element is the folk / country music soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the movie it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I recommend using the price of recording on the soundtrack CD.
