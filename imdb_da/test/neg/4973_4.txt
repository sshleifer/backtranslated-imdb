Now it's 2008 that really has a care in the world about a guy like DB Sweeney, even then he wasn't a big deal. Two tickets to Paradise are a sketched story that is good and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal relationships. Again, a proven plot. The problem with this movie, except that it's so bad it's convincing, is the script. Cliché by cliché three guys doing the same things you've seen in every other road movie ... and blowing water white houses. <br /> <br /> John C. McGinley's acting job is amazing, especially over the late DB Sweeneys. (His career is dead, therefore late. Even though I hear he's moving to TV, it's good for him). Also John C probably has the least horrible character in the movie. The result is so generic that it actually feels like you are watching a third movie from 1993 or Jeff Anderson's movie Now you know (also put me back a few years, but at least it was more entertaining.) I mean, I think I enjoyed parts of it. But the nerdy guy is annoying, DB is trying to be this tough-failed guitarist (with some rough influences like some of the worst classic rocks) who have some strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a gambler who is a wife and child leaves him after his father's death and a visit from one of his bookies' henchmen. <br /> <br /> I am thinking of ways to make this movie better. But I think burning the script would have been a healthy start. But as I have been constantly suggesting, it is not the worst movie ever. And any chance I have to see McGinley in a leading role, I'll take it. Hopefully he is starting to get some better projects.
