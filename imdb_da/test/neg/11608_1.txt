This film is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they have something interesting to say, done by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who believe they are interesting. Right from the coke-filled boys of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene. <br /> <br /> How many viewers are fooled into making them believe this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. Perhaps they secretly also belong to this overpaid and overstated "actress" or perhaps they have never seen a decent movie? Go out, put your hands in the dirty soil and get a real job. Otherwise kill yourself with a real gun.
