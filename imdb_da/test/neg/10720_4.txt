Unfortunately, it is not as good as any of the other movies that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked together, but some of them are definitely a grin visit. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he's being promoted to a better job. It is until the company with Dynocorpe drops and shuts down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni) and their son are of course in trouble with money. Whatever they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. So they start robbing a few places. And then they decide to rob the guy who put Dick up, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ridiculous bits are when Carrey is in the elevator that sings "I think I can fly" and the bit when he ties someone in a robbery and speaks to a voice changer (he sounds like a craprobot). Okay!
