Shortly after this movie was released, Salman Khan was handed over a 6 year prison. (Read on to know why I mention this.) <br /> <br /> And I hit a sigh of relief.Not that I was glad he got prison for something like because he was a celebrity but I was happy , it meant no more Salman Khan movies, no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting (read overacting). <br /> <br /> This movie had no meaning at all. <br /> <br /> The scene where the child belongs to one of the family makes a rocket that became voice activated. According to the movie script, it would chase anyone. But in the end it only finds Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well that's what happened. The Rocked gets activated in another foolish way, and you need an IQ of .001 to believe it. So, Salman Khan, who was on his water scooter, is shocking, and the hunt continues unless he finishes with all sorts of stunts he could show to the foolish audience. (In my view, all the people who have given this movie 5 and above, unless they are paid to do so.) <br /> <br /> Another breath, incredible scene was at the end when all events about marriage are made and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise comes and raises the marriage of one of the very unwanted songs. Further on, even though everything is finished and ready for only a announcement of govinda and Katrina Kaif to katrina's father and bingo. Everything is fine, and Govinda marries Kartina .... It made me wonder if conviction was so easy, why didn't they do it and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be avoided and doesn't even think it was worth seeing. The reason is far too disconnected with signs that jump from no where and ultimately disappear. For example, Choota don ... What a waste of characters. After this movie, I made a promise that I would not see Salman Khan Film for the rest of my life unless it wins an Oskar ... (hahahah ... which means I would never see)
