Okay, this movie could have been good if there was a plot behind it. The title doesn't even match it after the first ten minutes. The wind didn't have much to do with the rest of the movie. the play was subparent and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. <br /> <br /> As far as horror movies go, this should not even be classified as one. This was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere. I hate being so tough, but I felt like I wanted the time I spent watching this movie back. hopefully this will not be followed up. This movie must be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing.
