The two most notable things about "I don't want to play" are: It won an Oscar as the best two-wheeled short film from 1944; and it was led by silent man Crane Wilbur. The plot of this card's card is inappropriate, the dialogue lacks spark while the play is no better and no worse than that found in most war-torn Hollywood films from the 1940s (in other words, it is terrible). Admittedly, there are moments when "I don't want to play" is fun - Janis Paige's completely artificial look and line delivery is valuable - but you laugh at the picture, not with it.
