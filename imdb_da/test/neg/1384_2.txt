Much has been done about Carlos Mencia's (Mr. Holness, sorry) theft of other cartoon material. Hi, even before Joe Rogan had a fight with him on stage, I knew Carlos Mensteala twisted material from Cosby and Kinison and a host of others. To connect his theft crime, he told these comic genius jokes BADLY. <br /> <br /> And this is a crime he continues to pursue on this show. I'm sure the series authors should share some of the blame - it must be hard to write jokes day in and day out ... but that's why people are being paid so darned a lot to do it! These series writers have to go back to their daily job of flipping burgers or what they did before deciding to embark on an intellectual theft career. Not to say he steals all his material. You can tell when he has devised a joke on his own when what you see just transcends it and goes straight into the horrible fate. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h At his show, ten-year-old calls him a genius. They must grow up one of those days, Carlos, and when they do, you will dry up and blow away.
