Usually, BBC productions by Jane Austen are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What did they think? This movie has a bit of Austen's charm and ironically imitates the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the "gothic" sequences are sticky, over-the-top and honestly stupid. The actor, who plays Miss Morland, is badly thrown without obvious appeal to attract the attention of a qualified bachelor, and although I looked rather like the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he is not a bit like the novel, even when he delivers dialogue straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terrible "ham" performances. This movie was so bizarre and strange that I actually saw it again just to enjoy where freakishly wrong it was.
