This is the only movie I can think of where it eventually ended, I was left angry with a waste of money and time from myself and everyone involved in doing so. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal movie) after this debacle. It's not bad in an entertaining way like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you face your eyes. Plot holes size of planets. The worst script in memory. Terrible act of decent actors. Visuals that should be big but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
