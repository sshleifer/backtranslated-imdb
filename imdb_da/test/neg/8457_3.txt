"Terror in the Aisles" may look like the ultimate treat for horror fans, but it has very few to offer. Granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Selection of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classic but ... what is the point? This documentary is primarily aimed at the scary love, so we have pretty much all these clips already, haven't we? The only thing that is truly commendable for this project is editing. If you are in screaming chants, chasing evil murderers and such things, "Terror in the Aisles" has some nice compilations of the most famous sequences. All of these different scenes are linked by a lame wraparound story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a movie theater. In between two sequences, the address of the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. These speeches are, of course, soporific and quite obvious (it is in our nature to be scared ... blah blah blah) and I fail to understand why many people love the concept. This is worth looking into in case you are a loyal horror fan, but it is certainly not important to see. On the contrary: If you still need to see a classic genre title, make sure bits and pieces here do not spoil your future viewing. The main reason why I generally didn't like it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser-known but basic (foreign) titles that infinitely focus on "Halloween". This results in a cool inside joke, but when Donald Pleasance screams to the screen of his own character.
