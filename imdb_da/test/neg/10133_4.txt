The description of this movie is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with spider web, spooky music, a hypnotic medallion and of course a coffin with a crushing lid. On the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this page by Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires" and this movie predecessor, the modest title "The Vampire," the film sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. As I mentioned, this movie is a sequel to "The Vampire" that I haven't seen. But no matter ... it is really easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is befuddled when well-intentioned but disgruntled. Marion brings back his vampire enemy staked body, Count Karol de Lavud (I assume there is a rule somewhere where all vampires should be count of some sort). Dr. Marion complains that all major doctors throughout history have had to resort to some form of grave deprivation to promote their medical studies, and he hopes to use the body of the vampire to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of normal reflection (in which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection we see the vampire skeleton. Enrique is not satisfied and seems to be aware of passing the events of the first film as just fantasy and superstition. "This man was no vampire ... I admit he likes to drink some blood, but that's all!" he says. Also, confusing cases are the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) Who happens to be Enrique's subject of love. Martha fled tightly to Lavud's couplings in the first movie, and apparently Enrique spent a lot of time "curing her mind" and making her believe that everything she experienced was not right. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were a scriptwriter for this movie, would you need a way to get someone stupid enough to pull the stick out of the vampire, right? Well, what about the greedy con man who helped Marion steal the coffin? After catching a glimpse of Lavud's body, he puts himself on the expensive-looking brooch worn by the Count, and he returns to steal it when doctors do not see. But darn it ... he can't remove the brooch because of the effort, so ... you guessed it. The Lavud is again loose, this time with the shady con as his human hands. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, the vampire is again after Martha again, and meanwhile, the doctors are really confused about what they think. Initially, they are determined to prove that there is nothing like a real vampire, so at the end of the movie they are trying to get the police to put an all-point bulletin on "a man who is dead, but still alive! " <br /> <br /> You can imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers throw in a couple of pleasant twists. One of the sets for the movie is a creepy wax museum (is there any other kind in these types of movies?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... with real torture and execution equipment. The film has a very nice sense of style, and not just in campy cobwebs. An effective frightening sequence, the Lavud chased a victim down a seemingly endless row of streets and alleys, following their progress alongside vague, non-door buildings, while the scene of the scene as a German expressionist nightmare ("Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" seems to be an influence). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the movie is young, especially in the movie's climax. Special effects are pretty raw, even for the year that this was made, and the climatic battle with the Lavud in bat shape is ridiculous enough ... but the director feels he has to ask us to think that Martha would faint and fall together directly over the top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect place to be carved by the leaf that is in danger of falling because the retention rope has suddenly begun to break RIGHT AT THAT MUCH MINUTE! What an unfortunate accident! To make matters worse, he cuts himself away from burst ropes to scenes Enrique tries to dodge the swooping rubber bats, basically standing still and waving his arms around. It is definitely an Ed Wood moment if ever there was one, especially when Martha seems to revive herself and grows groggily to her feet, just as the blade strikes. Whew! What a relief! In terms of cooking, "Vampire's coffin" does not have the lunacy factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of these types of ancient horror movies will appreciate atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to twist some real chills from this material must "apply" to something (haw haw).
