This film takes many freedoms with the known historical facts. Even small things like Flynn lick a stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a damp sponge, is one of those annoying things. Flynn was never tried to kill or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother to love another man, and is not known to have had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and he did not join the sliding series in Sydney. He did not get his twopenny half-penny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by annoyance, and this role did not make him a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre movie where the name of Errol Flynn has been turned on to sell more tickets and more videos.
