The movie starts well enough. It's a really scary scene as a couple of refugees fleeing the law tear an innocent family living in a remote landscape by killing their mother and father. The young daughter only escapes through a mysterious spectrum that kills the two aggressors as she covers in a downstairs closet. Then we fetch her 15 years later as a drug abused student who examines the supernatural, lives with her prominent aunt and is looked after by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and holds bizarre visions that no one else can see. So yep, life is grand. Things get much more comfortable when she falls out with her mother's sister, who later found death in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched in the forehead. Hmm, I wonder who the police's main suspicion will be? This is quickly followed by several deaths, all connected with their relationship with our heroine has been badly seen with them before they passed. Could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation would be something more ethereal? Clue: If you think the former, you have downloaded the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the right, short-term gimp. As I said, I was ready to fast forward to the good parts, sure I didn't miss anything but a mediocre thrill of pot boiler. But the first ten minutes grabbed me and I decided to give it a try. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it was certainly not a masterpiece, but the play was good enough, and the manuscript kept throwing up exciting situations, which I was looking forward to finding the solution to. Alas, 45 minutes in, I realized that my attention is beginning to wander in a long sequence, where the protagonist walks around in a library, does nothing. We then get a cheap scare, followed by a quarter-hour goddook of the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a girlfriend. Things only got worse from there when the promising beginning is thrown out of the window as we get a compelling plot twist after the other, followed by an end so anti-climatic it is like being promised the moon and ending with a teeny weeny meteorite instead . Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it was bad all through, it would have been much easier to swallow. The fact that it starts at a bile and hardly ends with a lobster is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that started so promising end up being so formal? I don't know, and I don't care. Just give the author and instructor some advice for next time: Don't use 5 weeks to write the first part of your manuscript, and then 5 minutes to finish the rest. You tend to notice these things in the end product when you treat your project as lax as you have here ... 3/10
