Forty-Niner Curse does not deserve a long and detailed review, so I'll just make some random observations about it: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening credits. <br /> <br /> - No plot. Does anyone ever see a horror movie before and can't guess within the first 20 minutes who will survive and who won't be among this group of stereotypes? <br /> <br /> - The newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (made to look about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law have fun Kuna Black has a bigger role, but she's not funny - she's pretty embarrassing. - Martin Kove is on the screen for approx. 40 seconds, but still got its name on the video tape. Did they pay him for this look, or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4.
