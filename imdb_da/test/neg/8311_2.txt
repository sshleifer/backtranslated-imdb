As bad as this movie is, I really like it. The bad action, dialogue and action made it so much fun. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and stayed up all night and worked out how Death Machines checked into the airport, if they couldn't speak, probably had to shake / nod on the security issues. In fact why can't they speak? It fails to observe any kind of filmmaking that makes it oddly interesting to see - just a lot of people are killed around a very loose plot around hired killers - no "machines" as such and the weird face / mountain stuff on the cover cover and the trailer appears does not! I love the fact that there is no good guy in this movie until halfway through, and I love the many pointless scenes on the flying landing - many people are killed who have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given about something - Don't expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the great good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar - who is presented as the bad guy, yet speaks to the bartender's decision to hire a scantily dressed woman to dance poorly in the corner to "entertainment "- All the good guys seem to enjoy this! Why did the old guy hit our hero - and why did the random blocker decide to help the old guy in the game? Why did the hero fall under a blow from the old guy at the bar, where a stream of water sticks out into the background, so it looks like it comes from the mouth? Definitely Top 20 B-Movie, should check part 2.
