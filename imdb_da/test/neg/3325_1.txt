This movie was basically created to lack the study. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the play, but was rejected by the studio. Two, they tried to fire 2 depth novels into a 2hour movie. <br /> <br /> I maintain the only way for these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. First, Vampire Lestat takes place alone from the 1700s to the 1980s and has an abundance of character that is crucial to the plot understanding of the protagonist, Lestat. The entire book of Vampyr Lestat creates the events of the second part of the Queen's Queen. Without the full understanding, the premise of a movie is destroyed. Lestat was not cruel and vicious to anyone, he would not go with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not remain unharmed by the light, Marius was not After David or vice versa, each figure was completely wrongly represented, BASICALLY same names another story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Although you would be inspired by these novels, fine. But do not take piggie back into the theaters based on the success of the giant novels and characters to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books, you will not really understand the movie, if you have read the books, you will be offended. That said, I am such a big fan, I had to watch the film knowing well, that was the case and still went for it. Fang 22, must see it, will hate it.
