As a useful warning for others, I think "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I've used RI as an example of the worst original movie presented on the Sci-Fi channel, but the SM is the most ridiculously incoherent and miserable movie I've ever seen. Yes, I saw almost all of it, got into it about 35 minutes into it. It pulled me in with its pure ineptitude. What was Sci-Fi thinking? When Skeleton Man and the surviving record leader (or whatever he was - I'm not good at military unit terminology) reached the chemical factory, the film moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost fascinating. I had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone edited together to make a horrible whole.
