Very cliched. Absolutely corny. Action gets worse as the show continues. Do not believe in something that people say about "realism" that this movie should imagine. It's just a shoot'em up. Interesting twist in that the VC sieg base was given a human face and was not portrayed as maliciously incarnate.
