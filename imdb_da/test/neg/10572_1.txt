Went with some friends and one of my friends mom and thought it would be a good way to start the spring, but the movie turned out horrible. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialogue, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (under the waist). Not worth the time or money. Strongly encourage you not to go or rent it when it comes out. If you end up walking, do not take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family! If you're curious about the content, check out the Content Advisor section on the Superhero Movie page on IMDb. Most of the content that was supposed to be fun was extremely raw. Especially when they get the fun of Steven Hawking.
