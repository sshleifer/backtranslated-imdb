Anthony Wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) countless history, but the similarities stop there. Wong does not reproduce his role of course and instead plays a bumbling policeman who becomes involved in a rather suspicious woman, Fung (1994's Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), who is a suppressed node team. But her tame jealousy "will be with a guy who is with a girl" killer is not as nearly as convincing as what Wong played in the first. The movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan, when physchos love interest's incredible girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible, and Sun has a good ass, but even that can't save this dud.
