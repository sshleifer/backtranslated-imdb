This movie is an insult to the piece on which it is based. The character of Claude has been combed without recognition and leaves a painful achievement that does not even look like the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also carved a fairy tale of the original scoring value of the context in which the songs sang. This confuses the movie's air and causes the viewer, who is aware of how this should disappear, as the writer of this play plays Hud a wife, turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burger at to send him to Vietnam instead. If you are not familiar with the original plot, I assure you that this is not a bad movie that you can see, but if you ever want to see the original or am like a deadly fan of the classic game, then would do the best to avoid the movie altogether. You really have to stick to one or the other.
