While this movie had some scary moments (great use of music and movie angles to build excitement), it is obvious that Director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy did not waste any time researching their topic; who also causes me to question their claim that the exorcism scenes were being watched by a true Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many inconsistencies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first met him outside the church, has an academic cloak over his clothes instead of the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic garments are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels capturing weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is not from St. Paul's writings, not even in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic writings. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop, he doesn't believe in demon possession and knocks down the request to study exorcism, but does a complete 180 (later that day?) within minutes to talk to Isabelle. Sure it is possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as pastor / psychologist in the original EXORCISTEN for a more realistic depiction of a skeptical believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest beat farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes the scripture, and she quotes back. He says "I can see you Psalm 65" - she corrects him "it's Psalm 67" - they are both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who has just done an exorcism - makes the sign of the cross, calling on the name of Christ, using holy water, etc. - Jacob says he does not believe in the church, and he does not believe in God. (Maybe he's just in conflict?) Jacob listens to him to take on homemade vests and get someone else to go anyway. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former Roman Catholic priest, crosses backwards (or Eastern Orthodox style). As a Spanish Roman Catholic who used to be a priest, he should have crossed his forehead to the sternum, left to the right side of the chest. I had to read into the small page stories to get the concept of Satan shot with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure whether someone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it is pretty clear he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot twist with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or spear. <br /> <br /> Listening to the ongoing commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I tend to believe it was a joke.
