I'm shocked at all the good reviews on the front page of this movie and on IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 bin in your local video store. Saying this is a B movie, is extremely generous. In addition to lacking a single redeemable character, slightly better than average-acting and a nasty 80's style picture quality, the script for this movie is boring and lifeless. This movie is not only boring - it is pathetic. (Several occasionally there are some mildly interesting sources between the two main characters.) Even the final plot twist - rather the only plot twist - does not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" if you need to, but don't hesitate to turn it off when you are judged by its worthlessness. 2 out of 10
