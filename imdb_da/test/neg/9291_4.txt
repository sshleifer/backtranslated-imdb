Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to escape China and without passports. She's in a pile of problems, I don't want to say exactly what, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her out. <br /> <br /> I mention it because one of them complains that the Chinese include the bandits who are attacking The American mission in this story deep in the Chinese interior was the special institution by which US citizens who committed crimes were tried by US courts set up by our consulates. We were far from the only country that did it though. Possibly the story opens with her on a train to Shanghai, trying to use a hokey Russian accent. The accent intrigues Warner Baxter, which is beautifully polished. The bandits, however, interrupt the journey and the two seek leave in the American consulate led by Charles Winninger. He is the best in the movie, and I only wish that a better story was given because I liked his character. He is a widow and a proud member of the consular service appointed in 1900 by William McKinley. He requested a transfer ten years later, and that was the last thing he was heard from. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale, this is a truly forgotten man. He is the real forgotten man. Baxter fits perfectly into a role that a person like Clark Gable would have done in his sleep at MGM. The heroics would have been more natural to Gable than to Baxter, as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye had a number to sing. Why Alice's song was cut out, only God and Zanuck know. One thing I still try to find out is when the missionaries take a final refuge in the basement with a trap door, just who was left to pull the rug over the basement door? <br /> <br /> Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But blunt editing and lost faith in the project made 20th Century Fox released a project unfulfilled. Seeing Barricade is like eating a poorly cooked meal.
