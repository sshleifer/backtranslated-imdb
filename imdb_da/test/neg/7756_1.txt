My only regret is that one can't judge a movie on IMDb with a 0. "A Cena ..." would definitely deserve it! At least. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The movie starts with a bunch of people coming into a crypt to wake up an old vampire. When a guy cuts himself and his blood drops and falls on the stupid and dried body that is supposed to be blood sugar, the metamorphosis takes place, and the vampire, in an ANIMATION-like effect (would you believe it!), Take it quickly a more human form, only to reveal that he has a tux and a bow-tie! And BOW-TIE, yes. Red if my memory serves me right! I tried to check random scenes by jumping through a bit, but it didn't get any better than the opening sequences. It was supposed to be the movie and cursing it for making me hope to watch a Vampire movie. This is certainly not one unless you are 5 and could take such stupidity seriously. <br /> <br /> So if you like vampires and don't feel upset or even angry, learn from my mistakes and don't try to see this waste!
