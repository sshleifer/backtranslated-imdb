There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly. They did not make it so clear from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other. Not as natural as two people would (Age no bar) but force them to be around each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love. All in all, there should have been chemistry. That would have solved the biggest problem. Subjects with reservations about the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, regardless of the impractical. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe Jia's character at times. What I found harder to understand is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist who seems to be serious - would have been interested in a girl so lukewarm. Unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself that didn't come out at all. <br /> <br /> There is much use of Dutch angles or angles where the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that can lead to something that is not right. So the RGV itself calls the relationship unnatural. <br /> <br /> The camera's angles, background score, editing and even image and symbol compilation emphasize and over -phasise their relationship. Is the Indian audience so stupid that we have to tell something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two danced together ... it was clear what happened. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel the topic was very well-chosen. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact that it is all a controversial subject. If it is, handle it delicate, why don't you?
