This movie probably started with a good idea, but it's as far as it went. When I read the cover of Blockbuster, I thought it had a promise, but it was based on the overall idea of ​​the movie. The film began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation as to how it would happen, but it was okay, I thought it would be developed in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with pipes taped to their heads. Beside each are two attractive women. The men start asking "do you hear it" or "can you see them". We conclude that they think they see ghosts or any other creature that seems invisible or they hallucinate. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine in the first five minutes, BUT THIS SCENE WILL RUN IN FULL TIME. It is briefly drawn by flashbacks that have no connection with the so-called "plot" of the movie. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what seems to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is it about? We will never find out. Flashbacks lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolic attempts on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the movie, the terrorists finally make what terrorists do? They jump into the lab, but why? What's the point? We have no idea. This movie contains so many interrupted thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate, but one more notable is that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pops in and out of the room throughout the movie and does not even make the young men try to escape or even leave the tables they are lying on, even if they are not clamped! The film authorities also bring the como tree to cockroaches on several occasions, but again we never learn what has to do with the story. Sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and then I used to drive to the rental store and then to see it. Take my advice. Don't rent it.
