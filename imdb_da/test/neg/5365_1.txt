I was very excited when the paranormal state first came on A & E. I thought it might bring some more ghostly evidence. The production value looked good, and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to feel that this show might not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda. It seems that every case they investigate has some great powerful evil demons who can't even make a teacup on the camera, but everyone is scared. Then comes some power of Christ's ritual that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> There is also very little focus on other members of the team. The whole show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of the people who hands you brochures about his church on the street. Do paranormal phenomena and demons become Christian's new missionaries, do people frighten to convert? It really should be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
