I finally rented this video after searching it for many months. At first, I only wanted to see it because I'm an out and about Neil Pearson fan (Patrick, girlfriend of Isobel, the lead). The film, however, is very good without Neil (though he handles very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's a scary, intense movie, the kind of British doing so well - surely a "chick flick" in the house and it's isolated that gives the movie an almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The movie is full of excitement and the end, shocking, yet inevitable. I'm glad I saw it, it was worth the wait
