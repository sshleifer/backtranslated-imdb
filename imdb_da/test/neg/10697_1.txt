This piece of Crap is actually BOMB, as in the bottom of the barrel. I can't figure out which one is the worst; Norris' poor decoration of anonymity (not a big feature of an action specialist) or Christopher Neam's hysterical assault. This movie does not deliver at any level whatsoever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that should be horrible are similar to a clich√© from the 50's. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber boots and expect the audience to scream in horror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie doesn't matter to me. It actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flip and a Miami Vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of hell-alley. No, wait. It should have been hell.
