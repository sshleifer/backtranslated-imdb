Oh, my goodness!!!! This was the first movie Broken Lizard made as a group (although it recently came to video) and I have never been more disappointed with my whole life !!! I tell you what if I watched this movie before I saw Super Troopers (who is a kick A $$ movie !!!), I would never have seen it !! I had read several reviews online as well as on the front of the DVD that raved it like "Broken Lizard's Funniest Movie Ever!" Now if they were referring to Super Troopers as their funniest movie ever, I would agree nonstop but not this one. Talk about dry. It took the film a good 45 minutes to even get started, and then I was out of mood to see it, it wasn't even worth it. Maybe you have to be high for it to be fun? I do not know. I love these guys, I really do, but that movie is by far the worst thing they've done. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but one, just wow. I would highly recommend Super Troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more of a romance, drama, with some fun spots, I'd say go with the Puddle Cruiser. But my opinion is that everyone is entitled to their own! :)
