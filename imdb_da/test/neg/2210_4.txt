This movie is total stupidity incarnate. Still, I have seen this movie several times already and plan to see several times because, despite its sheer stupidity, it is very entertaining. And it has one of my favorite hokey film actors, Casper van Dien, who is here in his full hokey movie glory. Here is Casper van Dien's completely Casper van Dien, and you must love him for it. If he hadn't been in this movie, it would have been completely inflexible drunk or at least long drunk than it already is. <br /> <br /> The (coughing) "science" used here gives absolutely no meaning at all. No one else in the world noticed that the big asteroid is approaching the ground beyond the small group? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professionals and amateur astronomers constantly looking for heaven just for something like that? A large asteroid would have made it quite obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes, even vaguely capable of calling. And a piece of the asteroid jumped off the atmosphere and nobody even noticed it? A stone hitting the atmosphere would have caused huge shockwaves that would have turned, causing enormous damage to the planet's surface. Surely someone would have noticed such a thing. BWAHAHAHA! The "science" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous that it somehow works to make this movie as entertaining as it is. One thing I noticed is that despite the heat of the uber, all the signs are not dried with sweat and their clothes are completely soaked with it. At most, the characters looked as if they had been easily spritzed to the occasion of a person off-camera with a water bottle to give a "sweat shine". Authenticity was not a goal that this film effortlessly and constantly strived for. Which, in a strange and hilarious way, gives this movie its charm of entertainment. Is this movie actually worth seeing? Definitely! Assuming, of course, you have absolutely no expectations for something that is even approaching reality. And it is your desire to turn around and luxuriate in total hokeyness at the moment.
