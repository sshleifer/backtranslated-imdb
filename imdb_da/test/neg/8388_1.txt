To date, it's still the worst piece of waste I've ever seen. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it. Me and some friends rented it after looking at the back deck tank, we were part of a good scary movie. The baseline seems to change during the film, and there was plenty of irrelevant padding. The movie ended quite steeply, I guess they ran out of movies. The sound quality was gloomy, and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent, though she still spoke indecently. The guy gave a short eye candy until his bizarre attempt to murder. After wasting all the time to go into in-depth discussion about the workshop and its many power tools, he chooses to put a plastic bag over his head. All in all, by other thoughts, I think you should see this movie to actually believe it exists.
