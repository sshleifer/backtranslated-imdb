I mean, come on! This film had such a good potential, but it was as if they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole horrible rest of the movie about 2/3 of the way through. Signs start spouting these movies all the reason for the existence of other characters who do not ask for information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because it must be what is expected in this genre of film. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more. I really hoped it would be a good movie. There were some good actors. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the film falls apart, as does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them work and succeed in their craft. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for a while until her lines became equally unsustainable. I felt sorry that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movie's credibility for any thinking movie-goers. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has a surprising array of talent judging from another of his films, I recently saw, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of shit). This guy could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and be lucky with the right instructor. <br /> <br /> Almost forgot! The music was so heavily handed that you might think that this project was handed over to a smaller film school that was scored. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can just tell what comes next based on the music. Less is more at times. Cut half the music from this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite, or two, and that would be a very good movie.
