If a movie has an imaginative, hackneyed story and gentle characters, it is necessary to cope with it by being really great fun. You can get away with a lot if you are fun. But while there are a few entertaining moments scattered here and there in the grandmother's boy, they are so far and in between that they cannot begin to cope with the hacking work the film shows in such abundance. <br /> <br /> movies are definitely not surprising. When Alex saves marijuana in his grandmother's house in a tin, you know what needs to happen later and it does. The film appears to have been written by a committee that investigated mediocre comedies and grabbed some gag that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source of some clever comedies. But don't be fooled, it's not a movie about video game developers. This is basically a college frat house movie where all frat boys have been pushed into a great room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original grin can be seen in the character of the JPJP I think more or less composed of the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that he is a strange genius making games. <br /> <br /> In the film, J.P. a strange, unpleasant geek who is despised and the hassle of the company's game testers. It makes no sense at all. If you are one of the most important people in the video game history (as J.P. should be) then people will still admire and respect you at some level, even if you are quirky and unpleasant. If Stephen Hawking is uncomfortable, his associate will still not make him face to face. <br /> <br /> Also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as JP, but in the movie they are basically frat boys. It's a fun normal guy against the uncomfortable dweebs movie. And even though this formula has worked, it's often absurd in the game of a gaming company in the past. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, don't just set all conventions of movies from different settings to one. Unless you're a hack. About two-thirds of the way through the film I gave up. Something has happened that I knew would result in a number of painfully predictable events. And I realized that I didn't actually laugh at anything in the last half hour anyway. So I stopped (though I quickly proceeded to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable cliches they did). Normally, if a movie is bad, I just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenal scary production that it deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Shame on the movie to entice a good actress like Linda Cardellini into it and surround her with talentless nobodies. I give the movie 1 point to give Shirley Jones the chance to be anti-Shirley Partridge myself.
