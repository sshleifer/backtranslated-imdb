Watched this movie last night. I don't usually comment well or badly because I think movies are like books because there is something for everyone and everyone is different, taste varies, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. In the end, I thought this is testing my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they hit "rock bottom" and if I could just borrow some money from mom and do to live my fashion designing dreams - well, life would be great! I was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my beloved hubby likes to watch movies together and I knew it wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but it was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie watchers, and this movie was not. Annette Benning is a great actress she kept herself. Bath. Bath.
