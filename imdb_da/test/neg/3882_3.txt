I was too awe at the movie and looked at the promotion and went to see it. The FDFS movie was terrible to say the least. The first scene is good, and until they go to London, things are fun, but slowly the pace is turned off and they're not fun about it. Manoj Joshi subplot is fun in places but is undesirable and adds boredom. The drug is fun, especially the monologue. by Govinda <br /> <br /> The movie continues and continues without goals, just as a small child has written it <br /> <br /> The interval brings a twist in history, but then I lost hope <br /> The other half begins okay, but the way things are handled makes a mockery. The whole Arbaaz-Jackie angle is half baked Also how do people not identify them? <br /> <br /> Climaxet is quite fun, but stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this movie he started making craps and his movies became bad and bad. The music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stands out and AFREEN too. Camera Work I'm Good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white in his stump and looks old, but he works well, although this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy that seems to be tolerable , Govinda looks out of shape, bad and his action except monologue is boring too surprisingly from Govinda seems too much pressure on him to come back and Priyan fails to exploit him Paresh is okay in parts but generally just repeat action Manoj Joshi is fun in places Sharat Saxena is okay Shakti Kapoor is amazing Jackie Shroff looks overweight and works in his sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta shouts in honor but fails to act
