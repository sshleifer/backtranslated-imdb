Love sublime says the title. Another blur during the film's campaigns talked about inner to external beauty. Well in this case the beauty - you decide inside or outside - is provided with a little dressed (or is it rarely dressed / dressed) Zeenat Aman, as director Raj Kapoor called "a talented volcano" while the movie was made. One cannot blame him for sarcasm, of course - after all, he sold his own film. The thin plot is about a woman with a fatal face who has a well-organized body, a big voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He doesn't want her face only her voice. The action is desperate, and even the 4 are because of the music with Lata Mangeshkar, which gives some good numbers. The rest is of course bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty vs. beauty. !!! You do not have to be Einstein to find out which director focused on
