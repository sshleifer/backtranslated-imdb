Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be ranked as one of the most eerie moronic films ever made. I had expected at least some acceptable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved and after watching this movie, I can honestly say that I significantly lowered my opinion of Mr Davies. Why? The action is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the player and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr Davies was just on the watch and hoped the check would not jump. To say he just turned out would be an understatement. But at least he showed up. The rest of the cast looks like they sent it from their respective jobs at the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as a servant. Talk about a draft of unknown! This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they were being auditioned while waiting for the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What about the special effects? Big bought firecrackers, Styrofoam, a cheap rubber boot and CGI effects similar to those from my 1980 Atari Game. I've seen some awful special effects used on Sci-Fi Channel movies, but these things looked like cut-and-paste made on the nursery of another's child. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob would show up in the end to fight with Chupacabra. Not to mention that all of the creation's accounts describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. It would have been a good movie for a Leprechaun-like character. Instead, we get a giant hulking creature that appears walking with stop-action faster effects that are ridiculous. Chupacabra is in one place, and then it shuffles with super speed down the hall, and it is worth a few laughs to see this.
