Yes, I know his character should be a full one, and he may have been just acting goofy. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence really drinks a lot and was drunk during his scenes in the movie. Basically everything he says is blurry and often incomprehensible. Or maybe it was just the bad production values ​​... hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Race for Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just doesn't work. It is also a shame as the film has a fantastic opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimately, the production values ​​are too low and the action is just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story deals with an American war plane, filled with gold, money and medals, crashing into a New Zealand lake during World War II. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow sinks ashore, and a drunk (Pleasence) stumbles on it. First, he picks up all purple heart medals and tries to sell them in the city and actually gets $ 75 for them! Little does he know that when he sells them, the local jeweler gets the phone and starts trying to track information about the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his craftsman into the city, and they are trying to force the old guy to abandon the position of the plane as they know there is much more to it than just medals. The old drunk business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then run out to try to claim happiness before the evil ones can get to it. The resulting action is just not as fun as you would hope it would be. The play is pretty terrible, save for Pleasence. George Peppard is trying to make a kind of (I think) austrailian accent, but it's hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not that bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He basically makes his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that says something. Hopefully he made enough money on this movie to straighten his front edges, which looked a little off the ground. I can't remember if he'd been corrected when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the casting is pretty unlikely. Probably most local that never did much else. I think the biggest issues for me were the lack of action for much of the movie and the lack of danger. The bad guys are just too nice and greasy to be taken seriously. And frankly, there are no helicopters in the movie that look like them on the DVD. And none of the boats in the movie have turned on them either. <br /> <br /> However, the film has strengths. The beginning, which starts as a news reaction and becomes part of the story, was a good touch. Brian Mays score sounds a bit too much like that in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds like the one in the big escape! There are some nice helicopter stunts and a big boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men under the film. The landscape, despite the grainy appearance of the image, is still pretty beautiful. The thing you can remember most, however, is the drunk antics of Donald Pleasence. He was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars. The dog.
