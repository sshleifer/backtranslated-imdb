I have never seen the TV series or the previous movies. Probably that was the reason why I didn't enjoy it very much. Drilling and just not fun, sum it up nicely. <br /> <br /> In view of the budget, the film seemed to be embarrassing, because they were unable to do an even-acceptable job. <br /> <br /> We went to the cinema with no exceptions whatsoever and hoping to see some fun movie that would not be for tax purposes. My friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and I spend the next 2 hours hoping it would finally pick up. A hope that died with the final credits.
