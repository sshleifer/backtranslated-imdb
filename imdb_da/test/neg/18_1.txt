Bloody's Birthday opens for a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. Three babies are born at the same time during a total darkening. A caption informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980'. Two teenagers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) come down for business in an open grave. They hear sounds and the Duke is investigating. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is confused and has only the handle of a child's rope, which Annie held as a clue. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody can solve the case of his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of Curtis Taylor's friends (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him. As they are finished, Brody switches from another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel), the three are killed unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident, Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy into an old closet. Timmy manages to escape and tell her sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn't believe him first. The three children continue with their assassination. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg), a beloved couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to suspect Debbie, Curtis and Steven who make her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-olds are really rare killed? <br /> <br /> Contributed and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense aversion to this movie. I think it's horrible and doesn't have a single pleasing aspect to it's 83 minute run time. The script from Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation of the child's motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks Saturn and therefore, for some unusual astrological reasons, these three children have no conscience, so it is the only children ever born during one total eclipse? If that is true, they wait until just before their tenth birthday before they begin their killing. I think it just suddenly kicks in, don't you? For that it is reasonably good, but I still found it incredibly boring and boring to sit through. The movie as a whole is very unexciting and predictable, the kids being revealed as the murderers within the first 10 minutes, and as I have mentioned next, there is no motive. It is also very stupid at times too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The sheriff's death is set down for him who falls down some steps, yes right, the injuries suffered by that kind of accident will not be the same as if you were killed with a baseball cloth as if he were in The reality, any competent doctor or pathologist would have seen it within 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood spilled throughout the movie, and all the bad killings are boring and imaginative. There is something out of place that sees nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys look through a hole while her sister Beverly stripes. There is an early stage just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce goes from the kitchen to the living room, and the boom's mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a bit of all that amazing thing. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. The play is poor all the way through, the three kids are very annoying and got on my nerve right from the start and made sitting through this movie even more of a task, especially Curtis in his geeky oversized glasses. I just hate this movie really, just like that. I can't think of one good thing to say about it. Absolutely one to avoid.
