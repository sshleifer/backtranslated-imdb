When this series aired, I saw most of it. I think it should be a long running series in the way of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk", where the protagonist is being hunted around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case, the hero's problem is his progressive aging in the reverse direction. I liked what I saw of these shows. The action was good especially the sad relationship between the protagonist and his wife. The problem is: They canceled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They never got the chance to catch up with the story either by knowing it was canceled. Poof it was just gone. But as I said before, I could have missed the last episodes. But my proof of the opposite is this: I rented the tape. Where I got off in the series. The main character's wife dies in a fire started by a hunt involving the king's famous organization, the store. As you get away, the hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing that they should go, save him from the store. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die, but escapes the fire with him. Just as he was getting the nerd of the store, he and his wife share a weird moment and phase out existence. Abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to notice one end, not worry about how bad it was. They may as well show some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The exhibition had a cool opening title sequence set for the David Bowie song with the same name
