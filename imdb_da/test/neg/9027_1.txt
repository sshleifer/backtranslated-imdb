Vicente Aranda has made a horrible historical film. It shows the poor cinema resources of the Spanish cinema. In the film, an unreal script shows Juana just like a ninfomaniac facing Felipe, only worried about sex ... but sex with others not with her. The technical errors begin with the wedding ceremony that shows Isabel of Castilla. No one has noticed it? Then, the voice in off seems like a documentary, actors and actress in the movie rarely laugh - take a look at the sequence when Juana comes to the council who wants to keep her isolated - the castles are almost destroyed when at the age of that movie they have been built recently, the crowds are just "four" people, the lights are poorly placed ... Compared to Amelie Poulain, the French movie for the oscars ... it has no sense to talk about a bad movie like Juana la loca.
