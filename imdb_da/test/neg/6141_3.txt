I like the concept of CSI, but the show is spoiled by some serious woodworking. The medical examiner has the best lines and delivers them in a bow, offman way that lives up to the story. Unfortunately, he has a little screen time. <br /> <br /> Why does Jorja Fox always look and feel so unhappy? I know that forensic examination is a very serious business, but the characters mostly seem to confuse seriousness with humorlessness and a complete lack of personality. I can't imagine dancing either Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; What do you want to talk to one about? I wait for the episode when Catherine at the end of a switch picks up a remote control, points it to Grissom, shuts him down and rolls him into a closet until the next day.
