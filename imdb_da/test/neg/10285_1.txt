There is a growing tendency in the media to confuse and ridicule men. You see it in TV ads and program areas. Cheaters are a good example, they could find lots of female cheaters, but the vast majority are men, why? The primary threat to any government's power lies in the male population, they are less likely to observe authority and are more of a physical battle threat. One way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in the community through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are crimes of crime full of self-righteous police, including large-scale aggressive women who accuse all of them questioning to trample their rights and make these men feel scum. In Australia, many top men's sports stars have recently been arrested for questionable assault and drinking charges, another example of the government that manages the male population by arresting their heroes and claiming dominance. Cheaters, apart from the political machinations, are an invasion of privacy and violation of rights, and most of these women attack the men! If it were the reverse, the men would be in prison !! If it were an honest show, they would find women cheaters because they are not usually caught because of the fact that their male lovers are quite happy not to get stuck and get out without rocking the boat. The men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus make the men get caught anyway.
