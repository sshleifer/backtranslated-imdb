Take a bad script, something miserable act and throw a politically incorrect moral story and what do you get? Something to pass for family family viewing. <br /> <br /> Seven Alone is the story of a 19th-century family traveling across America in a lorry and hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and one baby whose sex I am not quite sure of) thus the film's title. The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of heaven. Elder son John is a distinguished teenager, "lazy and good for nothing," as his father constantly reminds him. We look straight out of bats that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties the string to his sleeping sister's hair and connects it to a nearby mule. When the mule has moved of course, the poor girls get out of bed. John is trapped by his father and immediately punished with a strap. <br /> <br /> On the same day, a wagon train goes through. Pa is tempted to participate as it promises a new life in the wild, wild west. Then the family hitches up in their belongings and goes out. <br /> <br /> From the start, the movie is weak and amateurish. The play is under class, as if from one of the films shown in the school about the pioneers. However, I cannot blame the actors because the lines of this film are stupid and just too morally sweet and optimistic. I must tell you that I caught this movie as you flip channels a boring Saturday afternoon at a Christian television station. Not by a religious mind itself, I saw in horror as Seven Alone offered moral statements that were not only obsolete but just offensive! If I were a good Christian, I would hope that I would have had the good sense to complain to the television station to equip such waste. But because I am cynical, non-believer with a wicked sense of humor, I chose to sit back and laugh myself silly. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the father's role as a stern ruler of the house was established when he suggests the idea of ​​going out to Oregon to his wife. Her answer is a heated "Over My Dead Body." We are expected to laugh, presumably, as the film cuts to the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as he steers the cart along the priests. Oh, I suppose even the most reassured feminist must admit that this "father-know-best" attitude was the norm these days, and one could argue for the need for such a dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult but I got somehow this movie supported that notion even today. Nice message comes from a Christian TV station. <br /> <br /> Still, things get worse for the family and the moral integrity of the movie is further diminished. An Indian (or Native American) robs John when he was sleeping in a field. As a common savage, the Indian takes John's clothes and belongings. Fortunately, with the help of the curse Kit Carson, Pa is able to kill the Indian, as well as a couple of his criminal friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a real hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by the carriage's resident physician, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, saying he's an unusually abrupt. Maybe it is, but he is also the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffoon who seems to be able to tie his own shoes, let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg. Fortunately, the young child did not cry when the cart ran over and hit her leg in half because dr. Dutch did not seem to have the right bed linen. We know the disadvantages of constantly belittling a child. Here is a movie that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Later, Pa develops food poisoning, or something I don't pay much attention, and he dies. His deathbed scene is what good acting is made of. Honestly, the man didn't even look sick. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, Ma dies too. The kids are back to do it themselves. And that's when the real adventure begins. Slugging it through the rapids, encountering several Indians (these are fine though) and venturing through snow-covered terrain, make these kids the whole thing. And I was left to think, "What a lot of waste!" Sorry, but there was nothing redeeming about this movie. This little budget little house on prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to 'families' everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975 in the tail of the feminist movement and at a time when the treatment of Indians came into focus, something like this could actually be done. <br /> <br />
