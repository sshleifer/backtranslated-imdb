This delayed effort by Freda plays like a modern (70-year-old) gothic thriller, but gets too little excitement. It is certainly not a terribly bad movie, it is the feeling that many of Freda's later films have by someone who has given up when he has seen the first daily. It starts well enough, almost giallo as in tone, so take a trip to Gothic areas with a decent (albeit horrible clich√©) set up. So suddenly Freda seems to have lost interest in the movie, and all we get is long-lasting shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles. So approx. An hour in the movie we get some kind of violent climax with decent to bad special effects. This is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it is even supposed to be a twist?). And throw a few very half-hearted explanatory scenes along the way and you have a tragic ceremony. Thus it has in its own qualities. But then suddenly stumble and collapse in front of you. Sin. <br /> <br /> Btw stay away from SHAROMA DVD, a useless scary pan & scan edition that kills what can be a good visual experience.
