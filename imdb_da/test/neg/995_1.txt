I think Downey might have been inspired by the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> Who wasn't it? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what he ended up doing here was more like crackhead news. <br /> <br /> Of course, a synapse is a terrible thing to lose, and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no, yes. In more ways than one. Included to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After a while I couldn't carry it and quickly began to forward it. It would have been wiser to have just skipped it completely.
