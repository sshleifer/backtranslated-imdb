I'm not sure why the producers had to act on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests it's a sequel to the first three movies that it is not. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a completely different character (he was eight years older) in this movie. Okay ... so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a movie in themselves. But acting on the HP franchise, I think there could have been some kind of reference (albeit less) to the previous films. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "hoodwinked" - thinking they saw a sequel - not a completely different movie with a known name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley isn't funny and couldn't hold a light on late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the previous movies. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a significant visual diversion ... I have to give this one a lumber down !! Just naming the movie "Down to the Last Minute" would have been ok. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) were not involved in making this film.
