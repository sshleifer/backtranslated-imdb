Blake Edwards' legendary failure begins to seem meaningless after only 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star !, Oh! What a lovely war! And Edwards' Pink Panther movie, Darling Lili never engages the viewer; The air sequences, music tracks, romance, comedy and espionage are all ho hum. This disaster wavers in tone, never decides what it will be, and apparently seems to be a spoof, but it is pathetic and grinding square. Old fashioned in the worst sense, the audience understandably kept away in cuddles. It's terrible. James Garner would have been a major improvement over Hudson, who is only cardboard, and he does not associate with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to have been bribed on the joke and performing with a miscalculation. Blake Edwards' SOB isn't much more than OK, but it's the only good thing ever to come out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili makes only what it is all about, even more difficult to bear. To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans, "$ 24 million worth of movies and no picture".
