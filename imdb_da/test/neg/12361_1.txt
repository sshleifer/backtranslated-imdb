Somehow I really thought I would enjoy this movie because I love mountaineering and a great mystery in the plot. I have to say that the photography was amazing and there were some scary scenes that caught my attention. I thought Nicole Eggert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank You, Good Night," 01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and met some characters who want her to lead them up the mountain. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very convincing strange guy and overthrew many scenes with a bad mood that looked comical. This movie was greatly disappointed and not worth seeing unless there is nothing on the TV to enjoy !!
