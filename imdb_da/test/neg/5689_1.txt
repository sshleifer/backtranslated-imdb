Okay, please believe me when I say this is a horrible, horrible, sci-fi movie. It's done so badly that much of the movie plays out like accidental surrealism and it's definitely a 100% waste of time. Terrible but somehow also deeply unfunny. I saw this as a dual function with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, it doesn't say much. The plot of "battlefield" is so completely unnoticed that it is impossible to follow. The story is cryptic, often obscene, seemingly endless and thoroughly exhausting. Literally half of the movie is duplicative scenes of the female leader, resembling Brian Bosworth, going through the desert. The movie actually starts pretty cool but then nosedives in pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. Quite awful and really an Absurd Endurance Test. Zero stars. --- | Reviews of Flak Magnet
