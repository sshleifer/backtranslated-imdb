Every movie I have PPV'd because Leonard Maltin praised it until heaven has blown lumps! Every one! When will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is a rumbling old bag that doesn't seem to say she is dying of breast cancer to get her! Laura is an insufficient Medusa filled with the Holy Spirit (and her hubby protégé)! Trapped between these harpies, Medusa's dumb-as-a-rock boy has been squeezed into the weeping fatigue of The Old Bag! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily lifted out of my disadvantage when The Old Bag put his head in a sink, but unfortunately she didn't die. I was temporarily lifted out of my suffering again when Medusa was knocked down, but unfortunately she did not die. Torturing the audience like this should be a capital offense! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter kicking him around, Rupert Grint is just a couple of big blue eyes that almost bend out of his sockets. Julie Walters scenery-chewing (especially the stage when she "plays" God) is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least Harold has some bimbo instead of Maude. Because I'm really grateful for that. And if you read this Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
