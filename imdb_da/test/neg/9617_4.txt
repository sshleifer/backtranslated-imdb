I will not waste your time describing the plot for this, the other reviewer did it quite well. However, I will give you my opinion on this movie. This film is basically anti-Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil citizens who have respect for nothing and have very bad martial arts (groups of Japanese men come there who are spared by single women in more than one occasion.) The fact that Japanese warriors lose almost every (if not all) battle in the movie kind of takes away the excitement. The foundation is actually quite solid and perfect for a Kung Fu movie itself. The problem lies in the fact that there is not much fighting. When there are games, some of the games are pretty good, but other scenes are choreographed badly. An angela mao scene takes six Japanese in a church and kicks all their donkeys. The problem is that they show that she is fighting them one by one when they all have to attack at the same time. I collect this movie was incredibly cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same village set when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. However, some scenes are filmed in real places and they look good. Overall, the only real problem with the movie is that it is a slow moving and uninteresting plot. Since there are few fighting scenes, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and I was not entertained. <br /> <br /> one and a half stars out of four
