I thought I could see something good, but ... I'm tired of watching this movie, I don't know what I hated most: the script, the play, the FX or the music. Try to watch the worst Power Rangers episode and will still be kind. I've seen better FX in FPS Games (Touch with the bones or his breath that makes people disappear in a green smoke, is brilliant) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti vest. I liked how the women in the car screamed when the "monster" walked around in the car (though she was looking the wrong way). So give yourself a break and don't look at this thing, at least call someone up to watch a horror movie with you, trust me, you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.
