They said it would be a movie bigger than Turkish fruit. How do they dare <br /> <br /> them? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad play. The only sign I felt sympathetic to was the one <br /> <br /> played by Angela Schijf. Her plays were the best in the whole movie. The story could have been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (light and camera), (<br /> <br /> the opening scene for example), but the bad plays made the magic <br /> <br /> away. <br /> I really don't understand why so many people voted this movie so well <br /> <br /> well.
