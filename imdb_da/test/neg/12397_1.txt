After a meteorite lands in "Boston" (truly a place in the Isle of Man), a fiercely captured alien monster is released and is loose in a local girl's school, causing chaos and making students a zombie-like creature. This movie is apparently a loose (and I loose) remake of the 1986 movie of the same name, as it has the same monster, but another plot. Both films are terrible, but unlike the 1986 version, it was possible to watch. It is not. Let's start with all the problems that happened, especially from the main professor, were very, very bad. This movie will take place in Boston (we know, because the film producers had the brilliant idea of ​​putting "Boston police" or "Boston gas company" on everything), but everyone seems to have quite confused British accents (at least they didn't try to use Boston accents, thank goodness). Scripture is a big mess. The best example of how stupid writing is when it is determined that you can turn zombie students back to humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, they run around instead of shooting the zombie students. On a. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim," clearly does not know how to pace his films. The movie is terribly dull in places. The lighting is awful. The movie looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of remarkable things. 99% of the death scenes involve the being who pops out of a dark corner and pulls someone away while we hear that they are "horrified" screams in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past and certainly does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in the room looked as if it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! The gas tank's "explosion" at the end was just as horrible. Okay, I like to consider myself a just critic so I give credit where credit is due - the creative effect was actually pretty cool. Must love the close-ups of slimy, boiling teeth! <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, "Breeders" is a horrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided as the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
