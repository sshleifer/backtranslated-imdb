I've been reading comments on IMDb for some time now. An 8.3 average for this movie just comes on my nerves. I don't mean to draw one of them "I just signed up for an account so I can write on this movie" bits ..... but I just did. The only theme you want to get away from this movie is that incest doesn't deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that many 'hoity-toity' filmmakers love this movie; Nevertheless, it's bad. What really comes to me is that the director expects you to have sympathy for the "villain" in the movie. If you have sexual relations with your sister, you should be excluded from society. Just my personal feelings, I think. Yet I spent 2 hours of this * exploration * expecting some really deep thoughts behind Dae-Soo's prison. I tend to like many foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean girl and it has put them in the queue in my book. Oh ... I feel better already after a little ventilation.
