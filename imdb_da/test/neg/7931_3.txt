This is another pseudo-intellectual "let's get the Nazis to see really bad" movies. The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt - most already know it. However, it does not necessarily make any movie on the theme good. A Discovery Channel presentation of "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls in line between two categories: documentary and drama. It doesn't cut it like a documentary, the movie is too "staged" and the presentation for "plain". It doesn't cut it like a drama, the characters are too low and conflicts are too easily "resolved". Another thing is the tagline: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was committed just over an hour." When the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching agreement on the final solution. The decision about the solution was already taken by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to make every major stakeholder committed to an already established plan. No decisions or plans were made at the Wannsee Conference. There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). Finally: One thing that the film shows (though not in any particular way) tends to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to conceal from itself that he commits scary atrocities. This is seen in most powermongering 'leaders' and politicians.
