The opening scene keeps me from rating in absolute zero. I want the whole movie to be as greedy and genuine as the intro. To enjoy some movies, much can be forgiven (handguns with 60 shots, with super human powers, all women are beautiful and half naked) but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13" is so far fetched that I am surprised that The throw appeared for another movie day. <br /> <br /> First, how did these guys come to be the police? Based on stupidity, I think. How to justify the main female characters that they are half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or where they are. In fact, no character responds to the elements at all in this movie. No windows, no electricity (which miraculously returns inexplicably) during the storm of the century and they are all comfortable as bugs in a carpet. Which technology exists that disables all cell phones, radios and brain function. This should be the same force that makes Maria Bella go from her handicapped car knee deep in snow without any robe and hardly any dress.
