This pointless movie was a complete disappointment. None of the signs are at least indifferent, so you see what is going on without care. The worst thing was to rent this movie on a gay-owned business to find out that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men involved in many scenes of equal sex and not a single scene of gay sex.
