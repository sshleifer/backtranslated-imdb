This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If I didn't see it for free, I'd never have finished it. The creators of this movie must be ashamed of themselves. It seems that this must be a movie in the way of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a horrible movie, but 10x better than this), but mistakenly failed. The only jokes in this movie seem to be slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst prerequisite for a movie ever. The reason (or lack thereof) is completely retarded. The reason seems to be centered around the coach and his family, but there are so many other things going on in the movie, it's totally ridiculous. Horrible, horrible movie.
