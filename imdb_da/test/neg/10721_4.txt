As a great Jim Carey fan, I took my place in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick and Jane seemed to have all the raw materials to make this second Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humor it seemed that this movie would give, but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming charismatic top VIP employee could suddenly find himself working in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and so to get his head around that this guy has also become a master criminal is almost impossible. The actors also seem confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, rich, eerie head of the operation does not struggle a little to pull out of his one-dimensional character, but for Carey and others around him, the job is much tougher. One minute, Dick is seen as a jolly office project, obsessed with possessions, in the next moment, he is a crushing mess that barely snaps two words together, and eventually he becomes a petty thief who can happily put a gun to second man's head. Jane is just confused with her role, and her character never really gets going. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so good, and it's a shame that this movie hasn't managed to make it work. The odd moment of laughing loud comedy can be found, but it is usually more physical humor than something witty or wise. Carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship, but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaps in his personality. Carey shines when presented with a strong, bold character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura), which this film never presented to him despite his best efforts.
