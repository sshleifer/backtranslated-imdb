I don't normally give a "1" movie. Although I am a HEARTLESS critic, I try to find something that makes the movie worthy (that is, tough). The most important thing I'm looking for is a coherent plot. If it has it alone, I can see it! Let me start by saying it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, it's more like a primary school project ... gone terribly wrong! And I've seen all Sci-Fi movie specialties ever made. <br /> <br /> Many times I have read professional criticism reviews that say crap as "This played like a Made-for-TV ... (etc etc)" and I continued to say "Oh, I wish they would think of a real criticism. "Well that's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that lasted the length of a movie (if I DID consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie all the time) and I've seen every movie Uwe Boll made! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I'd rather see Jaws the Revenge all day so watch it here again ... even 5 minutes of it ... there was a good scene and that was the end! ;-) OK enough, bashing the works in Ron Hall, now for the serious criticism. The script is poorly written, the dialogue is delivered in a wood way, the effects are cheesier than those in a Power Rangers show and doesn't even make me start on the zoom-in transitions screen (ugh). Somebody actually saw this thing, edited it, and then said, "OK let it go"? I'd rather have burned this than let it go! Finally, all I can say is "Goodbye DVD and VHS players have Stop and Eject function!" My advice ... don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you stop and push! :)
