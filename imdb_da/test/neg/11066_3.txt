Monday, October 02, 2006 So I came with my father as I always do. We ordered some Japanese take-out, off lights and pushed games. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. But The Cavern released on DVD in October was definitely a disappointment. It seemed promising to meet all the standard requirements for any horror movie machine: pulled out starting with an antagonistic character, one cannot omit sex scene and the all-too-familiar pre-spook (when they joke you unexpectedly, but it turns out to be idiotic) Kompis). So finally, when it came down to the nitty gritty, I was ready for some real gore actions. The director I admit was keen on. Of course, you have to fill a whole 81 minutes with people driving back and forth in a room about 10 meters wide. It all begins when some college bound "cavers" gather for another cave dive. They all look like spicy pros, very serious and spiritual about the whole cave's experience. This time they bring a new city together, some annoying photographers for the blind of his National Geographic cover to understand the full dangers of hole diving. When they come down deep into what they call "Hell Pit," they quickly realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I will politely leave any spoilers if you are naive enough not to take my advice into account and avoid wasting your time. Although the atmosphere and background music were spooky; And there was probably a lot of blood and gore, as the moment was nearing witness to actual degradation, it was more like watching porn without the full frontal. The camera's work was purposefully dark and outlined. I guess the director used it for effect. I suppose what I like most about the movie were the moving characters. They deserved the Acadamy Awards for those who touch bickering scenes. I almost scolded a tear when they finally "got it" ... A tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn, and you hated Braveheart. Then it's the right movie for your next Saturday night.
