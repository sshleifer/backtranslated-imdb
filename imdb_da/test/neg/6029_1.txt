This is the worst war movie I have ever seen, possibly the worst ever made. I find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10. It has a fantastic lack of even rudimentary traces of realism. Almost all war movie clich√©s appear in this movie and are badly done. On the other hand, I would not have seen it to the end if it hadn't been so remarkably bad that it amused me.
