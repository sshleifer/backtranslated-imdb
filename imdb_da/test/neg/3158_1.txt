Barney teaches children nothing !!! Here are some 3 reasons why you shouldn't let the kids see this show: 1. Barney teaches children that we should think about, like each other getting together. <br /> <br /> 2. Barney teaches children that you should not be sorry and if you feel sorry, you eat plenty of ice cream !!! 3. If you get people to shame you, they will give you what you want when you want it. <br /> <br /> Barney is just a fat doll that told kids strangers are your friends. He should NOT be trusted. And he is tall every day !!!, he constantly GIGGLES !!!! DO NOT SEE THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!! Your children will thank you when there are older people
