My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 on blockbuster. If I had known how horrible this movie was, I wouldn't have paid a cent. I had no warning for this bs. The action cannot even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel totally uncomfortable doing so, and the male villain ... god who could not tell he would attack emily And the musical characters ... my Lord. This movie makes me cry. Never rent this. In fact, if you happen to look at it, you must track your eyes. This movie is not of God - it's from hell. I just have to take the last few lines to write blah blah blah shiz because I really don't want to continue this review.
