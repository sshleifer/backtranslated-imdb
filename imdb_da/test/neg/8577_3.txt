This is a stereotypical plot. A young giant tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not chosen to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school, and he obviously finds a strange new master to teach him to fight. The fighting is not of high standards. They are too "simple" in a way that 1 + 1 is simple for each adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kick. The coach shouts doing this and does it without success. And after a little more of this ridiculous blow, he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the struggle, even though our hero has had a blow in his life until that time. Think of the Rocky movies and you will have a good reference for how much he beats. The fighting is also badly shot. <br /> <br /> The final thing that screws this movie up is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really could have made good quality entertainment, but the director wasn't up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don't know, but it does mean in the end that this movie is poor and deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
