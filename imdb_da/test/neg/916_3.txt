Why did I buy this movie on DVD? The short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it almost seems like I really like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this. Now does Tatyana Ali make a really good effort in this movie? I have to say that this is one of the better ones and she forms a pretty decent actress. I look very much forward to seeing her in action when better material will be available. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie was horrible - and my score is based on this: 1 star not to be the worst movie I've seen, 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali, and 1 star not to think it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse movies for it. <br /> <br /> Yes Rule must stick to rapping, not my favorite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there, I would be happy not to see him pollute the acting scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man. Just because Michael Caine is a fierce brilliant actor who has been in so many terrible flicks and good, you don't have to copy him Wing. The rest of the semi big names in the cast: It's ok, there are bills to be paid, and we all have to do things we are not proud of time for others. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It is so massively defective, it is quite difficult to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes thrown together, just as the director said, "we must tell this and we must tell it". There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising over or inside it. At least, the plot changes in history were far too obvious, and it was therefore predictable what would happen all the time. <br /> <br /> In summary, one word: Reallynotgood
