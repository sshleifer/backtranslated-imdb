Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this unless you are a clueless naiive 16 year old girl with no sense of reality and nothing better to do. Sad characters, bad action (artificial feeling), weak history, slow pace and most importantly for this movie lacking existence - no one cares about it too dramatic.
