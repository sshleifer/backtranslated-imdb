This movie has got so much in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; everyone pictured abundantly .. without a single word stated !!! And how come it sucks so bad? This movie will make you reconsider the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, you would rather defy Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis together. You can't bear to see this even with your brain shut down. And now you think, "I have to see this." I warned you. I assume no responsibility whatsoever if you regret spending within an hour, staring at this work of art. Well, I warned you. This must be forgotten and buried forever.
