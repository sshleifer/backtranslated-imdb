Irwin Allen puts all his talents behind this: he is the writer, producer and director of this cartoon-like "epic" of an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation surrounding the earth. Potentially exciting history fails to emerge, despite an eclectic cast. Various players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly mixed and give a touch of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few failing laughs, but Allen did not know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. Later on a popular TV series. ** from ****
