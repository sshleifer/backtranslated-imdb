Malice behind you was created for a particular purpose in mind to push the author's instructions on who should either go on water or who should dance with the devil. Unfortunately, it seems that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it completely away from the power, feeding their points to the viewer. The way its message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I have heard of the Spanish Inquisition! From a true Christian to another, Avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when you try to send this kind of message! <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, the choice of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists, so they must be Muslims). The principle of this was good, the story gave a great channel to its message, but it was the performance of those ideas that became short, making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger to say. <br /> <br /> You would be better off smearing your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr Swayze better to receive this message. at least, the film did not try to push itself into the throat. Or if you like good Christian movies with a strong message, try "End of the Spear"
