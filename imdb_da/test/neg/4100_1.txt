This is a pitiful movie. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. Don't expect an explanation of the plot. There is no. It could work if there was something of interest or sign we could break about. There is no. Everything that happens to a person is as predictable as the other movie Sci Fi channel does. <br /> <br /> Don't understand what some of the characters say. They talk gibberish, especially the annoying lead woman whose accent is a kind of British that is harder to understand than any old British movie you might have seen. She's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of money on some great sets and scenery, and it's the biggest crime in this movie because it's just not worth it.
