Yikes. <br /> <br /> I've seen really few bad movies in my days, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the others from MST3k. That was also the case with this one, and even though I found the movie itself quite fun, it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the MST3k comment. The film is an excellent example of really bad movies coming out of Europe in the eighties. Terrible music, horrible plays, horrible plot (how small there is), horrible dialogue and really, really, really, awful editing. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This can be called a turkey if it was not for the fact that it is not unique in any way whatsoever. It's pretty much the same kind of movie that almost every Italian hack from an instructor is angled. <br /> <br /> Try the MST3k version. It's a pretty fun episode with Mike and gang in pretty good shape.
