Before I speak my piece, I'd like to make a few things clear: 1) I am a chicken that is not in chickens ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone like you" are EXTRA exceptions - Hugh Jackman's ass). 2) I only chose this one because I am a Fichtner fangirl who was looking forward to seeing him in a bathtub. 3) I'm not a Demi fan, although I think her performances in "Immortal" and "A few Good Men" were sublime and have earned seats in my library - also I think she is a little crazy (no way is she NOT still sleeping w / Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is a character study by an unfulfilled woman who lives twice the life of independence and happiness, then I say we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: Literary Agent. Make 6th salary. Living in an upscale Manhattan penthouse. Easy for her to read hundreds of manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly recommended nightly escapism. Or maybe through an interdiems portal? She has a career, the look, a cool car, a big pillow, where is the man and the kids now? In step, our boy is Aaron - a true escapism. What are architects? They are artists who can make maths, dreamers who earn real money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of safety and fills a cavity where she obviously does not have confidence. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin there is Marie who still lives out of her schoolgirl fantasies while she is through motherhood. Her children are her career and life. But what about Marie, does she exist only through her children? In rollers William, a Parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with: herself. <br /> <br /> A suspected journey of self-discovery and late an old age thrown in some with anxiety and some anger with Marty / Mary's own mother. This gets a 3/10. All I could say is God to the BPL multimedia department, I wouldn't waste my $ 2.99 on Blockbuster on this, put it in the direction of a Harlequin Blaze title.
