My parents used to rent many horror movies when I was a kid. We loved seeing them themselves as they were bad, they made some enjoyment. This was such a movie, a bit difficult to review as I only saw it once as a child, but it's not something I want to track again so I can make a more in-depth review. The story has some old horror actor playful dying. I seem to remember he was acting a bit like an over-top Vincent Price without being sympathetic and stylish. He commits murder and dies, but what is this? Is the movie already over? No, for some reason, some children snag the body and are prepared for a fun night to be killed by ham from beyond the grave. I remember that the murders were nothing special after the first couple, and I remember this movie was quite disappointing. Seemed to have a good premise, but only managed to deliver the goods when more cool kills were needed and the super horror actor needed to add a little to his repertoire.
