Cheaply made, badly acted and unimaginatively directed, Flight to Mars is still entertaining, even though it has gone against it. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three elderly gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as news watchman and a female scientist / apparent love), "manned" the ship. The spaceship comes there and finds that very human Martians live there and have technological advances that would make the Earth blush. But everything is not rosy in Martian's underground cities (here shown as some caves and a few rooms). The Martians are a dying planet, and a faction wants the landlords to just turn the ship off at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on Earth, and another faction wants to talk peace and see if they can't persuade the Earth to to give them living space. The special effects here are rather paralyzed even for 50 sci-fi standards complete with slow rocket ship, pastel / neon foreign cloth, where the women wear shorts that would make many blushes (except of course the men) and slightly less offered. Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is gracious if nothing else. ite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts, but adds little play. The rest of the casting is filled with some older sci-fi veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum who perform serviceable jobs. This is not a premier sci-fi movie from the golden age of any standard, but it is highly visible and fast-paced zippers.
