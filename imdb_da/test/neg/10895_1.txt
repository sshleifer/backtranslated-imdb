This movie has to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a movie. The action is horrific, the excitement builds up minimally, and the overall plot is ridiculous. I found myself blushing for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim because of course she had to be pulled out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will be immediately disgusted in the jumps we are asked to make in logic, and the so-called exciting structure would be fortunate to get a 3-year-old to be mildly concerned. I am dissatisfied that a sequel is planned because it means they will ask us to quit some par plot again. If this is an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I will avoid any future movie of them.
