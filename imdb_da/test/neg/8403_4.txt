A disturbing film as it does, with an intimate intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son, but in his confused structure it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesia. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two strands, of which weaker is the gradual revelation of Graham / Pablo's state. Around this is a beautiful description of his condition and his meandering path toward partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene. <br /> <br /> The case is the strong thread, while the specifications of the plot are borne by an apparently tacked on the collection of characters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his state in a clunking flashback, his manipulative boss and his cartoon mad scientist psychologist: Everyone has an interest in keeping him lost and dependent. <br /> <br /> The film's failure lies in the conflict between the two threads. One is visual, wobbly and sublime, while the other is structured as an unfortunate thriller, all display dialogues, and the patterns of unresolved symbolism. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Novo. It continues to flirt with the abyss and shadow of the taboo in something beautiful, as in the quarry, with the bassist and the two women, when a set-up for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still don't get tooth. <br /> <br /> Odd, lumpy and a narrative error, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
