If you see the documentary extra, you will notice that the director is completely inexperienced and was actually a colleague of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is making a favor for his old knob, despite the fact that the knob is becoming quite talented. Was it hard? Now watch this movie and you will realize it is not. Too slow in the beginning, too obscene in the middle and too slow to end. It sums it up. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only two who showed some charisma. And Kemp actually did an OK performance. But the rest was really bad. An example of stupidity was suddenly when "chief robber" accidentally left his mask during raids. So what happens? Well the other robbers decide they can also remove their too! What a great thought. The violence was merciless and insane. But not in a "cool" way. Rather in a farcical way. I wondered if it was supposed to be a comedy. More fooled Tarantino for having his good name associated with this waste. More fool me to see it.
