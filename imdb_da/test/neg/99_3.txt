Four things fascinated me about this movie - firstly, the Stars Carly Pope (of "Popular" fame) is always a pleasure to see. Secdonly, it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Third, it is recorded in collaboration with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. But I was totally disappointed. The whole story is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. Pave's plays are fine, but Owen is unfortunately underused. The other actors and actresses are okay, but I'm not familiar with them all. Apart from the good puzzles filled with the whole movie (and pope and owen), this movie is not very good. So the history of history is ... don't see it unless you really want to.
