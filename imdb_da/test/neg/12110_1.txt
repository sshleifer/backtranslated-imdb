The director of this movie is a famous French television presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is in his image. It is the story of a young late person called "Zep" (sic). One night he sees his sister's SM sexual relationship and decides to do the same: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is in an asylum and his unfortunate girlfriend in a clinic. A man will find them. A man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like a hell angel. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With an excessive use of clich√©s, we can see how absolute love can break all misconceptions, and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with the rapist. We also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien believe he can do better than a century of psychiatry, but he also imposes a stupid, left-wing ideology; with the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss who will remove the weak of his girl. Appalling. But it is very pleasant to laugh at Zep (mentally delayed people are not funny, except in this movie.)
