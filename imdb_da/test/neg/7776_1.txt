Terrible horrible movie for television. Once again, Lifetime delivers us the predictable triangle; skeming bitchy woman out to be stupid ignorant wife of yet another silly man who has no clue. <br /> <br /> I get antsy when I watch these movies. You may ask why do I see them? I don't have a clue. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can't get away from it. I'm waiting for the bitch to make her come up pence. And I'm usually not happy with how she gets her desserts only. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe in our vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic and how to do it? Without blood tests, DNA, inquiries and recommendations. She continues to kill real estate agent Gabrielle Rose, who is on her in broad daylight on the front of a house for sale, and no one sees her? She kills her mother Susan Hogan, and you can predict this conviction when her mother mentally mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her wallet. Guess what? I will not continue with this. <br /> <br /> Finally, you are back in the house alone with wife and bitch. Good luck, but too slow. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is sufficient in the role and looks a little too disheveled and obvious. Tori Stavning is just about to look blank out of time. She has the big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the man who walks around and assures his wife that there is nothing for him and his ex-boyfriend, even though he is discovered all over the city, is very chummy with her and stands half-naked with her in his house, when he sent wife to town to stay overnight. Still, he continues to deny the romance. Life never disappoints viewers with their evil plot and stories of women and their stupid husbands. Wish I could give this chestnut a "0" rating.
