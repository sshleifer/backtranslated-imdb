A party hardy frat boy's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang and sends the young man to a sudden psychotic rage. He and his friends compress half of the city to bring his sister back to life. <br /> <br /> A year after this film, SAVAGE STREETS was more entertaining. Linnea Quigley, who has a costarring role in this movie as the sexy (and short naked) girlfriend of one of the boys, also has starring in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This movie is subpar, although it provides enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to satisfy their audience. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
