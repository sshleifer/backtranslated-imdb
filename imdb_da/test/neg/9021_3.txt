What distinguishes some of the 'Lone Star' films (and many others in Western and early thirties adventure films) was their lack of what we recognize as formal historical narrative. To be sure that they had good against evil (the basic element of any western), boy meets girl and some stock characters like the old ranches and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter, and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman, but the act that was played was often different from movie to movie. <br /> <br /> "The Lawless Frontier" contains Earl Dwire in his great star swing (not) as (for an inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, a half Apache, half American pose as a Mexican who speaks the language fluently. 'His biggest bags like a Mexican seemed to be his scandalous mariachi clothes. The only plot seems to be stealing Ruby, the grandson "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). When she meets her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long overview that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. You think that because the opening scene shows that Zanti kills John (Wayne) Tobin's father without a camera, it would play a greater role in the movie. It doesn't. Too much hunting back and forth between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> We get many good stunts from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby on his horse as he drives past, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them out of their horses, a horse leaping out of a cut in a lake, and even the same light down the lock chain, which was in "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body surfing train instead of a wood forest, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time Also, as they are in a desert. The highlight is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodical, well-photographed ride over the desert after the refugee and stumbling Zanti with the amazing basalt rocks of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless series, westerns and science fiction 'moon' films) framed behind him. No final gun duel at fifty times with the heroine running from the bar's tree steps to embracing and kissing the victorious hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a watering hole and dies. After a few too many chase sequences, Zantai's gang is finally caught in Dusty's cabin, which comes one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked by being dynamized. No riding out in the sunset or mandatory to kiss the girl: The final shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the phone now Sheriff John Tobin, "What did Sheriff Tobin like for dinner?" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, pacing is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause it to pull, and the horse's hunts fill the film. Despite the various and unusual elements, it emerges as one of the weaker Lone Stars.
