You have to watch this movie! It's so bad it's actually good. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy but gutsy captain, who of course has an affair with his worn out, used to be a beautiful copilot. And of course, the mid-air collision occurs when the captain's enemy rivals to ride. You've got your ex Vietnam Vet, which can't cope with the pressure of another mid-air collision and crash landing. Then you have your old crazy Army Air Corp buddy flying the chase plane and trying to well I can't tell you what he's trying to do. The plane continues up and down, and then you have your greedy and immoral business engineer, and then you've got your Ice Station Zebra cold and then Lucky saves the bad guy from drowing so they can land the plane! And it doesn't end - it just goes on and off! You have to see this. It is well! YOU MUST BE KIDDING! CAREFULLY DISPLAYED IT ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND HOW IT WAS NEVER SHOWED ON CABLE.
