So lamb is not even fun. A zombie infection surpasses a small university campus and a government battle of secret operators backs up a few scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak. Collecting zombie DNA damn is not easy. Once you've been bitten, you're one of them. The whole university has been completely infected by the round amok undead. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not even solve the horrible original HOUSE OF THE DEAD (2003). Sensual entertainment, however, has been achieved. A few glimpses of female nudity added to a gaggle gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy. Credited Members: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The F-word holds together a imaginative script.
