If I were still 5, I might find it scary. It's (I guess) a low budget movie. The action is not good, but it can be worse - the film and the special effect are terrible. The story is thin and not worth staying at. Too much time is spent on boring shouting scenes. Chases or fight with foreigners, remind me of the kids fighting with scary masks. Some gore with blood and body parts - would scare a 5 year old child I guess. It is far from reaching anything like the movie Tremors. It turns out to be an "incident" and we see alien ships near the ground. It makes you doubt if anyone will make a successor ...
