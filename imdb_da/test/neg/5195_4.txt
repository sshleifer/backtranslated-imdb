Had I known what I filed myself, I would have fled the theater. The movie is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. Despite striking images, exciting sites and a topic that could have been fascinating, the movie is dead. I was not aware of this period of Greek history and willing to experience a great movie. The filmmakers' hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a train pass by; we shall see it from afar, we shall see that car by car, we shall see the smoke, we must see it slowly, and we must see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, the characters he creates are never developed, they never change. They are so stereotypical that we wonder, are they supposed to be Everyman? Every Girl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any point in this allegory? It's the most pretentious movie I've seen for a long time.
