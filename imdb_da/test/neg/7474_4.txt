... A recommendation! Gloria Grahame runs the kind of orphanage where the discipline is given with a meat cleavage, orphans hang on meat hooks to punish them, and the bodies are kept in the freezing so that they can be brought out when social services call. We know that the orphanage is attached to cash, because Gloria puts all orphans to work, and also because there seems to be not enough clothes to go around - especially for the older nubile orphans (the age group seems to be 12-30 ish ). The new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a battle for Gloria - and has actually just taken out his own mother and mother's beloved (in a witty claw hammer and fire-opening opening scene). Predictably, Gloria ends up on a meat hook itself. This was made around tuppence, but was / is a big big hit on the grindhouse circuit. My DVD cover promised "disturbing and politically wrong scenes" and certainly did not succeed. I think it is considered as Citizen Kane by the orphanage, which is a torture film. 4.10
