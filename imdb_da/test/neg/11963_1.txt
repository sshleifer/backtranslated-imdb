So I and my friend are moving our local movie rental shop and looking for something to pick up for the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; This is, scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we both looked at the first two Scarecrows, so we felt obliged to finish the job. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First, we notice a picture of Ken Shamrock ("The World's Most Dangerous Man") on the cover. Apparently, he was accustomed to marketing the film as "lead actor". That way, he has the smallest screen time for any member of the credited class. Next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very gently covered woman in the middle of the cover. I can assure you she is not in the movie .... at all. At the time of renting, we assumed that this was repeating the fact that scarecrow was "wild". In the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out to sea. I can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie ... at all. Looking back at me and my friend should have known that something was up. I really mean who the heck puts a carnival on an island. Now on to the current movie. We start when a young man is inexplicably merged into a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. Don't ask me how they were melted, but remember when Brandon Lee wakes up from the dead in The Crow. It's just stupid. But in bird's defense he is "lost". Anyhow, scarecrow who now lives vicariously through the young man takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who had made him wrong. Because yes, in The Scarecrow's world, beaches are conveniently located in the same general proximity as cornfields. To make a long story short, scarecrow kills all who stand in their way without warning except the scarecrow's trademark whistle, which signals a slash. However, this is quite impossible to believe because the costume mouth of the bird throat is clearly sewn closed. More clues that would make Kubrick roll in his grave later and we have one of the worst third tranches in a series ever. Well except perhaps the third matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is wildly bad."
