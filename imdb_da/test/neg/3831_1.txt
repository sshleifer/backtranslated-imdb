I attended the premiere last night. The movie started with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, so most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep. This movie cannot be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of the guest's work unless you want to say _Sons of Provo_ is a will-be away terribly wrong. It just fell flat, it died, it was painful. The story went nowhere, the jokes were gentle, even though you were a Mormon and could get all the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby's acting was spot on! And the songs were very clever (only for an LDS audience). So my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you are Mormon, buy the music CD.
