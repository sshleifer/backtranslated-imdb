This movie was total cheese. It smelled. The only good thing about it was the actor. Other than that, nothing remarkable at all. <br /> <br /> Big Time Spoilers are coming up! Don't read if you haven't seen it! <br /> <br /> This movie is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been crushed by their younger son, and later as they find out older son has been melted by their day care providers. Although they are liars in court, and the defense lawyer is a real dot, the jury finds them guilty and condemns them. <br /> Finally, I can only say to the director: "Next time you want to make a movie like this, do it differently".
