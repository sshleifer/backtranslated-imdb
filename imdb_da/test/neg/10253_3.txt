I easily admit that I see a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of are as bad as when women had tails. It is a stink of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen who discovers a woman for the first time is instead a dull and lifeless affair without having a single laugh. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is fun, you can find a laugh or two. The boys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art. And there's just not enough of a plot to keep things together. It seems to be on and off again. <br /> <br /> You might ask yourself, "If it's as bad as you say, why didn't you rate it lower than a 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the film is not without its curiosity. I find a bit of interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I want to give When Women Had Tails a point for its historical "value". The other two points are for the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not much of an explanation or justification for a rating, but what should you do? That's the best I can come up with.
