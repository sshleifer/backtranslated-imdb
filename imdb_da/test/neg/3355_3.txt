I really tried, but this movie just didn't work for me. The action scenes were boring, the actor was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were too stereotypical to even be funny. Pam Grier tries, but when you have nothing to work with, her significant talent cannot prevent a catastrophe. Even with the standards of this weak genre, this movie is pretty bad.
