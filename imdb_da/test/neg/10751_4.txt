The low-budget murder mystery of a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder man had been convicted for 12 years earlier. Complicating things is the fact that he freed custody after his conviction, but PD believes that the man is innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just goes along with some excitement, and despite some good character players in the cast, the performances are generally under par. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more at home to make Western - he knocked out Gene Auty's TV series in Columbia around this time - but even though he had tried to inject some liveliness into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his attempts. Average at best, climaxes with a juristic scene that is straight out of an episode of "Perry Mason" and is just as predictable.
