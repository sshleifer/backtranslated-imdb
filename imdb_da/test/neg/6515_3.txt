My Age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, solve a series of killings where the victims were crucified. Since Cole has arrived, he notes that the killings have changed a little, and thinks there is another killer. It gets personal when his former wife gets murdered, and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell examines the mysterious Cole and finds out about a very shady past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I enjoy action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not so funny to look at, incredibly stupid, and of course, Steven Seagal's performance is extremely angry. However, Keenen Ivory Wayans is not too bad. The only redeeming thing in this movie is the occasional good action scene, although most people come around because of insane stupid reasons. The reason for this movie is absolutely gibberish. I didn't care about it at all. The whole "mica man" past of the Seagal character was stupid, all the Mafia battles and battles in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. Give this movie a cheek. Australian classification: MA 15+: High level violence. Rating: 35 out of 100 (rather generous)
