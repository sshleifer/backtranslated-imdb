I watched this movie as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I attended was part of a widespread community to present God and Christianity to our society (Hartford, USA). I was one of the counselors who helped participants (who were invited to come up and do whatever kind of religious profession they wanted ... and follow up on them after the movie. As such, it did what it was supposed to do and I found It was personally a medium to strengthen my faith in God, and I also found it very useful for those I counseled, especially Kim Darby's work in this movie, and the parents (Wintons?) were somehow overdrawn. ... no one says to their child if they think he or she can be the parents of an illegitimate child something that Wintons did "oh no no, not thaaat." That is not exactly what they said, but the sympathetic audience , I saw, had a laugh at what it was they said, and also on the son's aftermath: "No, MOm, not me." Don Berghuis
