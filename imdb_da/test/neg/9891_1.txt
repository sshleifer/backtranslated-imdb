This junk bar looked very similar to the novel as a pickle slice makes for a cucumber. The filmmakers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to approve this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13-day glory collection of poppycock. I almost started smoking for the Mexicans, just to get the horrible thing to end. And what was the scene where Stacey Keach tried to get James Bowie to let him look at the knife? The sexual innards he used were young and unnecessary. They could have used the movie they wasted on the stupidity to put into a real dialogue. This show was an embarrassment to Hollywood. Or can the clowns become embarrassed?
