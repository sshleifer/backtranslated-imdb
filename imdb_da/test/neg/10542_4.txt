Oh God! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed with it. I thought .... A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We can even see him having a stick with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> But I was in for a rude awakening. This movie can be summed up as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. So get a pen writer / instructor even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and who is too big a fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Throw in a lot of people with really poor ability to act and who doesn't have real names. Finally, add a star star that gets saggy around the midfield and doesn't seem to be able to make its own stunts anymore. <br /> <br /> The result? Half Past Dead. An action movie so ridiculous that at least it made me smile right through. The plotting holes are stupendously, sharply large - for example, prisoners who, when the prison is invaded, fight the attackers rather than attempt to escape. Or how about the prison itself, which has an arsenal that contains heavy machine guns and rocket-driven grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (which has a striking resemblance to a Huey) with a kind of video game machine mounted in the nose. <br /> <br /> There is Seagal itself. I like the guy. He can fight He is even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But the whole movie I kept hoping for on one big, defining battle scene. It never happened. Instead, we got people to shoot guns a lot and didn't hit a whole lot. I think that when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub machine on them, there aren't many places where the bullets can go over the corridor and into the goal. But somehow they miss? Even the A-team would cringe this stupidity. And then when we get to any kind of physical thing, we are treated to a shabby Matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet time. People are kicked twenty meters through the air and various other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> Come on, Steven, you're better than this. Your career cannot be over. Don't say so! <br /> <br /> This is immediately forgettable (except I force myself to remember for this review) and if you see it, try to find it entertaining in an A-Team kind of way. But I doubt it will be high on everyone's "re-watchable" list. Without justice, this is not the case. More like out for lunch.
