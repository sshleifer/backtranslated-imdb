I told a friend about my time when my grandfather actually chose this horrible piece of shit for us to see a night at the theater. He never chose another again! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that her father did some writing for this waste. I thought she was funny. It turns out she was serious. She had never seen it, and she said it put a quick stop to her father's writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But if she actually knocked it down and looked at it, she would see within the knot why it ended her father's days as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, this bushel is badly beyond the description. I mean, Joe Frazier, who's terribly tucked away? And why in the world would two police officers care about a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with the tongue hanging out? What is it about? Nothing about this makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this shot not only ended his father's writing career but ended up career for everyone involved. Or at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this waste of a movie. Let's just say I will always ridicule my friend to reveal to me that her father was an author of this movie! It alone should tell just how bad it is!
