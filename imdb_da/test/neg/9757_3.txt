Teenage Exorcist is one of the God-fearing movies for video that makes the viewer give up with expectations for decent entertainment for small breasts sexual antics, youth humor and empty writing. This movie delivers exactly what it tried to deliver. It's about a girl moving into a house where a baron they said (hmmm) once lived and finally was drawn to him through his own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law with an Irish priest, her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy, are trying to save her and practice her demon. Well, not much in the way of horror or excitement. In fact, a line from the movie basically sums up what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her up (the name is Diane by the way, and she is played by Brinke Stevens) after trying to chain her sister. He removes a gag from his mouth and says something like, "This won't be the last gag we'll see tonight." It wasn't actually. The special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film uses this by playing on its comic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are fun. Robert Quarry, old Count Yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an Irish priest. He pours it up with biblical verses and curls Irish songs. You know you're in trouble, but when Eddie Deezen gets top billing. Deezen does his schtick and also has a few good moments, but the material is just too intriguing than being anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman, from The Hills Have Eyes, also has a short but interesting cameo in the movie. As for the other thespians, they are all quite good at being rather mediocre. Stevens are lovely in fishnet stockings and French-cut panties, but besides that don't expect too much from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and she shows a little more than Brinke (a very nice young lady by the way) and out Brinke works by miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be fun in the midst of mediocrity. Again, not a bad movie to waste some time involving no thinking. If you are a Robert Quarry fan, at least you should see it for his performance.
