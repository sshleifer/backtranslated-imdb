Now I notice that IMDB has not offered any plot information ... this is because it is not possible to do it without sound dizzying and disgusting ... because that is what this movie is ... WANT AND VALID !! I saw it because I am a humongous fan of Chris Noth, whom I have met personally, and he is a good guy ... but if I ever meet him again, I have no trouble asking him what made him to steal in something so terrible. He plays a former kid's walk, which is now a brilliant doctor who spends his free time driving over young children with his car, in order to limit them and pamper them ... this is not a "spoiler" because all this is done very clear from the beginning ... disease enough ?? Oh, it gets better ... he's manipulated to do this by his incarnate sister who threatens to keep sexual favors from him if their last victim doesn't die ... even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so scary. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
