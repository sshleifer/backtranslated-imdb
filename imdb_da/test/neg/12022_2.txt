I come out to fight here because this film was so well shot and so well thrown that I am twice as angry with its development than I would have had with a minor work. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can only say that part of my 2 VHS set was an unpleasant, elusive joy of bizarre but plausible plot developments. The protagonist was suitably naive-like, but also intelligent and very very open. The events that he is quickly forced to express are the separation of his parents, the culture shock, when his Pakistani roots collide with a complete breakdown of the English-speaking society in the sixties, his father's dubious transformation into the reverent Buddha of Suburbia, and turning his cousin into a feminist militant as his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the budding punk movement of the 70s. Among other. What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work that every actor started to create and establish their characters in the first part, only to make everything turn into very bad porno episodes in the second part, too many justify plot development, and too explicitly even seem erotic. My biggest pet error is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie, and this was a great example to me. I felt a bit like I was invited to a party of very clever, funny strangers, only to have the doors locked and the guests not allowed to interact, and we all forced to see bad 70's sex exploitation movies instead. What an insult to the amazing actors' hard work! Why not just make a cheeseball flick to begin with? And why throw a big lead character that can actually work and then cut away from him when he builds up to a good performance? I almost felt as though he was still getting tired of the endless sex scenes where everything he did was lying there pumping the pelvis for another pustular naked actress. Bottom line - First part is smaller genius, part Two is second tier soap opera perversion. I know that the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these fine actors were exploited in real life when their characters were in the movie, and that made me pretty angry and very uncomfortable. Only John Waters can draw such a questionable breakdown of actors and plot and make it artistic. My suggestion is only to see the first part, throw the other into the proverbial rubbish, and you will love the Buddha forever. Results A + F = 0
