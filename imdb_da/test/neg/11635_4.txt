1. watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced, frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's animation group plays much like television cartoons and leaves much to be desired in the likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikely villains. I'm not even sure why the kids want this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids have little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box compares it to Disney's efforts like Aladdin and Lion King. Don't let this fool you - there's no comparison in history or quality.
