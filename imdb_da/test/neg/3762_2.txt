I bought the "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a two-pack of "Destination Moon." Now I see why the distributors did it: No one who had ever seen this movie would buy it alone. <br /> <br /> I can't understand which school system appeared through the reviewer who claimed that RXM is "great in its predictions of how space travel would take place ..." Start right up and then make one 90 degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach flight speed ... I don't think I remember it from the Apollo program. Remember that astronauts must be weightless when they close the engines, gravity changes directions each time they pass through the hatch to the engine room. Going to the moon, but "missed" it? No problem, it's just a jump-spring-and-a-jump (with a helping hand from divine providence) and you're coming to Mars! And okay, if you want to put life on Mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, was it a forgiving convention for the storytelling sake, but can you make them see at least one little alien? These Martians looked like extras from the cast "10,000 B.C." I can accept some scientific errors, but it would not pass patterns with an above-average second degree. <br /> <br /> And it is apart from the screaming plot holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you are reminded of constantly by the fierce PA voice saying "X minus so many minutes") the astronauts give a press conference! I suppose the time crunch is, why Dr. Eckstrom does not change his coat and tie before launching into the room. And how convenient it was, though they planned to go to the moon and put pressure on it, they took walks (and rifles!) Just in case they ended up on Mars. They are lucky they landed anywhere, as the method they had developed for landing seemed to have Dr.E look out the window and tell "pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) to adjust the dampers every now and then. Note to the designers of XM-2: what about giving the pilot a window seat? <br /> <br /> Dino's previous comments on the relaxed sexism that had the eye-candy Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) judges them all by repeatedly turning up their fuel calculations, but hey it was the early 50s. She was there to fill her sweater, not a useful feature. "Rocketship XM" is known to be one of the first of the first movies to say "ohmigod we all want to blow us up with these A-bombs", but you can notice it without wasting 77 minutes to see such a drunk. By the way, the message could have had a little more influence if there had been some money in the budget for actual sets of city city ruins instead of just dull paintings. <br /> <br /> I appreciate "good" bad sci-fi, for the unique way the "future" used to look, and for the inherent (if discouraging) humor you can find when we see back to the audience's naivety 60 years ago, but this film must have been insulting even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not even suitable for a MST3K-style lampooning. Sometimes bad is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> Anyone want to buy a DVD? Used only once, I swear.
