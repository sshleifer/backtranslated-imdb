Market for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences than it does with focusing on its characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Over the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal image gives the idea: anyone who opposes him should look like a fool; the bad are just there to make him look good. Seagal had continuously built up an audience that seemed slightly larger than those following chuck norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Market for Death, Seagal throws any style and head full throttle for exploitation. This movie contains lots of graphic violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than please rowdy moviegoers who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those just leaning on the excitement without rhyme or reason. And he deserves some genuine guilt for this drop-out taste as a producer of "Market for Death." Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who comes home to Chicago, where his family is attacked by a Jamaican street gang attacking his sister's house, and the movie shows that it is not rare when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris) is shot at the junction. Hatcher gets angry and he decides to stick with his old friend Max, Keith David, a school gym teacher and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican politician. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hatcher declares war On the top bad guy called a horrible Jamaican voodoo priest Screw flat (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous assault". <br /> <br /> And it's almost unbelievable in the way Seagal chooses different members of the band: He seizes a guy's eye, he breaks a guy's back, and he breaks many arms and limbs. <br /> All logic for this movie is thrown into the window - through the glass, that is. Why isn't Hatcher and friends accused of all the property damage they cause or the body counts that pile up? And how did they get their automatic weapon cache from Illinois to Jamaica by plane without being discovered? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him, which fans apparently seemed to enjoy, and despite the three different characters he played in so many movies, each dressing in oriental black bathrobes and wearing a ponytail. One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's movies is that the protagonists never seem to be in serious danger, and because he is the star, one can obviously not put a glove on him, except the bad guy. br /> <br /> Seagals heroes are all interchangeable, like most of the plot lines and action sequences. Whether he masks like a ship's cook, a firefighter or a L.A. Cop wearing love balls, Seagal is always Seagal, which is exactly what his fans want. In fact, the context of these movies is that if I wanted, I could take an old review, change the names and have a fairly accurate recording of the new movie. Not that I would ever do it ...
