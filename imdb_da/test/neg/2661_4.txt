Exceptionally cold and silly drama by director Sydney Pollack. Soapy plot revolves around incredible couples disappearing into a plane wreck, leaving their spouses to find each other and connecting at their own intimate level. Romanesque novel writing gets sluggish, though I thought the performances of managers Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were fine. Slick production is of interest, although the plot still covers the same reason and never builds any emotional momentum. As a result, the climax of the airport is a great "so what?"
