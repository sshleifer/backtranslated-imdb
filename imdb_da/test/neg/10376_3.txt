Formula for max. Neither title reflects the actual content of the series, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco" (actually Iverson Ranch). The reason is just to fill the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistical meetings' in 15 chapters. It's at least three chapters! Apart from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accent Frenchman, seeing how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or burst, what this series is really about. When the main characters begin to fight, you can bet that everything in the room will also be in it. So kudos to the battle choreographer, who is the real star in this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive notes: the characters sometimes lose their hats during the fighting, and best of all, we have girls' side scoops (often a journalist as she is here) who actually participate in the chaos, mainly by shooting and Kill the evil ones. However, Linda Stirling will kill the biggest villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there are just too many jumps out of the way - before the disc falls before the car crosses the rock before the speedboats explode before the building explodes before the truck hits you, etc. . <br /> <br /> It is claimed that this series partially inspired "George Lucas" to make the first Indiana Jones movie, but it is more to implied concept than due to the actual story or series development. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. Apart from seeing all the furniture being smashed, there is nothing really going on here compared to other series that have fewer matches, more history, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 for all the furniture smashes.
