I really enjoy this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever been unlucky enough to see. While about 25 percent of my audience walked in and out of the theater while viewing (or completely back), I was stupid enough to hold it out. The main issues with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of movie you have to do two things ... one, give fear of the killer (that they take him 20 minutes in the movie that is gone) And you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (girl in thought) enough character development that you actually care about whether they come to her in time or not. I didn't just lose the girl, I got so little insight into her that she was only a blurred face, and when I remembered that she was part of the story, I really didn't care what happened to her. While the pictures were interesting in an LSD flashback kind of way, they often made no sense, and it should be a lesson that images cannot compensate for missing a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally, someone knows or cares What was with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.
