I usually love teen / high school genre flicks, but this movie really lacked originality. The only prerequisite for this movie is that four friends cheat their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship. There's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep viewers aware of the full length of the movie. The act is not that bad, even though the actors do not really have much to work with, as the dialogue is tripe and clich√© '. After watching this movie, one has to wonder how a producer could come across a project like on earth this and think, "I'm going to make this movie." No wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
