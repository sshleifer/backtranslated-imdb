Corey Haim plays a child holding up a dog to take a giant troll and OSA hit-man (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (Which player plausible considering Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend also in this clear but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is horrible, of course, but the film's sheer momentum as well as Ironside's impressive presence make this at least a modest movie. Still, the plot is ridiculous, and it would have been nicer if we could have seen a monster or at least more gore. In any case, it is somewhat different. It is also quite likely that this movie will be the last teenager movie for some time to show a teenager making tube bombs. Matt Bronson 2/5
