This is almost Ed Wood territory. Yes, the ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist. And the sound effect fright makes fingernails across a whiteboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw, when the ugly critter gobbles his victims with a mechanical jaw. We get great close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but no more. I think the producers thought that a more appropriate title Big Mouth could suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And talking about comedies, all that "anti-material" gobbledy-gook is more fun than anything in a Lewis movie. I suppose the scripts were fixed because of why an ordinary devil could not take care of a fugitive threat from the 1950s, so they fought a true whopper - anti-material from another galaxy. Yup, this refugee from KFC should have flown in from another galaxy behind a screen of anti-matter as explained in scary details of one of the movie's resident geniuses. In this case, Jeff Morrow is a pilot I am collecting in his off-hours, advising Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Morrow also keeps the ridiculous procedure out of the bad movie Hall of Shame as he actually delivers his lines with a straight face. In addition, he even sounds like he believes in them. This is a cinematic triumph of the first order. To judge by the Oscar, Morrow deserves a battle medal to perform above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme bad movie conditions. See leading lady Corday, then you can measure his strength under fire. She looks like she just wakes up in a bad dream, and maybe if she stands still, no one will notice her. I almost did not. Oh yes, the first time I saw this run-in disaster was through a rowdy in the back row of what is now a housing development. I should have learned my lesson and broken another 12-pack this second time.
