I used to think that "It came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I had seen showing horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. Of course I had not seen this beauty yet. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Terror in the Aisles"? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) It is assumed that most of the amazing moments of shock-cinema history began in the 1970s when directors like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma came together. And which bones are thrown to the true classics (ie the black and white movies) such as "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Wolf Man" appear either with Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello along with or not at all! <br /> <br /> 2) The clips are most often as short and out of place of originals, they just give an instant shock to the viewer, and for those who are not familiar with these movies, it will not be at all some sense, the moment the shark jumps out of the water at Roy Scheider in "Jaws", much to the effect of a singing song. In the original context it had power.) <br /> <br /> 3) Do we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience that reminds us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the violence in horror movies "are unfortunately against women"? Then is it an indictment against the filmmakers to add the scenes or movie walks into the theaters and see the same kind of feed again and again? Sorry, it's a whole lot of worms open for a more deserved movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most importantly, why is the movie so short? It is not as if there were not enough of these movies to use. If they had just opened their resources and used ALL available movies, they might have had a "That's Entertainment!" - style films that would have been relatively more entertaining. Heck, and even pull Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing lived then, remember you) and better yet, even though Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I bet! What a cheers that would have gotten from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we are left with is a tedious little flick pretending to pay tribute to these movies, but all it does is leave the viewer felt cheated for less than 90 minutes as they might have gone and looked at a real movie. Don't make me wrong; It was good to see which clips they showed, but if they could have done more with the items! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea left "in the hallways".
