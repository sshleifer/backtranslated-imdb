Alright! A sci-fi / horror / action B hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the last scenes we get to see a cyborg with a deflash metal head killing more people! As with any Wynorski flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't go anywhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a two-film-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama / thriller part (as it opens the movie) with Carol Everything kills her incredibly annoying and ungrateful man (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). And on the other hand, we got the "escaped cyborg on a rampage" part, the "Night of the Living Dead" style. With Carol and Cyborg they are trapped inside the house and a bunch of special OPs / bounty hunters play the role of the zombies trying to break into the house. Needless to say, this flick is not up there with the biggest. Zach Galligan (of "Gremlins" fame) is particularly painful bad, and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting roller) is again completely wasted on this film. Wynorski even released one of his own films here, as I am 99% sure he used some stock footage of his former film "976 EVIL II" (the exploding truck and motorcycle scene). Yes, it is not so good and fun. This only applies to Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them if you didn't already know it.
