This was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concessions are that we did not pay to watch it at the cinema when we rented it on DVD from the video store. Simply - No plot worth mentioning (I've only seen it 5 minutes ago and already I forgot), annoying characters played badly by two-bit actors, and if it was a comedy, I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we shot each other, we agreed that it was really terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite quite pathetic and I warn others not to waste their time. A travesty of the national Lampoon name, Rating 0/10.
