This little cheapy is only remarkable because it is the worst movie Abbott and Costello ever made. It's horrible in every way: curvy music, horrid choreography (check out the outrageous lead male dancer), cheesy special effects and sets, wood actors (the leaders are hardly in high school in their profession and were unheard of later) and a script without a single laugh . Better times were ahead of the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is much preferred, as did the TV series, which was sometimes inspired. But skip this one.
