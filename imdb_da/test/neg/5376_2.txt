I suppose I have to be fair and point out that I don't believe in ghosts. That said, I'm very interested in the subject, and I enjoy a scary story just as much as the next guy. I'm a fan of Ghost Hunters because they at least try to give their studies a scientific angle. Even early episodes of Most Haunted had a camp's entertainment factor for them. Paranormal state has none of these properties. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality TV" these days, it suffers from overproduction, bad actors and stupid scripts. The performers of the show freely admit that the writers "guide" the stories. I hear that they themselves go to shoe horns in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. The view also has many other errors. As others have said, the story quickly becomes nails on a blackboard. Over the top visuals and sound effects quickly become just as annoying. I am willing to suspend any disbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" history arc is just ridiculous. As the producers of this show are also responsible for brain-death foods such as MTV's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I suppose this really is no surprise. If you are a die hard fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a great "reality" show junkie, I think you will find much to suffer in Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend you avoid.
