This movie would have been okay, in fact, excellent if the directors would have left interviews and concert recording separate. "In the Void" is a good song, and I hate how cut it is on the best side to go for a mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. It should have been at the end of the movie or placed in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to set and and just let play because the music is continuously interrupted. Nevertheless, there are a few forces for this film; The concert recording, when it plays, is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the scene after a long break without Osbourne, and this movie captures so well: The Sabbath basically rocks the fans. The fans, of course, have a nice advantage in the movie because they themselves see the band live of course, but they also do not have to stop with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are charged with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) to make this the movie! Also shame on Wyatt Smith to edit the movie in such a way.
