I watched this movie on videotape with my younger brother long ago, despite being a young boy with impaired hearing. I didn't have the closed image decoder at the time (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what's going on. It was not my fault I saw the animated movie for girls. My father rented the video to show to my other younger sister. <br/> <br /> A decade later and I rented the video (for 50 cents) to look again with the closed caption on. My memories of this movie were completely destroyed by none other than a WRETCHED SCRIPT. I have seen lots of badly written movies (like COOL AS ICE and JASON GO TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY), but I have never seen (or heard) the dialogues so badly, only overwhelmed with enough inanimate to make your head shine from laughing in hysteria and screaming from the pain by keeping the torture from sitting through this movie. Despite the good plot and exciting history concepts, the script must be one of the worst ever written for display, not carried! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a writer, professional or otherwise. I can't believe they would even allow the horrible script to produce a movie like this in the first place. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in broken English or translated, before they know what they were in? Even crap as G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The movie has redeeming values ​​in relation to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of 80's animation or just taking a nostalgia tour, be aware of RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR stealing! It doesn't matter if you were elated or traumatized by the haunting animated movie with a horribly written script, or you haven't seen the movie, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. The movie should be watched with the precautions to learn how NOT to write a bad script!
