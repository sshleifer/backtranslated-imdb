I totally agree. This is "Pitch Black underground" and a well-worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers who explored the caves, went through impossible underground passages, some of which were heartwarming. The scenery was amazing. Had they dispensed with the "Alien" toothy CGI badboys pin, the movie would have been much better. All they would have done is never show any monsters at all, but everyone wonders and follows Jack's lineage in madness, and it could have been a top-rate hitchcock-style thriller, perhaps awarding material. The action is not bad. But the rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare.
