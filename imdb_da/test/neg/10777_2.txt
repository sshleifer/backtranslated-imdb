The title, although unique, will undoubtedly remind true horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freak and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. However, I can assure you that this "thing" has nothing to do with "Freaks" or even with the art of professional filmmaking in general. This movie was recommended to me, probably because it is raw, disturbing and thought-provoking despite the low budget production values. Yeah right?? The person who recommended it to me can now consider himself my personal enemy! The low budget factor is correct, but it is about the sum. "Freak" is terribly slow, poorly made, and any sign introduced is even unbearable, and it also includes the freak. Two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who fled from the trolley to another hospital and headed back to the house where he killed his mother for 9 years. This could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated movie venues but instead Tyler Sharpe decided to make it boring and meaningless family drama. The leading actress is trying to look emotionally corrupted, is quite ridiculous, and the total lack of excitement and action can hardly be due to the limited budget. Overall mistake!
