I have recently seen a number of caving films and this film managed to link all the worst aspects of this kind of movie. You get very little appreciation for caving surrounds or the monster they face while the characters are klich√©d (spiritual guy, leading with tragedy in recent times, etc.) And the end was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director continued to shake the camera or show almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I've read that this movie gave a real cave display and yes, I imagine the caves are dark. Showing almost total blackness for half the movie really brought it home. I really enjoyed the "descent", which for my money had better plays, showed more tight caving situations, better monsters and had a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <The monster turns out to be a guy whose plane crashed and the parents were killed and left him growing up in the caves. He seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why is it never corrected - perhaps the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this, but under the film, when someone is killed, you get the impression of something big with claws who tears up for each victim (see how much blood bursts the walls!) But in the end, it's just a guy with a coat pulled over him and a mask? I would be willing to overlook this if great heights of tension were achieved, but that was hardly the case. Then he begins to rape the last remaining bullets and roll credits ... Almost absurdly I thought. Sometimes a movie is so bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but these movies fail to take care of themselves as well. <br /> <br /> You saw it, you can't watch it!
