"Stick Around" is one of the short series of movies that paired Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy, before Hardy's immortal unity with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - the helpless little man and the indulgent big man - were prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that is simply not true. Ray and Hardy play well together but are really not a team; In each of these films, Ray has more footage and is clearly supposed to be the hero, while Hardy somehow bullies him much in contrast to his later "Ollie" character's "Stanley" treatment. It is very clear that the relationship between little Bobby and Big Babe was inspired by former Chaplin movies, where Little Tramp was bullied by huge Mack Swain or burly Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> But in "Stick Around", Hardy sports a bowler hat identical to his later "Ollie" titles (though he has a full-bodied mustache) and he and Bobby - after using most of this movie as opponents - ends up as full comrades. <br /> <p> Bobby is a paper maker for Matz and Blatz, with Hardy as his boss. When the delayed Bobby tries to suffer, he immediately realized that there is a smart physical business between the two men reminding me of a routine done by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in 'The Garage'. A little later, Bobby Ray - whose short acting career never made a sharp persona - performed an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel when he pulled a long ladder from a much smaller set of tools. /> <br /> The paper hangers go to work in a sanitarium and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: A resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he is a poached egg! There are also some howling racist (and tastefully scary) gags that involve a black man who rightly allows the inmates to break open walnuts on his head. When he sees a * picture * of a lion - not even a photograph, imagine - he mistakenly goes as if it were a real game. "Stick Around" is pretty gloomy. Most of the pantomime and play is much wider than it should be for a slapstick comedy; Even Hardy, who is already a very subtle actor in 1925, sticks badly to his over here. There are several bad examples of shot matching. I was impressed by an unusual camera setup when a fat pedestrian face is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his real face. SPOILERS COMING. During their short mating, Hardy typically played Ray's boss or opponent or both; Here once they end up as friends. It's a nice ending, but it doesn't matter what really is a bad movie. My rating for this is only 4 out of 10.
