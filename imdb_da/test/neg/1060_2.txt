My Caddy Limo was ruined !!! Well, I had one like the - Drove hoi polloi and many of the selectors in Manhattan about a couple of years. <br /> <br /> It was much more entertaining than this movie I can tell you. Lordy, what a bomb - like in RPG go boom. I also ran many more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role as a red-nosed circus clown. If he couldn't take it seriously, why would his audience? The director should have kicked his ass out of the set in the first hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written by 10 years old for 8 years old. Surprised that there were not a lot more cracks on the sets. Oh yes, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - you have to take the bad to get to the good.
