Just to save you money and time, I will go on and tell you that this movie is definitely not the battle and gas it would take to burn it. Do not waste your time. As a matter of fact, you would be better off forgetting that you had ever thought of seeing it. I've seriously seen better B movies in a language I can't understand. Who ever allowed to be done must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say to this movie is that with a new script and the right instructor and actors it can be a good story. Let me break it down; A virgin becomes pregnant by a demon, the baby, while she wants to feed on humans within her womb. They are trying to compensate for this being perhaps the worst movie ever made with curse and meaningless nudity. All in all, totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it.
