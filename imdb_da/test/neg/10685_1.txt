I was permanently scared by this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The main movie in the movie is nothing special. It seems that there is a tribe of snake-growing people in a remote mountain area in northern China, where women, instead of men, are leaders and decision makers. I think among some men this is enough to make "Succubare" a horror movie. Whether sometimes Chinese men will walk into the village, take a fancy to the local girls, seduce them and then leave them. Unfortunately for the men, the women had put them under a syllable derived from snake venom, which would cause them to die mortally for 100 days - their pods swelled like a pregnant woman with live worms and snakes - if they did not return. <br /> <br /> Forget the face of the US video. This has nothing to do with vampires, even though there is an unfortunate blood-drinking scene. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb that means "to lie", and it is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep. In fact, they are the men who are the seducers here. <br /> <br /> But this is not the main effect of this ridiculous movie that is so inappropriate. These are the small side events. I will overlook the slaughter and slaughterhouse of a bull that is carried on the screen. The participants seem very experienced as if it is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life; and I'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards ... though I don't like having the action pressed in my face as "entertainment". What I want I could overlook (or HAD overlooked) is numerous, completely foreign shots from an unidentified man who occasionally interrupts history by eating live animals. He starts the movie by tearing a living snake with his teeth. During the film he devours a bug, a lizard, a lane (I had to leave the room after that) and a whole mouse (I stopped watching at this time and lost my appetite for days). Let me emphasize that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie ... unless it is a cynical reference to love as it is portrayed in the movie: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism that tears each other from the helpless. .. but then again I'm probably just rationalizing to get the villeness out of my head ...
