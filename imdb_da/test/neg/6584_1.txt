Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I Love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Hit Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THIS MOVIE TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous and said this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper gives it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Eber's written review gave it a full four star! Wow ... OK ... I must see that! But wait ... the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not that interested in seeing this anymore. <br /> <br /> "You came now?" says the train manager to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on the course without him. The boy changes quickly and jumps aboard just in time. <br /> <br /> Now, most of you have probably decided not to board the train and wait for the TV Train or Rental Express (hey, I'm so witty and clever). I was, on the other hand, like the boy who was first skeptical, but jumped on to see what it was all about. <br /> <br /> I just wasted $ 10 and two hours in my life. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit through it's not even fun. There is no history. There is no salary. You sit there through these series of events and you wonder, "Is there anything for all this?" It would be one thing if the scenes were entertaining ... but they are not. <br /> <br /> This movie is void of any feeling, every soul, ounce of plausibility and most of all: any fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the way these characters look after a second. Saying it's the same technology (motion, sorry, "PERFORMANCE" capture) used to make Gollum is a shame because Gollum was trustworthy !!! Photo realism does not translate well into this medium. You use animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not just film it all with real actors? They could certainly have. We, as humans, know too well how we go, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen made unconvincingly is not impressive. Caricatures made convincing are the more credible that The Incredibles has shown. The result of the Polar Express is now as if they took dead bodies and made them dolls. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where's the soul? That's what we see on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> There is a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from his seat because she stands up and leaves it. He will give it to her, but you sit there and go "why ??!" Just let it go .. she's coming back! Of course, he loses the ticket and "adventure" follows. And then there's a boy stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids? And then there is this annoying "know all" child with the voice of a 35 year old. It's so much worrying. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are songs! A girl enters the train where the lonely child is. He sings a song to himself. And then she interrupts and enters! They finish the song as they hold hands and look into each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very awkward. I don't even want to go into details about the song serving hot chocolate, while waiters dance around the train. "Keep it warm, keep it warm!" One scene where Tom Hanks slips on his knees with his arms stretched out in the air must be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I'll just kill myself. I need to see something wild to clean the palette. Yes ... crappy is better than The Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The one thing about trains, no matter where you go, what matters is deciding to move on." <br /> <br /> Not on this one. For God's love, I have decided you! This is just another movie taken from a children's book stretching incredibly thin in film form. It happened with Grinch and The Cat in Hat, and they were also horrible. But who can blame them? I don't know if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Junk Food, and turned it into a feature film, it would probably be pretty boring. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, which is what The Polar Express is so lacking in.
