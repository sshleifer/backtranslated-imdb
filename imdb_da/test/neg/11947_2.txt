How bad idea was to rebuild an almost Oscar-worthy movie? MOSTHLY MARTHA is much better, has depth, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and horror with the beautiful Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous effort by Hollywood. There are more and more remakes, and the movies are full of arrangements. Is there no one who can create a good and new script? Or is it a security solution for making remake or movies from the proven cartoon characters? The films become much less interesting today. Oh yes: If you want to see a really good movie, see the original one. It is definitely worth it.
