I watched this movie with a friend who ran with me a marathon and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating and didn't even break the idea of ​​what a training plan would look like, so non-marathons could have An idea of ​​what it would take for them to train and drive one. In fact, there was almost no technical information. I did not expect this to be a technologically heavy instructional video, but since that information was near zero, the film was just not balanced and was not very useful for non-marathons considering their first run. <br /> <br /> There were other issues. Some of the very first pictures were people coinciding near death while trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. The time was also difficult to follow because it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good track on what time you were watching. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury and you just assume that it is from her entire training, but then several scenes later separate you because it is because she stumbled over a fireball in her yard. <br /> <br /> Some parts were very good, though, as if a woman bullied race officials who wanted to run to be men alone, and coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runners portray earlier was vying for the first place. <br /> <br /> From the top of my head I think of other chronological documentaries, such as Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and you want to tell you everything you wanted to know. /> In short, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon movie, and as it stands I cannot recommend it to non-marathons to educate and motivate them to try one because I don't think It will have that effect
