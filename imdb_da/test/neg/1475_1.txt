This was a horrible, boring movie, even for a documentary. At times it provided insight into life and also had humorous moments, but in general it was not worth seeing. Every time I began to feel sympathetic to Mark and began to hope he would be successful, I would be disappointed with his lack of responsibility and substance abuse.
