I seem to be in the minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty horrible. It seemed to contain almost all clich√©s in these types of "heartwarming" films. <br /> <br /> The motive of the characters who fell in love with Radio was never really explained. We just had to accept that everyone was happy with radio except for a few bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost all the great moments in history from 100 yards away. When the film wanted you to go "Awww" or pull your tissue, I rolled my eyes and wished I saw "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> There was some good performance by the player. Too bad they didn't get a better movie that wanted to be shown.
