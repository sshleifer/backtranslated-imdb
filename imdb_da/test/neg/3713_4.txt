I love Juan Piquer-Simón! He is my absolute favorite movie director and throughout his career, he tried incompetently to deposit on just any successful contemporary development in the horror and fantasy genre. After the big hit that was "Superman", JP made his own and hilarious "Supersonic Man", he picked up on the fierce slasher movie frenzy with the crazy "Pieces" and he really outdone with "Return of ET" unofficial and rather scary sequel to Spielberg's SF blockbuster. "The Rift" is of course inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster films such as "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six". From start to finish you can entertain yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless rip-offs of these (and other) classics. When a brand new and fancy type of submarine disappears near the deep Dannekin rift, another mission is sent with the U-boat designer Wick Hayes aboard to investigate what has really happened to Siren One. In the dark of the sea, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cave where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures. The monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members ... "The Rift" is a forgettable movie, but it still has some brilliant yet? although very risky ?? monster models. Fans of blood and gore will not complain, even as the beastly attacks are rather cruel and ruthless. The action is very wood, although many of the throwing names can certainly do better. It is advisable that you just enjoy the clichés and gory effects in "The Rift" because if you start thinking about the manuscript, you will find that it doesn't make sense.
