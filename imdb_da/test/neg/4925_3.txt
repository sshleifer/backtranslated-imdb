This show shows the depths that UK TV pre-water drama has sunk. With these dull scripts, mediocre actions, bad plots, horrible dialogue, one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to watch excellent hospital drama. None of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act! <br /> <br /> If you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style TV, this is the show for you. Personally, I like something with more meat on my leg. Unfortunately, I fund this dross as with all other UK licensors.
