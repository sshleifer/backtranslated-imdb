Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper", transplantes Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into the modern, criminal underworld Melbourne, Australia. The result is a half-horrible piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is neither horrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the cast that exudes any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and misdirected. Shot on HD by late Will Gibson, the film's visual lacks character. Everything is too clean and consciously informed. Wright's direction is uninspired, and the action sequences are confusing and unobtrusive. Marked erroneously as "the most violent Australian movie ever", the movie is violent at times and reasonably bloody, but it does not give a single instantaneous moment. Slowly moving and terribly pretentious, this swinging silver screen version of the classic game is the personification of the wrong head.
