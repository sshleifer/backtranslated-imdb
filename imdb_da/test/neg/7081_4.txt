As a documentary, this is ridiculous in a campy sort of way - a sklyky collection of recreated biblical tabloids mingled with solemn interviews of so-called "experts". Think of it as an infommercial that pushes Jesus instead of thighs. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior similar scenes in such widescreen Hollywood extravaganzas as "Ben-Hur", "Kings of Kings" and "The Greatest Story Ever Customs." Instead of dragging the entire cross to Golgotha, for example, John Rubinstein simply wears his cross-brace attached over his shoulders to his outstretched arms. Nails are not run through his palms, but instead through his wrists. His feet are not sought separately, but one is placed above the other, so only a nail is needed. Incidentally, Rubinstein's fluttering before his crucifixion is in the book, "Lash! Of course, Rubinstein and the two twenty modest loincloths, which are probably not true of the shameful reality of Roman crucifixions, carry supplements. Incredibly, the "good" thief is placed on the left hand of Jesus, who goes against a long tradition. However, just why this thief is played by a pudgy, overweight man is a mystery, especially considering that the "bad" thief is something of a "hunk".
