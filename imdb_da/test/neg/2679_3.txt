The 90's were really a terrible decade for movies. The films are lacking in a good style, and the storytelling is often lacking. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry into the long-running Halloween series is definitely a bad one. You just never really get into the story because it is not a very well built and built film. It is simply a badly made movie that also suffers from its imaginative writing and non-compelling characters in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just to be in it. It's a shame that this should be Donald Pleasence's last movie role. It's nice and also a kind of suiting that his last role is in a Halloween movie, but he certainly deserves to be in a better one. <br /> <br /> There is never a real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers just never crosses as threatening or scary. Perhaps it is because he has highlighted too prominently throughout the film, from early on. He does his usual things again, but without too much class or originality. Also, the attempt to uncover Myer's past does not work very well, for the main reason why it just is not explained very well. It is obvious that the script went through various rewrites before - and also very possibly during the recording. Several scenes were even resumed or added after the first rock proved to be far from comfortable. <br /> <br /> The movie looks more often and feels like one made for television. This is also due to the lack of some really good things. As a scary movie, it is essentially missing everything to make this a good or even original to see. <br /> <br /> So far the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
