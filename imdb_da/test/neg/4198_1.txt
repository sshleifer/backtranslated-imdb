I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on-the-box type thrill ride. Scarecrows also freak me out. The movie had an effective title order, but it followed, was rather paralyzed (flat, poor lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently, I noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a rather extensive ad campaign. I thought maybe the first was marginally successful, so they gave up ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and eg from the killer scarecrows. Well, there's no scare in the video ... Not a problem. The problems start in DH 2 with a title sequence that resembles an unfinished concept of weird shapes and bars that wipe away titles and what not. As for the actual photography ... every time the sun shines in a shot, you would have all those blown out white, confirming that you see an ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterns filmed on his Onkler farm. The action didn't work at all. The cheap rip-off of The Shining twin girls was under freshman movie student standards. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was smashing and chopped. (For example - every time the editor would cut a new shot, here you would change the perspective of sound). It's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera into a grain field for three days, put a light on it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, attached the recordings in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, thrown into some music, bypassed some imaginative sound work or mix, burned it directly to the DVD and threw it on the video store shelf. Any horror fan must be offended by this type directly for video work that is void of any skill or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get some of a picture on tape does not mean that it should be published to the public. If I could give this a rating lower than one, I would.
