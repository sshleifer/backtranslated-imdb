I suppose Hollywood in 1997 was not quite able to openly celebrate homosexuality, so you might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together to show some courage. You simply want the credit to be given them to have put together a really good movie, and in my opinion "In & Out" is not qualified for this counter. It's the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a small city high school English teacher who, on the eve of his wedding, is out of a former student who happens to win an Oscar, and who then has to review what can only is described as a period of self-discovery when he is gay. For me, the first problem with this movie was. Howard should not really be gay. The movie would have been more fun (and perhaps even more thought-provoking) if Brackett was amazingly alive despite the stereotypical homosexual aspects of his life and the city's belief after Oscar's speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought to identify him as gay when these stereotypes were present could actually have been quite offensive to gay communities as well as to equal men who like poetry and believe in dressing up nicely!) <br /> <br /> Kline was decent enough in the role, and largely carried the movie. Apart from him, most of the other cast members (though fine actors) were not really aware of their success on the big screen. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are great actors, but not big movie stars. I actually thought that the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was the supermodel Sonya played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her stereotypical model line "I promised to do that photography this afternoon. have to crumble and vomit! ") In the end, what really struck me off with this movie was the ridiculous ending, beginning with the graduation ceremony (and, to be honest, though someone decided that the ending was really necessary, the movie should be finished there, rather than continue with the completely unnecessary fragments at the end.) <br /> <br /> Basically, I got a few chuckles out of this but no more. 3.10
