Although some pretty good Rick Baker-esque special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role, this right lame Italian movie deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks, while most Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have moved on to television films. In terms of plankton, half Piranha - half the thing, with people turning to monsters, rapes women and causes general chaos. The ultra-ugly, sleazy and over-sexy feeling of the movie makes it hard to enjoy. Only available in Italian workflows that float around.
