The worst part of all is the bad scripting that leads to superficial action. <br /> <br /> The Dreyfuss character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter's character is excessively self-centered, and Hunter commends himself in severe assault as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was wood. John Goodman has done the best. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the whole death / ghostness has since been a little exaggerated, and now it seems to be quite lame. <br /> <br /> Only to see if you like old planes.
