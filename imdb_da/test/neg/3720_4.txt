Dark and gentle Edward G. Robinson (like Wilbert Winkle) decides to finish his bank job and do whatever he wants, opening a "fix-it" store behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married, but childless; He has befriended local orphanages resident Ted Donaldson (like Barry). Young Donaldson is an avid workshop assistant and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's insidious wife Ruth Warwick (like Amy) is dissatisfied with Robinson's job choices and puts together to return to her idea of ​​normality. Their lives are further disturbed when Robinson is drafted. The war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story, like Robinson's character struggle against a dominant, unsympathetic wife. Possibly, filmmakers show how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. Robinson and Donaldson are a good team. Robert Mitchum has an inauspicious bit part. The end "trick" played by Ms Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged.
