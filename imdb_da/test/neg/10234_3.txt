Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to see! While none of the other reviews mentioned this, the public domain version I was so seriously flawless. The sound track was off with approx. 10 seconds - which means that the dialogue and action never came close to the match. So you would hear something that happens well before you see it - a very confusing suggestion! The worst is where you hear a gunshot, and only later is the guy hit and dropped to his death in a taxi. <br /> <br /> Although this severely destroyed the movie, it also concentrated on the dialogue easier - and showed the serious flaws of it too. The dialogue was simply awful - often delivered with almost no bending or feeling. As a review said, it was like looking at high school. Part of this is understandable as the sound was a new medium, but this movie's dialogue was poor even compared to other 1929 movies - really bad. And like many of these early sound films, the movie was just for talky - with sappy and too melodramatic language and just not much action. And you would think with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action !! However, it is really a juicy romance - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The movie finds Carol Lombard across an alcoholic. She ends up stealing to try to take care of him - and the villain Robert Armstrong comes to her. When Armstrong catches her cheating card, he covers her and then helps the drunken brother to get on the foot - and of course he falls for her in the process. The problem is that when the drunk sobs up, he will also have Lombard and she has to choose between them. Wow ... a restored drunk or a mobster ... talking about a few good leads! Overall, it is a little difficult to assess considering the miserable print I saw. But even if you ignore this, the movie has many problems because of its poor use of dialogue and excessive talky nature. And ... it was juicy to start.
