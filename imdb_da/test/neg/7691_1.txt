This piece of crap is not worth critically reviewing so I will write some information to those who do not know the background of this movie. First of all, it's not the first Saudi movie they used this wrong information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Second, they did it for money, not for anything else, so they picked Jerk (Hesham) who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother) it's a popular show, and Jerk Hesham is popular but stupid, cheesy & untalented picked then the famous Kuwaiti actor Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid and untalented) but has a popular one (count how many times I use the word "popular" and send me an email to get your prize.) Has a popular show and the Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan, who appeared in the POPular cartoon show CBM (unfunny) so she is famous * PoPular! Then they chose some Saudi actors for blah blah blah blah. The most fun thing is the director! He is Canadian with Palestinian roots (I think the movie's identity is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! The screen shot was written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very horrible!) With the help of Lebanese critic (known as a critic, but actually he is a fundraiser!). This group of multi breeds (money slaves) don't know anything about the Saudi culture they do not represent, but when we know who is behind this waste, all our issues are relieved! Waleed bin Talaal is the Saudi Prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about the Saudi culture or the Saudi people, he himself does not live in Saudi Arabia (although he lives, he will live in his own world, his world is far far away from the real world, people's world), so he doesn't know anything or cares about anything but raising his endless wealth. <br /> <br /> * Not Saudi movie (no movie). <br /> <br /> Turn them all off. <br /> <br /> Pick out 10!
