This was one of the most favorite, boring and clich√© movies I've ever seen ... and yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor. Even those like Gina McKee couldn't make their way out of the terrible dialogue. It has been described as 'art house', it can only be a euphemism for boring, horrible and quite honestly, artificial. Why is it that when a movie lacks a plot, critics believe it deserves to be called art? But far more confusing, why did America love it? Without you, this film had remained on the shelf where it might belong.
