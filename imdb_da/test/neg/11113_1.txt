Just been to sci-fi channel UK, July 5, it was ****. Shame on JRD! Maybe he was bored for a week! He can't shine after LOTR. I suppose he shouldn't blame. Sir. Sheppird was I turned off after 50 minutes, couldn't carry it. The Cgi ship was bad and the creature resembled a large 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? I think the whole thing should have cost $ 250. Avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the DVD if they release one, I can't imagine they would spend dollars on producing one. Let's hope someone does a decent Chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was okay, poor Lance. It's a shame a great studio and straight away won't risk it, no more superhero movie, thanks!
