On the plus side, this contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, especially worried about Himmler, SS and their research department. It also has some good piano music, some interesting recordings and some good cameras. <br /> <br /> But this is a very poor piece of historical work. It has no clear goal for it, and the whole matter can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler established a branch in the SS to investigate the origin of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all sorts of places ... (none of these roads were explored, the results were not shown, and the arguments were hardly rejected). They wanted to see that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same thing through historical evidence. They didn't find any. The members of this research group were senior professors, members of the SS and thus associated with the Holocaust and were seen as OK after the war and continued to lead German institutes. <br /> <br /> These facts are intriguing in themselves, but they are never explored deeply, and no coherent argument appears in the program, which either condemns or liberates them. This also does not seem to be the goal of the program, the purpose of the program is unclear, it jumps from subject to topic. The witnesses, although presented as trustworthy, are few and not supported. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program doesn't know where it goes or why and fails to impress. The topics are fascinating, but this program tries to take on a large research area and therefore does not seem to know what is happening. I would avoid this. <br /> <br /> Also, the "Holy Grail" is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the sacred reasons of Christian mythology, except in passing. Mentions of expeditions to seek the Christian Holy Grail are made, but never followed through. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is convincing and incomplete.
