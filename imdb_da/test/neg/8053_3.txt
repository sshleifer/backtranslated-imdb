Director Todd Verow's unexpected pivot to the sentimental dropout gives a predictable result: nothing new to see here. Attractive but compelling driver - these 20-somethings should be in high school? - Dribbling out banalities about confused adolescent sexuality does not strike me as the best way to investigate the anonymous promise that was just as self-involved, but also honestly, raw and in comparison not all that maudlin. I have no idea what to do about this killing and uninspiring movies, except hoping that Verow will find another career. Of course, it's unpretentious, but it's also Mike Huckabee. However, no single attribute is as horrible as Jim Dwyer's chintzy, electronic score, encountering the full-length, full-length wall-to-wall of this movie. If I had seen this and heard this in a theater, I would have gone out. Fortunately, I could scrub on my laptop and turn them off.
