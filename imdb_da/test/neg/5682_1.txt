First I have to say that I do not like the fiction movie ever so much! But there are some movies I liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (most) others here. The film is still in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to see all the time. I think what they have done well is the animated scenery with 3 suns and 4 moons, but that's the only one I liked. There are no intelligent dialogs (are there ???). But it's a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or some other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> To the Directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
