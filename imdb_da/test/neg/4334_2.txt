The evil bikie gang in this movie was called Savages, hence the title, but minor disadvantages would have been a better name for this upset of the weak actors trying to look dangerous. When they wanted to kill someone, they generously rescued their bikes very slowly so that their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them out of their bikes. Their manager had a bad lukewarm, but still thought he could take the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she didn't know where she was most of the movie.
