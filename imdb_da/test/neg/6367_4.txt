This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment to me. I have seen the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (at least the earliest I can remember and I was only 2 at that time). As a second year, it contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. But this year's show was the worst I can remember. Only very few good (decent are probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely horrible songs. Turkey's winning song "All Way That I Can" sounded to me as a rip-off of Turkish songs Tarkan's hit "Simarik", just leaving much worse. It didn't deserve to win from my point of view. Belgium's song "Sanomi", which comes in second, was a non-linguistic song. Wonder what is next? Animals singing? Nevertheless, the music for the song was quite captivating and gave the song a kind of dreamy feeling that the "text" seemed appropriate. One of the better songs, but it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of Eurovision Russian duo t.A.T.u. In third place ended only three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with "Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia" ("Don't trust, don't be afraid"). For me, T.A.T.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprisingly almost everyone being some of the most covered girls of all female participants. They let their song speak, and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first choir, they let the song speak really well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was Austria. Bookmakers here in Denmark had the biggest odds on the song - a song that was actually beyond terrible - but ended in 8th place. Could it be that his lap is shaken at the rhythm of the song? That performance was the one that made me and my family laugh most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun. Sweden did what they did best; ABBA. In 1999, they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven" by sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they made top 10 with "Listen to Your Heartbeat" again as they sound like ABBA, and once again this year they did the ABBA style and finished again in the top 10. <br /> <br /> England was finally punished for making the absolutely horrible, non-captivating songs that they have been in recent years. Ireland beat the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could go on with how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sorry about Aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved better than this. However, I was not surprised at the show. Eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. This year it was simply disappointing. Let's hope it will be better next year. If not for us, then at least for the Aussies. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for t.A.T., one for the near race, one for the shake shot and one for the rest.
