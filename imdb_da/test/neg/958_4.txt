This review contains a sub-spoiler. <br /> <br /> Nearly the beginning is "D.O.A." At least it starts as if it can be a smooth, entertaining piece of nonsense like Finchers' The Game. It's key character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmare sequence of events that seem to be creating a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot coincides with too much pace, leading to a dramatic twist not halfway when the character learns that he has been poisoned and only has 1-2 days to live. And it's simply too big a twist to randomly add to a story. Once that is the case, the film's only chance of success is if it treats a person's psychology in this situation as its most important, even the only issue, but "D.O.A." continues as if it were only a normal revelation like any other you might normally encounter in a thriller. The problem is twice: First, Quaid's actions do not convince as what a person is, his situation is likely to do; and secondly, even if they convinced it, it is difficult to worry about what happens next, where the most significant point has already been solved prematurely. The rest of the movie is pretty standard fare for a movie of this kind, but became more boring than usual by the character's slightly treated problem, which logically dwarfs the events the movie is interested in. burnt out professor or as a man destined to die: Meg Ryan is so often ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. See 'The Game' instead, which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven, while 'D.O.A.' drives into developments that only undermine its own premise. Since the premise itself is quite exciting, it is a shame to see it drown in a surplus of over-cooked plot.
