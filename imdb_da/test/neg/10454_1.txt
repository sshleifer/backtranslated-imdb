I knew five minutes after the monster came out where he went. But when I saw the beginning credits I said "Oh my God, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers and he is almost unrecognizable), so I saw John Callahan who used to star in my favorite soap, all my kids, put on a few pounds, but he can still act, there was Veronica Hamill, I was not sick to see her in the movie, I bailed out for 20 minutes in the movie So bad, never see William Cat (from Perry Mason and The Greates American Hero) All these stars and a miserable movie, I hope he has got their paycheck. <br /> <br /> Poor Bad
