It's sad what they do into film festivals these days. I had to sit for more than twenty minutes of this boring card, which was not fun at all to get a good seat on a movie that I wanted to watch at a local film festival. The festival planner paired this horrible card with a great feature. I'm just glad the feature was good, otherwise I wouldn't have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a comedy short movie it didn't laugh. The title says it all.
