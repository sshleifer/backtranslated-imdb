OK, a movie about a movie taking a crack in video production can be entertaining. Could be, should be fun, edgy, even controversial or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the bizzaro negative version of it. Hamlin was entertaining as a "B" film producer. Shatner played crazy but equal and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was paralyzed. You will actually see the boom come down in a scene. The sound was awful in some of the scenes. Hi I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story had a clich√© diode.
