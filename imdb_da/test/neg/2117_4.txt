Joe was first released in the United States in the summer of 1970. Despite respectable messages, reasonable cash registers and an Oscar nom, it soon disappeared and remained forgotten during the 1980s before being enthusiastically reappraised, somewhat unfair in the United States in late 90s. Thanks to this long-lasting inaccessibility, its reputation is to see it placed (inexplicably) along with Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is a theme, it is a movie about vigilantism it certainly is not. <br /> <br /> The reason is not worth synoptic. It's a flabby, hammy, and bizarre stadiumy ramble about an unintentional murder and the unlikely relationship that blooms out of it. The relationship and the largely class-based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated to ridiculous caricature; These two and their situation have absolutely no relation to reality. Almost everything about the film is cantankerous and unforgettable obsolete, which makes all things absolutely fascinating. Hippies are depicted as cunning and exclusive misanthropes. Hard medicine also allows you to sleep or dance maniacally with lipstick on your face, and most young women are ready to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a plane. It's a lot of a 60's movie instead of the 70's, so why some industry lights have begun to include it in retrospective talks about the beginning of Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese of all people himself was involved, but probably only to give a nod to the ugly, lavatory shades of the ugly city chemistry that almost certainly affects the taxi driver four years later. But Joe seems a lot like a furious tirade against people like Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than a continuation of the same rebellious cinematic ethos. It's not a film of any real artistic significance - despite Joe's incontinent rage on everything in his world, it remains a story of absolutely nothing - but its value as the cultural museum is unprecedented. Shot on and around the streets of New York City in the darkest hours of Vietnam's war, and at a time when America (and essentially its cinema) was revolutionized the scare of the old guard, the film ends in its own completely ignorant and unintentional way and says more the story than many infinitely superior films that immediately tried to capture it. <br /> <br /> But as a movie? Despite a really surprising and effective shock ending, this is basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so well made. How did you source it? ** Incidentally, if you, like me, are a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes, then check out Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 in the hippy art gallery.
