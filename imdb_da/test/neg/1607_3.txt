I have not only read the book and watched the movie, but I was stationed at the USS John F Kennedy when they filmed this. Needless to say, movie staff and actors can try to do their jobs. Now about the movie. As a mariner's career, I was quite concerned about how they showed life on board an airline. I could pick the inaccuracies in the whole movie (someone who has lived on a carrier could) but it would take pages. A particular stand-out scene was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and they saw a RADAR contact movement across the screen. Every time the switch moved, it beeps. Unfortunately, that equipment does not come that way (I was a technician on that equipment). The book was based on fact, the film was not. The sequel to TV shows was just as bad, and Navy finally realized that support for this series would only make them look bad. If you are a marine person, see this to see how a movie about carrier life is seen from Hollywood's eyes. If you are not a Navy person, see Midway or Top Gun, at least these movies are entertaining and based on facts.
