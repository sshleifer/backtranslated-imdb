Like the previous commentator on this movie, I also found myself in tears at times during this movie. Sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring horror comes to reality. From the very first moment that our protagonist awakens in his New York apartment from a dream of subway stations breaking with galloping horses (what Irish foreigner has not had one), it is clear that we are in trouble. And it doesn't get much better. <br /> <br /> Speeding back to the 1950s Ireland, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation and solely on the subject of the Irish Civil War. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. The drinkers in the pub split up according to their civil war responsibilities. Reminders are made for those who died in the civil war. The city is divided between those who believe we must remember and those who want to forget ... the civil war. Every look and conversation drips with meaning that traces back to the civil war. <br /> <br /> Blurb on the video cover from Broken Harvest suggests that the movie is a resemblance to the problems of modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that today the Dublin conversation is actually dominated by a topic: housing prices. If it intends to offer some kind of insight into Ireland's obsession with its past, it doesn't fail. It is striking how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its heritage. But it will take a movie with much more subtlety and intelligence than this to tell us something about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. For the American viewers who have proposed the movie, the atmosphere in the 1950s evokes Ireland: it doesn't. 1950s Ireland was a horrible, poverty-stricken pit of sexual oppression and misery from which young people fled in their convulsions. But there was more than one topic of conversation.
