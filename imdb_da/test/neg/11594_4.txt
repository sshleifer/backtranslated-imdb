This is like a zoology textbook, as its depiction of animals is so accurate. But here are a few details that seem to have changed slightly during the transition to movies: <br /> <br /> - Gun balls never hit giant Komodo dragons. It doesn't matter how many times you shoot at Komodo, the balls just don't come close to it. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Cobra or a giant Komodo dragon is just to stand there. The exception to this rule is if you have been told to remain very quiet, in which case you should run off until Komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there and expect defeat. <br /> <br /> Minutes of chopped slow motion footage behind the credits makes it really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool and ample replacement for losing your sailing license / being arrested. <Br /> <br /> - Members of elite army units cannot see the giant Komodo dragons come to lie within a meter of the oversized creatures. Perhaps these dragons' computer-generated character has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - When recording a news story aiming to postpone illegal animal testing, a reporter and a camera man with a camera is all the gear and staff you need audio equipment, another camera, microphones, etc. all superfluous. When you hear a loud animal scream and a person has a gun, he should take it out and point to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you take a gun out, the sound of safety is taken off, even if your finger is not close to safety <br /> <br /> - The reporters agree to go halfway around about in the world to postpone something - without having the weakest idea what they postpone. Background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism. - Small arms hold at least 52 balls in a clip and then more than in the next clip. Despite this, they argue with guns that they will need more ammunition. - Precious cameras (also remember that the reporter only has a camera) is regularly left without a moment's hesitation or regret. These cameras do great to get back to the reporter himself. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really the stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who doesn't say to go into a house because a Komodo dragon can easily run through it, making it uncertain, takes a team in a building of the same material for protection - and no one says a word about it. <br /> <br /> - High-tech facilities look like simple offices with high schools. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in one day, but do not grow at all in the weeks. <br /> <br /> - Military destroys routines throughout the islands when people do not meet contact deadlines. <br /> <br /> Men with weapons do not necessarily change the direction they are shooting when their goals are no longer right in front of them. Instead, they just keep shooting in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you are, the greater your chance of surviving big giants. <br /> <br /> - Women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of the minds. <br /> <br /> - Every time you are chased by giant creatures, it's a good time to hit girls half of your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal sounds are an appropriate "noise" mask noise in the same volume. <br /> <br /> - Old Israeli and Russian aircraft are regularly used by the US military.
