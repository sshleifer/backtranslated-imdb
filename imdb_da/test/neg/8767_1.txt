This movie was horrible. You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the movie, and I literally hit the eject key in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain movies combined. To start, the play was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the throes of survivors, but one would think that any television experience would have given them a little more talent. The second biggest problem of the movie was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality. In the film defense, the theme of the show was good intent, and the story was okay.
