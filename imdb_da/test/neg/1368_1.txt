I watched this movie when it was first published in Pittsburgh Pa. I had traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of approx. 85 miles. I didn't know anything about the plot or the players. I had read no reviews or had I spoken to anyone who had seen it. Believe me, I will never make that mistake again. It was proclaimed I think as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process. That was what lured me to do a 170 km tour. <br /> <br /> There was a waiting line two on top of it stretched (I don't ask you) 2 or 2Â½ blocks long and moving very slowly. I could hardy wait to be seated. If only I knew at the time I would soon know, I could have been on my way back to Youngstown when it began. <br /> <br /> When the first 3D scene was shown, I already nodded. The news was quickly thin and from then on it was pure pain. <br /> <br /> Without going into scary details, I can only offer the following advice. If you've ever seen the famous movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, it stands in my humble opinion head and shoulders above this garbage. I do not know if this has ever been shown on television, if I do not know why. If you ever get the chance to see it, do something else. Take a walk, cut the grass, wash the dog, if someone has hit you with a rubber hose. ANYTHING. Your time will be spent better. <br /> <br /> This has been my first movie review. It may well be my last unless a worse movie comes together and I wouldn't make a book that will happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
