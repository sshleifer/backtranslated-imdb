Another tiring drill from Anthony Minghella, which seems to thrive on these big inflated super-productions, takes over two and a half hours to do what a reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes. The story centers on Inman (a somnambulent Jude Law) who goes out to the civil war, just starting a kind of romance with Nicole Kidman, a preacher who has recently come to the beautifully photographed backwater city. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's neglect and war disturbances (which is guessing what boys and girls HELL !!) and Kidman's trials and trials back home (which is very predictably incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back in shape after Kidman's saintly Daddy dies of unfortunate techno-disease. Zellwegger seems to be all crazy and bossy in the Granny Clampett kind of way in which he delivers enough hard love and homespun wisdom to turn the belly of even the toughest watcher of Touched By An Angel. This movie is simply rude. Avoid it as the great inflated Oscar bait Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation nonsense that it is.
