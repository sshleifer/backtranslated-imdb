Okay, Chuck Norris has appeared in many an entertaining movie over the years. This is not one of them. I don't even want to disturb trying to get into the plot if a Bible message has disappeared. The protagonists' "play" is so wood that Pinocchio would have done a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than that in Deathstalker. While traditionally low budget spooky movies often try to capture their audience by adding lots of graphic violence, this tries to capture an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo to the spectator. The plot boils down to different versions of the Bible.
