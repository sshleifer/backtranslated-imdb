What a gigantic pile of vicious endurance! Yes, god, where do you even start with this one? .. Well, among the crap acting (including a bloody infuriating woman who speaks as if she either a) creeps painfully on some ice cubes or b) has just woken up after going through some extensive root canal operation, editing that seems to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced ​​using an angle grinder, some really hopelessly choreographed martial arts actions, a script that has apparently been written by a two-year and some of the most hideous and intrusive high background music ever committed to any movie and hi presto, you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (though note that surprise, surprise there is actually no real ninja anywhere to find in this sodding travesty!) <br /> <br /> In a nutshell if ever was a movie-like equivalent of a very fierce battle of dysentery, so it must surely be! Avoid at all costs!
