Stay away from this movie! It is terrible in every way. Poor acting, a thin recycling chart and the worst end in film history. Rarely do I see a movie that makes my adrenaline pump of annoyance, in fact, the only other movie that comes to mind immediately is another "people in a plane in trouble" (Airspeed). Please do not see this as it is complete and completely pathetic from the beginning to the end. Helge Iversen
