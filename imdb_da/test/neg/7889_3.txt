For purposes of light entertainment, this movie is actually successful as such during its first half, but then subjected to a quick foundering script that drops it down. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" theft and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins in a department store where they once are late and locked in, and witnessed from their lesser than a protective glass observation point, an apparent murder on the street. The apparent killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins as he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the previous night's violent event and reaches one of the presenting couples "flincher", begins to faint. Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective reports a crime report, Harry's criminal background remembers him cynically. There are many ways in which a movie can be hackneyed and this manages to exploit most of them, including a mandatory slow motion-bedroom scene of passion. A low budget affair shot in Vancouver, even the police's procedural aspects appear by the mess. The always talented Gershon is trying to do some of her role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarre when he attacks his lines with a clear barrel. Although the film is silent, filmmaker Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow up with the camera and highlights some brilliantly realized compositions that a viewer can focus on while ignoring plot gaps and ignorant dialogue. A well-earned score, appropriately based on the action, is the contribution of Hal Beckett. The mentioned dialogue is first and foremost something fresh and delivered well in a handling way by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context with flawless continuity and logic takes over the predictability. The direction reflects the lack of original ideas or views, and post-production failures put work back longer than expected for a basic thriller.
