1. watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): Exactly worthless, supposed thriller who spends more time pulling us into sexual encounters with and without the star 'Amber Smith'. It tries to catch up with a story about the sex scenes, but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well. I was so sad this movie that I actually quickly submitted to the end to get it over with. The video version I saw was called 'Tell Me No Lies.'
