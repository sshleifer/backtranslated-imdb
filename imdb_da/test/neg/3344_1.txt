This movie is so unreal. French movies like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? I didn't even know why. What? The familiar sex scene of half siblings? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based on is so unreal. What is the use of it, then? Can you easily find in life, half siblings do such things? <br /> <br /> Have I learned anything from this movie? Yes, some people are just as happy to waste time making such films, such stories, such non-sense. But for those who like nihilism, nothing in life or simply a life without hope, then you are ... you have to watch this movie. Only one worth adore, though: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is such a strikingly beautiful woman.
