A female friend invited me to see this in the theaters. After half an hour we went out and went into the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to catch the beginning of Against All odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around saying "the eye, the eye". Very little about the signs or introduction to the story conquered one of us or was even memorable. It just hit the point of being painfully boring (and believe me that any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend). The production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a great studio release and we came to watch a movie, not an art gallery. Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell seemed to be wasted in such a poorly written film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you enter the second hour, there is something worth seeing. I don't have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10
