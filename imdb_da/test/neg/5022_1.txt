Don't kill me fans, but I have something to say about this. Advantages: Well, the most mildly interesting season I've seen out of all the seasons out there in Inuyasha has just been to the Shichinintai arch. Unlike the rest of the season, I personally think this one has more of a real plot line and the mercenaries; good god, they are so nice characters. Shame they were killed by. Of course, I want to write a 15-page essay, why I like Shichinintai so much, but it would be boring for some of you. So this series actually has some sympathetic characters. I will miss Bankotsu ... poor, bad psycho little boy. Cons: Outside the Shichinintai arch, the series was totally dull, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely annoying. Kagome for example: She overreacts too much to my taste; she seems like Yuka from Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He's a tall dog-dog demon with a big sword. What's so unique about him? He has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talking, no action and very cocky. Naraku just has to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the animated world. Miroku and Sango ... they have some colors but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much. But what bumps me most if the fact that they have no common SENSE at all. Rumiko Takahashi has done a lot better than this. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like lots of actions, no annoying love triangle, no repetition, then it's not for you.
