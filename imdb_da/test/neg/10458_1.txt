A great cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had some of these things, then it may not have been among the worst movies I've ever wasted an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written Shakespeare's complete works, but along the way it has appeared in their trash and somehow it was made into a movie. You can tell the actors regret to sign these contracts with every word they mutate directly into the camera. CGI is amateurish to the utmost, and they could have created more excitement of the casting has been attacked with the Sinclair Spectrum it was created on. I would like this movie, it has nice cameo appearances by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I expected a fun horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously. In fact, it tries to take seriously, but is just as much fun as going to the dentist. Do yourself a favour. Don't watch the movie, you just want to encourage them to do more.
