Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he went to the west coast. In addition to his dreams of Las Vegas, he rented the idea of ​​acting. He was a looking guy and about 7 years younger than his buddy George Raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this movie and, despite the hair dye, he's too old for this part. Beatty was overjoyed; Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; Beatty just doesn't radiate threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vanity project for Beatty, who has not been endorsed by the fact that he is no longer a leading man. <br /> <br /> The other great annoying miscast is Mantegna as George Raft. Raft had a distinctive voice and manner, none of which, like Mantegna, attempt to match. You never even believe that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have both pretended to be younger for years through massive use of hair color, and now it's a sudden shock going gray and game parts.
