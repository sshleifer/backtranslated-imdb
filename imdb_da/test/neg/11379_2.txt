I just turn off when the movie starts (because I saw Juliette Lewis name on the screen). The script seemed very complicated at first, but when the film continued, it became understandably clear. I concentrated on it, but the result was disappointing. The subject of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily, and it seemed to me that the director ignores those who tend to oppose sex. In my opinion, the well-prepared script could not be designed. We are looking at the cast, the movie promises something in the beginning or I was expecting just too much ... and finally the end ... the end is so very mediocre that I would not expect. The main character Cassandra will tell you about having baby and how a baby can change a life, in my opinion this scene is the real disaster for the movie. All in all, the characters are fun and acted beautifully. But only cast cannot save a movie.
