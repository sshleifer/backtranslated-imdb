Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his friends decide to give a "hazing" to offset diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike and his buddy decide to take Sam to a cornfield, tie him to a cross next to a freaky-looking scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? Well, backfire when Sam enters a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo, and Sam's revenge passes into scarecrow that comes to life and begins to chase the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening problem. Can Sam's best friend Jack (Matthew Linhardt) & his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save the day & Sam's life? <br /> <br /> Posted and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third directly to the video entry in the scarecrow series and while I haven't seen any of the two previous ones after watching Scarecrow Gone Wild, I have certainly not in a hurry to change the situation it is safe for. The script actually has an almost decent premise when Sam's rejected soul seeks revenge, and his friends must keep the real Sam alive in some way, but the way one is told is poor, and I suppose the basic is just an irrelevance that this is a movie about a killed scarecrow running around killing people in not very gory or imaginative ways. That said, there are one or two scenes here that save it from a star rating, the whip in the corn field is fun and something very immature blokes can do (like me) that bit when two guys bury their buddy in the sand and then Standing over him and pissing on him is also quite fun in a laddish youth's way and a cool bit when a guy starts singing a horrible song so scarecrow throws a pole accusing him! But these OK bits are few & far between & as a whole it is a silly, boring, poorly written teen slasher movie with very annoying character that annoys. It is also very predictable and has a stupid twist that does not contain scarecrow at all, which is a problem as when you see a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild, you expect to see a scarecrow go wild and I have to admit that he Looks pretty cool as horror character go. <br /> <br /> Actually, Katkin does a reasonable job here, even though what on Earth is up to the hospital at the end & all that neon illuminates everywhere & there is only one patient there & two employees? The cinematography is much better than the usual straight-to-video low budget war film too late, and there are some fine, if totally unrealistic, lighting. The film lacks real scary or tense, and some of the medical terminology used everywhere is a bit bad to say the least, and I say it as an insulin-dependent diabetic myself. There is not much going on here, there are a few scenes where some actors have some fake intestines placed on their stomachs to show them being blunted, but it looks pretty fake, there's also a burnt face and a few impalements. but a little different. There are quite a few naked female breasts on the show, if that's your thing. Technical Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget abominations I've put through recently, unfortunately it's still a bad movie overall. The least said about acting, the better. Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the just-to-video scare bands that have recently turned up, but having said it's not that much better & it's still a bad movie when everyone said & done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Fugleskr√§m (2002) & Bird Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which went directly to video.
