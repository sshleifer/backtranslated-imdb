*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski's "Here on Earth" holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material for 96 minutes. Literally, all controversies, clichés, and well-known plot elements are somewhere in here; there is simply nothing unique, original or fresh about it. God what a disturbing movie to sit through; I wish I saw the movie during its theatrical release last year, so it could have earned on my year's worst list. It is the kind of movie where the story immediately becomes obvious and goes downhill from the opening point, and worst of all takes itself seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible, painful films that come down in the yeast for a while. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a teenage heart film that includes some of Hollywood's most valued young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit as varying description and take the lead by storm. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and rude student with a wealthy father (cliché number one). He will graduate as a valedictorian and attend the Ivy League College after in his father's footsteps (Stuart Wilson). This creates "I don't want your life", cliché where the father tries to control his son's life while his son resists rebellion. Throw in Kelley's late mother who committed suicide a while back. When his father brings home another woman, he brutally asks his intentions ("no one can replace the mother" cliché counts as number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a sign on the opposite side of the community to kelley His family owns a local dinner. Enter his long-lasting love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a waitress at dinner, covering her sister (who has no purpose instead of controlling the following scene) when Jasper and Kelley act as childish morons by driving their cars and (oh no) collide into the dinner, causing it to break into the fire. (Conflicts between the rich and the poor will count as cliché number three.) <br /> <br /> The dangling billet sets both Kelley and Jasper up for a constructed and likely conflict. They are in trouble with the law, but because this film feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time: they have to work together to help rebuild your dinner. <br /> <br /> The two boys work hard during the summer growing strongly and getting a nice tan. Samantha's eye catches Kelley, and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants what is best for his true love (cliché number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of her little romantic threesome (cliché number five), but she continues two timing Jasper without another thought. Her father is also the local sheriff, how surprising (let's count the melodramatic nugget cliché number six). The distinguished romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there be any romantic excitement? If the film is to induce involvement in Samantha's choice between the two young men, then we must see both signs from both sides. The film depicts Jasper as a distraction to her "just love", Kelley. Obviously, Jasper really loves her, but it's also clear that she doesn't love him back. This definitely beats the romantic excitement early in history. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski does no harm here; But her charm and friendly performance doesn't fit a two-timing character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also entitled to Jasper's role, but the film gives him nothing to do with Kelley. Chris Klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here; He spends a lot of the film shirtless, sweaty and overtime. Unfortunately, he does not show his ability to act, perhaps because he has very little. The support molding is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood delivers the best performance in the movie but doesn't have enough time to save it for just a few short moments. I also enjoy the performance of Stuart Wilson, who fits perfectly with a rich, controlling father of high social status. <br /> <br /> Then we lean on Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes in the movie (another spoiler in front). What this is, she has a serious incurable disease (another shame in the picture, about eight o'clock). Her terminal illness brings the two competing young men together as friends, at least I think that is what the film aims to show that the loss of a loved one by two widows can bring both together (cliché number nine). <Br / </p> <p> Klein repeats his valedictic speech to demonstrate that his character is more than a low stereotype, but we have seen this so many times before I prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental, who hides the actual feelings (cliché number, um, was it ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and inane; a "your mother" comment triggers a fist fight while restoring the establishment. There is a retread from "Armageddon", which Samantha and Kelley burst into an open field, horny as hell, as he slowly moves his fingers around his body and names areas for American cities (why not call number eleven). The movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic excitement: A drunk Kelley is fooling herself after battling with Samantha's date, Jasper, but the following day he only recites the desire to dance (cliché number, oh no i lose count).
