Overall, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was pitiful in relation to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it could see the countless obvious errors. There is an immense difference between the two. It seems to me that the director went into a lost battle. I couldn't imagine anyone taking on the monstrous task of recreating "Heart of Darkness." History's immense details and magic would be impossible to interpret fairly. Conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it seemed pointless to try to make a visual interpretation. First, it is not possible to capture the details of the story. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be justly recreated through film. Marlow's feelings and feelings cannot be interpreted in the film. If you took the huge task of tackling Conrad's work, then you know as well as I do that Conrad only wrote half of the story. The other half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as the reader must be able to derive and associate Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result, several important details are absent in the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a suitable length, the movie seemed short. It seemed that Conrad was able to pack many more details to 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half. The movie's speed kept the viewer from knowing the characters. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The book's view puts you into Marlow's shoes. But in the movie you almost see Marlow from a distance. I began to think the director was trying to use the same "read between the lines" method that Conrad did. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I hadn't read the book, I would in no way begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be misinterpreted. His role was short and the details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the true Kurtz in the time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god to the Africans. I didn't think any significant details had been defined. Also in the book, Kurtz represented a funny being. He was dead long ago. I think the director has understood this detail. But instead of recreating it, he just had Kurtz mop around and mumble everything. Moreover, it seemed as if the director tried to make Kurtz seem mysterious, but instead he seemed completely unidentified. <br /> All in all, this movie reminded me that a teenager hit to finish a science project because of the next day. It seemed to have been designed effortlessly and in almost no time. The characters were alienated, important details were omitted, and overall, the central plot was lost in translation.
