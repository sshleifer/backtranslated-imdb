All dogs going to heaven were a quirky, fun movie; With good name talent who casts out, an adult learned about a cartoon basics for children. It was just interesting enough to be sympathetic to adults apart from something good for the kids to see. Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel trying to make a little cash ride on the first coattails. Charlie Sheen is an acceptable substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second movie and Sheena Easton's voice in a couple of movies, but forgettable songs make her a valuable choice as co-starring for this. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and you think it would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first. Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good voice actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in Anabelle's terrible role, this movie cannot be saved from the terrible production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) of this entire movie. Terrible editing, synchronizing the voices and flattening out spaces where characters should move to dialouge, but are not combined to make this movie resemble a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it might have been. <br /> All in all I would say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie, I would give this a very large PASS.
