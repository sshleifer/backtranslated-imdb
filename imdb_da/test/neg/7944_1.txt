I don't think it is necessary to outline the reason for you because the site and other users have done an excellent job already. That said, here's my take. This is by far the worst movie from 2005, and there have been some really, really bad ones. I don't even have to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie. Poor acting, bad plot, poor conducting, bad special effects - you are called. If it does not stand alone as the worst movie ever made, it is bound by something else. I would be embarrassed to make my friends know I was in this movie. But hi, most people who are going to see it do it, no matter what reviews it gets, so more power for you. When you feel the gaping gap between your neurons two hours in your evening, don't blame me.
