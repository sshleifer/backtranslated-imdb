I rate 'The Decline of the American Empire' almost below average, as it wasn't terrible, but not good either. I liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. It was probably the most original aspect ?? a dialogue-laced sexual little movie with people who are extremely far from models. On the other hand, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a nearby community that is well in 'reject' when their own actions are their own death. A group of female friends and male friends use half of the movie and laugh at their adultery and acceptance of such behavior, and the other half "intellectually" speaks of how strong they are for their speech and actions. These are the normal targets of typical sitcoms, the protagonists making fun of parties that are mainly occupied by university professors. Unfortunately, it is not their "intelligence" or mastery of "history" that disturbs me. It is their pedestal made of ego and mightier than attitude that pushes me away, and not a sign I can relate to or like. When you cry, I could not care less ?? It's your bed. When complaining, I barely broke. What made me brittle was a sign you look red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand that it happens to some people, but it was hard to see. And I sincerely hoped that he washed his hands as he had no problem going straight back to cooking for everyone. At the opposite end of the nascent teachers, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. This made me scratch because no one seemed genuine; everyone was as superficial as their laughter on society. Unfortunately, no one left the root, you are as empty as the characters of these characters.
