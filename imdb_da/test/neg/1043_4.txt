Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move into their new Los Angeles apartment. They discover an old brass bed that Karen wants. Unfortunately, it has a really eerie story of kinky sex killings. "Deathbed" is trying to be a creepy supernatural tale, but fails miserably.The action is slow, the play is nothing special, and there is no excitement at all. Although sex scenes are paralyzed. The climax is quite gory and violent so splatter fans should be satisfied. But the first hour of "Deathbed" is deadly boring and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares.Definitely one to avoid.My rating: 4 out of 10 and it's generous. Instead, see "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak".
