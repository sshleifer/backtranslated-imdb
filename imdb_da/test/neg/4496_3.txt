I saw the Greek tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it very boring. I thought it was no better than a travel suggestion except one thing: For the first time in my life I realized why it would be good to be rich. Seeing nature out of Aristotle's Onassis yacht and getting my first real look into the rich and famous lifestyles opened my eyes. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: That was a good thing. Funny, I can't remember sex scene. I had not seen the movie when it was on the big screen and found the lovemaking session with the mistress memorable this time. Maybe because I was younger and single back then it was nothing big.
