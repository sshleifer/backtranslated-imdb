One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not the target audience. Target groups are women, either college age or middle-aged or anyone aged I guess. I'm not one of them, so the creators don't mind if I don't like it. But it will not apologize for the dialogue and plot being terrible. The protagonist, Phoebe, goes to Europe to find out what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an inane character that I hope no one identifies with. Faith is also a sign of very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be reasonable. As I said, the dialogue was boring and uninteresting. The reason makes it quite silly at times. The worst thing is that Phoebe and Faith's father are artists, but his paintings are quite terrible. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If your a guy, you'll ask for the end. If you are a chicken, you may be able to sit through it, but you will be unimpressed.
