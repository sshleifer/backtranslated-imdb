Why? Why? Why on earth does the truth tell about this horrible HORRIBLE movie? I still wake up in the morning and ask God why he didn't stop me from seeing this outrageous "comedy". I can't believe I paid to see this offense to my cinematic taste. I start to think that the 5 stars it has are because of Martha Higaredas naked and all the men who can't buy a porn movie and avoid seeing this ... I want to call it "thing" because it's called movie it is an insult to the Mexican film industry. The characters are a huge clich√©, the actor causing involuntary laughs and the script is ... Well, I can't believe a man wrote this. And just when you thought you've been tortured enough ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to tear my eyes out. The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only lasts 90 minutes (it will feel like centuries, but still). Really, avoid the Pope !!!
