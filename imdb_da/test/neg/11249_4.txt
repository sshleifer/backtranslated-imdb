Barbershop 2: Back in Business was not as good as it was original, but was just as fun. The movie itself lacked little things that the original kept, making it much more fun. Back in Business appeared to be just another worthless successor made to bring money with a very thin plot. Cedric Entertainment's terrible excuses for flashbacks destroyed the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try to get the audience to adapt more to the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not necessary, without the original charm, soul & spark.
