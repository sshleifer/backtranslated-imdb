This film was released shortly after the Conan films, a kind of conan Conan, Red Sonja, played by Sylvester Stallone's ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. She is not a very good actress unfortunately as shown in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie feels cheap, but strangely, Arnold Swarzenegger pops up in this movie, but not like Conan, even though he looks, works and fights like Conan from the two Conan movies, I don't know what's about. Yet he only looks every 20 minutes and doesn't last long. Maybe Arnold has filmed this in his time from filming Conan the Destroyer or something? The movie is still slow and slow for an action movie, skip this and see Conan the Barbarian instead.
