If you take the movies Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you will have a good idea what the movie is about. The only problem is that the film lacks production values ​​of either, and represents mainly cheap copies of the two previously. True, the film has lots of action, but asks the viewer to suspend faith. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in hand - and miss everything to start, nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole group. There is also a problem with poor editing when the school bus swings over, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to perform the job. And the lady driving the truck is superfluous as she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in thoughtless action and violence, then the film is easy to see. But don't expect anything on the pair with the Thunderdome, or even the somewhat cheap and sticky Steel Dawn.
