I'm a great lover of really bad B movies. And I especially love foreign / scifi movies. I say the cheaper, cheesier and campier the better. A low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed by the people who made the movie and the schlocky ad-lib players. First, there is no real plot, it is all kinds of situations "comedy" (if it can be called it). "Comedy" in this movie is more about characters who say essentially "look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Isn't it fun?" But it's only pathetic because nothing that anyone does is fun . There are no comic acts or any boiled plot to carry all the very imaginative scenarios through this expensive turd. The bad comedy and the lack of something remote is only exacerbated by the bad ad-lib actors who say really stupid things over and over again (maybe trying to monkey for catch phrases, maybe just b / c all in this is so bad), really Uninteresting women are being played as hot chicks, and people are barfing and passing into bathrooms. <br /> <br /> There was a medieval actor towards the end of the movie that I could tell had some plays and was a bit convincing in his role. He was so out of place as a solid BM in a weekend detox unit's bathroom. Corey Feldman was admitted for approx. 3 minutes in total (luckily we didn't have to stop with him anymore) and he was filmed off - probably outside his apartment heading out somewhere. He said a couple of really funny things about foreigners and having sex with foreigners, and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain of remembering) you will lose by seeing this waste, avoid it. If you make many fabrics, such as Adam Sandler's comedy stylings (and therefore have no standard at all) and are considered to be mentally slow, you like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think the people who raved about this must work for Troma or something, b / c I can't believe that people can be so paralyzed that they really enjoy this movie. (Does medicine really destroy your judgment so much?)
