I went into the Heart of Gold and thought I'd see a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I experienced a self-honored tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, instructed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a drill party from start to finish, that is, if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. Neil Young and the crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a padded middle mediocre rocking chair. What happened to the raunchy guitar in his previous solo action? I assume all his fuzz boxes were out and his exaggerated vacuum tubes exploded in the heat of his generation. As far as Demme goes, is this the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly visualized film. Don't waste your $$ on the Heart of Gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to dig deep into the personality of a rock and roll icon, you'll need to scrounge up a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll, which is hard of print. And baby boomers, don't bother squawking about how this review is penetrated by anyone younger. I am also one of the baby farmers who listened to cinnamon on acid and danced on the streets of Stones Street Fighting Man. Go back and don't look back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has something worth a document.
