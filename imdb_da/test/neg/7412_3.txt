Well, I read the other comments. Didn't think it sounded good, but decided to tie it anyway. Perhaps not so smart to read all the bad reviews before watching this movie, of course I will feel all the same weird things. Excessive use of dishes for variety, a couple of weird camera angles and cross-cutting dialog for various conversations with the same people taking place at different times! But notice everything I believed in myself: It would probably be boring if it all went chronologically. The conversation is not so exciting, but a little mandatory. And the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel that the story is fast forwarding for the interesting part. Skip the boring bits. At the end of the film, it also becomes a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I really liked this movie? No not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience boring while trying to introduce the characters. But he exaggerates it. It gets annoying and sometimes confusing. It was apparently only the second movie he instructed, so maybe he will learn and do really good things in the future. And if you sit there (in the future) read this wondering if the now famous director of other movies is worth seeing. Well, if he is good in the future, watch this shot and wonder how he'll ever make a third. Otherwise, this movie is not really worth seeing unless you are very interested in film making and you will see a way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something that can be seen.
