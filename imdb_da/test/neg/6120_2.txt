For any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania to forget. No logic to the battles, some garbage gimmicks (doink clown and Giant Gonzalez) this was a forgettable PPV somewhat rare for WWE (F). Hogan's logic wins the world's title at the end gave no meaning, and many people feel that it alone helps put the nail in PPV. From the meaningless gimmicks of the Roman soldiers, to simply some real bad wrestling (Doink vs Crush is the worst fight) to simply poor match (Scott "Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the greatest food cruisers, which make a comeback and work his first wrestlemania, face a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is a PPV that even the WWE has admitted, was far below what was expected.
