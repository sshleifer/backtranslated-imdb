Well, Dude Where's My Car can be at least a novelty as one of few Hollywood movies that seems to have been written, thrown, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can't believe it was done (or that I allowed my friends to get me through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "stupid fun," and the actors involved don't seem to be able to pull any kind of fun if the script had actually given it. Strangely, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has too much plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. Of course, of course they went for moronic, but it doesn't work at any level. There's only one aspect of this movie I've had: Donkeyylips from the old Nickalodean show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will make him the next Richard Gere himself, you just see ...
