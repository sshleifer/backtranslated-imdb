As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really undervalued), I must boo this movie. If you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour of course you've never seen a psychosocial thriller or never seen 20/20. It's like the filmmakers and actors don't like the way they shoot it and the way they played it would be a dead giveaway. Overall, this movie serves to turn on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. Not a fun movie to sit through, though if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see her place a hard lady.
