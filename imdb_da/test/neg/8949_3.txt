I never thought I would be caught saying this: But I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more entertaining than this 90-year-old drama drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually sets a standard of the genre of "High Octane" protocols such as CSI, CSI: Miami and so on. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karatehak action, as Walker's dispute on justice enemies, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science technology of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / Countertypes! That's right, Stereotypes / Countertypes! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderate Red States America who refuses to share with the old prejudices, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode where a child with mental powers ventures into Dallas, where he meets a group of children in Goth / Punk clothing and they start harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Central America perceives the Goth / Punk culture. I mean, get started, how often people who dress such robbery and steal from people just thinking about their own business. When there are blacks and latinos in the plot, it's always about gangs in some poor neighborhoods. Okay! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate recruitment of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, that's what Middle Red State America sees of these people. Finally, why is Trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the side kick an indifferent kick-kicker?
