CHE! is a bad movie and deserves the reputation of an accidental funny movie. It takes a serious issue and presents it as the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics because there is not much emotion or a proper story - just episodic segments are stitched together with the most stupid "true stories" reproduced by a variety of yutzes. /> <br /> This is a deserved movie as it is poorly written and acted. But what I've found most interesting about the movie is its apparent homosexual subtitle. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working towards a communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple - with Che behaving coy and dismissed and Fidel as the ardent suitor! Again and again, the movie is teeming with beautiful lines, as when Fidel asks Che "Cuba to need you .... I need you !!". I'm not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that the other reviewers did not point this out. But if you remember this when you watch the movie, it makes it much more exciting and even more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> A final note. In recent years, Che has been very beautiful - even a fashion show with lots of brain-dead teens who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts emblazoned with his face. Given that he was a cold-blooded killer and nihilist (an odd combination for a doctor), this new reverence for the man is gross. What will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on T-shirts and posters? !!? Even Communists with conscience should be horrified by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for, and I find it ironic that people with computers master a man who has probably killed them, gets a chance! <br /> <br /> Given how stupid and unintentional fun this movie was, it doesn't matter to promote the announcement that Guevara was not a hero. I would love to see a realistic movie of his life - with the good and the bad, but also with dialogue and a plot that apparently was not created by chimpanzees!
