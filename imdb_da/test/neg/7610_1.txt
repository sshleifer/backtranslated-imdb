I rarely give one or ten stars to any movie, but it was so terrible that I had to make an exception. I am a SciFi fan and have seen a few comedians on SciFi, which I really like. There was just nothing here to suffer. <br /> <br /> I realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. But even in view of that, the sentences and the effect are bad. The kinematics are mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The play is bad. A sad state when the female voice transmission to the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is poor. Scripture is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> The humor is not only subtle and sublime; It is nowhere to be found. As an example, a whole 20 minutes of 80 minutes of film spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and elevator. This was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's SciFi to 2001. However, what we end up with is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's SciFi C movie. At least, these movies were funny because they took seriously.
