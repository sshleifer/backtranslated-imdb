*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Last night I watched this movie at a screening. I already started to like Tim Robbins and love sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the filmmaker was interesting, the film producer's vision of the future was realistic yet interesting enough. I remember thinking of myself: "This is the most intelligent finished sci-fi movie I've seen in a while". Then they just couldn't hold it together. <br /> <br /> Even from the beginning, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" with this movie (namely, editing and later some of the writing / plot development), these issues were forgivable. They became unforgivable when the movie kind of lost all the momentum around the halfway mark, and then the movie just became boring when you realized it wouldn't go anywhere at all. <br /> <br /> Robbins couldn't breathe in his character, but did the best he could. His female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the movie's bend seemed to be that the filmmakers couldn't decide whether to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. They also didn't end up with. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Some of the cinematography: corn, it felt like "21 days later" sometimes. <br /> <br /> Very appropriate for a futuristic movie like this. <br /> <br /> I dug some of the location pictures. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. in the future it was realistic but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other smaller characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Part of the writing was interesting (early). <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name can't remember), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS UNDER *** <br /> <br /> A few questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the futuristic things in this movie was convenient to make a patchwork story. For VIRUSER. It was clear that the virus they gave her at the end of the movie that made her physically "scared" for him was just there so they could stay in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him to code 46. Then they take him away and delete his memory and the movie ends. Classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ends if you ask me. binds all the loose ends very nicely if you just make it a dream straight? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus? Why didn't it? t they are exploring the countless problems surrounding the girl who is a clone of her mother? It could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> Initially, I like the salutations from all over the world in everybody's speech. But it became intrusive, especially because their accents were not convincing. I get it, the future will undoubtedly be racist and culturally more androgynous, but it started to feel like an AT&T Global Networking advertisement at the end. <br /> <br /> If they were 'outside', how could they have been busted for Code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' was never well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a Visa, and other times it was just as important as life or death. Again, loose definitions can allow them to use it to glue the different parts of the plot together. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm starting to get negative about it, so I'm stopping. There were some cool scenes and interesting things about this movie, but it only gives a 4/10
