Having watched this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very bold decision to make a mouse for Goya when the artist led what most would consider a stormy, passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged throughout Europe, probably one that would have enough drama to draw. Although I understand that Mr. Foreman in connection with the microcosm in the tragedy of Ine's life was the destruction of the world, I was left to notice that there was so much of Goya discharged, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that each of us, because of man's fallen nature, is a potential villain in the flow of life, each of us has pain in us that we must fight with God's help. How eloquent when Goya says he should have helped Ines more, how true to all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The excellent ironic scene, once convicted of dying to the priest, pronounces the death penalty on Lorenzo, who originally condemned him, is the object of genius. I was back who wanted something more when the credits rolled. Perhaps less of the unreal coincidence, and more of the character's inner life.
