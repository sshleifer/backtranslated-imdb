there is only way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> It's so bad it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The play is so bad, I laughed my ass all the way through. The male management of this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure. I know this sounds ridiculous, but when you see it yourself, you can't agree. <Br /> <br /> The monster looks like a CGI guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies. In short, this movie is good for only one thing, a really big laugh to how bad you can get movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see bad plays, bad scripts and special effects have gone wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU
