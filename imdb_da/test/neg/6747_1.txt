Only in Hollywood's audiovisual fiction world could anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to get everything they are interested in, answer phones, walk up stairs, all in search of a demolition expert who is out to get everyone. Oh yes, and then we get Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He may be shot even though he has a vest on it, and then fall down a long staircase and still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. Every clich√© you can think of in tension film was used. I only saw it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh ,,,, but yes, it's great to see how morally superior this FBI agent is when she's pretty sure there's a bomb in an opera house and she doesn't speak the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
