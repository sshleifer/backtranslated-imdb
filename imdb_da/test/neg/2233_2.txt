At least it is with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, the professor from Gilligan's Island, no less, going back in time to 1865. What to do - why try to save Lincoln of course! There are not really interesting variations on this old theme. As another reviewer has said, this episode is extremely boring and unstable, with little to suggest that the "professor" is really back in the 1860s. Budget constraints are readily apparent and the direction is solid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it remains a very flat production. We often feel that we are on stage sets and are waiting for something smart to happen. There is a minor twist at the end, but I emphasize less.
