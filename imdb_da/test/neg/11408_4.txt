I really love horror movies and trying to give everybody I see as much credit (or sometimes more) as possible, but it really pushes the ticket ... most of the casts were very happy-able but almost none of them could act at all - but think again about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some good make-up but absolutely ridiculous special eg. All in all, I give it 3 out of 10 - and have other thoughts about it !!
