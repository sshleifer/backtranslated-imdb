I really hope the creators of these "movies" read these reviews so they know people just don't want their movies. They are just garbage and an embarrassment to the horror killer rock genre. Whether this was better than the former does not matter because they are both simply awful. I'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. Stop now!! Warning for horror movie watchers, DONT SEE, CROSS OR LOOK AT BOXES OF "URBAN" HORROR MOVIES, AND ABOVE ALL, DO NOT BUY THEM !!!!
