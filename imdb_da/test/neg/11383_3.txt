I started to be interested in the movie. It turned out that it could be a serious drama dealing with death, grief and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Unfortunately, it didn't stop. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with some consistent and credible characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely happy and inconsistent. Look, I know this should not be Shakespeare, but come on, I need a little bit of script quality and characterization. <br /> <br /> The act was okay, not writing that much. At one point James Brolin's character is touched to appear on a picnic underwear. He says it won't work to order him around. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes, she will tear off her clothes later. It's a shelf. This movie had a couple of unintentional fun lines. <br /> <br /> It was hard to worry about Jame's Brolin's character. As he easily gave his first wife things to his new wife, even though he allowed his daughter to snubbed, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him. I have to admit I didn't finish the movie. If it did 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to see and so predictable that I felt there was no need to finish it.
