I assigned this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which has been slaughtered without recognition in places. What can you possibly say? They took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shady directions and incomplete characters (because the complete characters in the scene version have had their inner sides - and insights - torn out). I'm very much to blame for the director, who seems to be burdened with finding ways to undermine the manuscript. There are so many awkward pauses, scary re-staged moments and awkward re-imagined line readings in this television movie that I sometimes forgot to love the game. I'm not one of those people who believe that genius playing is automatically inferior to film (on the contrary), but this particular genius game has been hugely understaffed by this outing. Now I hope they will make a * real * movie of this game. The world deserves it.
