Abominable British film from a Japanese novel about a very worried young man coming under the influence of a Hitler-like classmate and suddenly hurting his widow's mother's beloved. A couple of good scenes (Sarah Miles, who discovers her son, has looked at her and confronts him with anger, the bad face trying to infuse Kris Kristofferson into his death by being extra friendly), but what is meant without provoking shock? Ugly and uneasy, it doesn't show anyone involved in any benefit (especially Kristofferson, whose cave is staring and usual gravel talk is out of place in a psychological mishmash like this). Called without any kind of absurdity, director Lewis John Carlino seems to think that such a circumstance could actually happen. If he is right, it is far more shocking than something in "Sailor". * from ****
