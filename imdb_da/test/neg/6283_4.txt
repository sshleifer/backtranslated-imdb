"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is the third Tenchi movie. It seemed that its creators took items from the first two to do this. With the risk of giving out, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. Nothing new there. An earlier love for Yosho is the bad guy. It was done in the second movie. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko and starts to get boring. The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy. I don't personally know what AIC, it's decision makers, was thinking. I gave this movie a voice of 4.
