I realize that some time is expensive to make, and that shooting style (tightly framed shots for camera, moving camera, wide apertures, leaching) makes it possible to make such films at a price. As a style it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows multiple periods to be made. Like any style, it has its critics and supporters - there are probably even those who believe that this kind of recording has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only some of the saved money could have been spent on the script, whatever style is used, a movie needs good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is mostly very good. It writes less. It is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book, and much that is relevant to the plot is omitted, giving an irreconcilable collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book, under no circumstances see it. If you have not read the book, are easily happy and have nothing better to do, there is no harm in seeing it, but be prepared to be disappointed. It could have been so much better.
