An IMDb reviewer always calls a passable movie for the "cannibal connoisseur". Are there such people? I did not know it. But if you are one of them, hi, take a ball. The rest of you can find this tripe a little hard to swallow (pun), even if you, like yourself, consider yourself a horror movie lover. I have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now, although I never came to cannibal subgenre a few weeks ago, and I think I owe my brief interest in these groan-inducing films, oddly enough for China's total disregard for copyright laws. You see, I bought a DVD collection with two DVDs of all Wesley Snipes movie for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which turned out to include Last Cannibal World, Cannibal God Mountain, Eat Live, Cannibal Holocaust, Next, with Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. As another sequel, I immediately got a sinking feeling when the film opened with a cannibal in street clothes that wandered around major American cities, shot unsuspecting Americans with poison darts and then scrambled away at full speed. Having gone out of ways to keep film jugs scary, it seems that they have now made their way to the mainland. Later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a "training exercise". Unlock your daughters! <br /> <br /> For a long time, the film enters the old sister routine, when a young blond woman named Sheila begins her own investigation of her sister's disappearance, which sees nothing like her in any way, but she is willing to spend most of the movie naked so I guess it doesn't matter. It seems that after a shot in one of his victims, we met the effortless cannibal that we met early in the movie, which was not used to big city life, ran into the road and was killed by a van. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police force finds a mysterious movie file on him showing Sheil's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but apart from the movie, the guy is a complete mystery. As the piteous chief of police clapped, "we know nothing about him except he is dead!" Bad guy, he must have a headache from all this. I recommend a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw away tens of thousands of dollars as it is nothing in search of her sister. Perfect for hiring a nice backwoods guide caricature as the police obviously won't be any help. Of course, nothing new has been added to this minor subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism works almost as a background for a completely different kind of bad movie, about rescuing a missing person from the dangerous elements. Diving the plot of that clothing line is not difficult, all you have to do is add in a cartoon-like jungle cult of people who follow a guy who calls himself Jonas who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature , a process they call "cleansing". Personally, I just prefer to look outside occasionally. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is captured by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office to show up in this movie. When he pulls out his credible medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her: "If you don't believe in Jonas and cleansing (through pain), God will help you." He gives her a shot, and when she wins from the small squeeze, he apologizes politely to her. I feel a true believer in this guy! So far, there are lots of nasty sound effects on random shots of animals being slaughtered, and more than enough obnoxious images of women are cut up and eaten alive, so I guess the movie lives up to its name. The play is astonishingly poor, as can be expected, and interestingly, editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you should be able to relate to people who believe in totally crazy cultures to relate to someone in the movie. There are lots of foreign religious ceremonies taking place, making it harder to understand why Sheil's sister decided to return her to the normal community. I am too individualistic and do your own thing but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while, the movie falls even further into your basic run of the mill escape movie, just before we see the most ferocious reproduction of Glory, Glory Hallelujah in film history. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: In this movie, a woman is raped with a cut snake. If you need more reason to never see it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
