This little bad late 50's sci-fi horror schlock is not quite a loser. It is about a manned space rocket that crashes into a remote area. A lot of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in a kind of coma; He is kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. Nevertheless, the title alien monster quickly raises the head that causes general destruction, including partial removal of the head. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is pacing. It takes a while for the animal to appear and he really only comes in his own for the last 20 minutes or so. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation, but it is not really a problem as he gives a lot of comic relief. At the end of the movie, where we have the final stand-off, and this ridiculous creature begins to speak with the doctors voice, he killed earlier, you'll be glad not to have a giggle. Also in the brilliant X-ray scene, where we see alien embryos floating around in the astronaut's body - it's just too fun for words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the fun moments in the Blood Animal's Night are too few and far between. If you are a 50-inch sci-fi nut then it is well worth checking this out. Just don't expect too much.
