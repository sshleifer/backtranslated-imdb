This film had so much potential to be fun and yet moving, but also far from being. It had a great story line, it just wasn't done as well as it could have been. The odd "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense, and it was absolutely not necessary, they did not influence, nor did they improve or borrow any understanding of what was to come or happen. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was OK, but could have been extended for more. He played the crazy part he was given at his best. The character was fun, but again it didn't fall out of what could have been. <br /> <br /> Mila character was perfect and her performance was spot on. <br /> <br /> Finally, writing was horrible and more often than not, had no meaning, and his hallucinations did not fit the movie at all. This movie, with better scripting and directing, could have been a contender for the National Lampoon's Vacation as far as fun and bad things happened to a person on a trip across America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was only worth another "flush". If I had seen this at the theater, I would have demanded my money back and boycotted the movie. The only thing this movie did was waste an hour and a half in my life. It also managed to get everyone involved in the movie to look bad, simply because the film was a stinker. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
