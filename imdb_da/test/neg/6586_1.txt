"Polar Express" was a horrible movie. What makes this movie the worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as an innocent, sugar and harmless tale for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I have never read Chris Van Allsburg's book what it was inspired, but the most disappointing thing is that it was ruled by Robert Zemeckis, the same one who made the big "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", An excellent movie where he proved Animation could be appreciated for children and adults alike, while in this movie it appears he was the victim of his own ambition, and he gives too much importance to creating stunningly detailed details than an interesting story. I'm sorry to say this, but "Polar Express" has as much artistic level as an advertising campaign for a video game or toy. Everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless: the characters may look like humans, but they have no life on them, and they have a vicious eye in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You could see it on some parts of the movie and believe me it was silly. Take, for example, a scene where a child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that the sign, similar to Tom Hanks, makes a gesture like saying "you are stupid not to accept my offer". Second, when the girl says the toys are so "hot" and things like that. All the horrible movie kids continue to talk about, how big would be the gifts that Santa would give them. There is even a song about the gifts! The vagabond is an irrelevant and weak character. And in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? what do you think ? gifts! Many Christmas movies are close to saying something like that, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's movie" because if that is what the kids would learn, I would not think about how it would be our future.
