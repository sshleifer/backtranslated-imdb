I've seen the cheesy kung fu fighting movie. Living in Taiwan, they come in instead of sitcoms in America. I've seen movies make fun of themselves, but this movie belongs to the sad category of fighting films that are trying too hard with horrible actors, horrible props and horrible music to be taken seriously. I felt serious about the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a Bad Guy Pointing a Gun at Girl's Head a Corner "or the daring" Flight of the Helicopter ". Then the battle scenes were over and the credits rolled. They actually had me in tears laughing. If the "special effects" were not sufficient evidence that this was low budget, only two or three of the crew members, probably the locals, who, although good for the much-needed Philippine economy, were probably made to save money. , has ever done anything since this series of movies. They rented equipment, despite continuing with this film. It was also fun. What really made me go was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from GI Joe to pop up), but the end ... I guess it would be a spoiler if it really was a plot to pamper, but when the American ninja strikes the girl in Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, I would see him jumping off the roof and Jackson dropping the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.
