It has been a long time since I have been in a movie as boring and boring as this one. It is one thing to have a slow pace where characters develop progressively, or some aspect of the movie is clearly enhanced by such pacing (as "Lost in Translation"). However, there is a difference between slow progression and just as it happened in this. I look from the look of Helen Mirren's face that she must have been confused by her husband's disappearance! Surprise, surprise! What a wonderful creative moment was the master's and the wife's meeting. (sarcasm) And what good way that the whole story fell apart at the end. Really a masterpiece.
