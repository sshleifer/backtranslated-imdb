My friend and I rented this movie and within the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It felt like it should have been over within the first 15 minutes. It was a horrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of them in the movie, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. Never would I recommend this movie to my worst enemy, but someone I actually like.
