As much as I love trains, I couldn't forget this movie. The prerequisite for being able to steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train along the way must be right up there on the Impossible Plot lines hit board. Imagine two disgruntled NASA employees stealing the "crawler" who totes shuttles back and forth and drives it to New York and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Having said all that, it's a good try. Wilford Brimely is at his Quaker Oats best, and Levon Helm becomes a good performance as his dimwitted but well-meaning sidekick. Bob Balaban is the appropriate wormy as Corporate Guy, and the "little guy taking on the Goliath" story gets another flight.
