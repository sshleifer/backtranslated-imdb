As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic movie, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women" Remake of one of my favorites all the time. I've seen the original many many times, actually I own it. My rushing to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown". But though was: How bad can it be? She must know what she's doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. Botoxed women are a rather depressing affair. Meg Ryan or the one who played Mary - she as little as a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress who might wear a Meg Ryan mask - she does not bring to the character any of what Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new is a tired, convincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. "Friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith is as disconnected as anything I've ever seen, and if it wasn't enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best and funniest performances . Eva Mendes casting is really the poster sign for how wrong it is, how sick it is that this commercial attempt has come up. I didn't give it a 1 out respect for Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
