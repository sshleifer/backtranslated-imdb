It plays on SHOWTIME right now, but is going to be released as a movie called THREE or released in 2006. Mess ups include a supposed nude body coming out of the waves with her bottom on. You can have fun finding the others. It was a decent stranded, hungry, cold, crazy person video, but it's about it. And of course what a movie would be without sex. The lady has a nice body and the men are beautiful, but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood. Wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now release it as three. Billy Zane should have worn a top piece of hair or shaved his head completely. Juan Di Pace is great and there are a few good sex scenes. There is a voodoo woman who loves the character Di Pace playing, and in fact Di Pace is also called. Not aware of any connection, but probably related or married.
