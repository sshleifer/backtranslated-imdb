A few friends and I have the weird hobby of finding out really awful and completely fuzzy (for good reason) horror flicks and then watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and / or soft drugs. Surely many people do this, but they see movies as "Godzilla" remake while we torment our eyes and brains with things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, this is a prototypical bad movie! We open traditionally with bag choir music under the opening credits. Of course, this is to emphasize extra for us stupid viewers that history should take place in Scottish highlights and not in the director of Texas Larry Buchanan. For the same reason, the cast members are apparently also instructed to exaggerate enormously and talk to talk with horrible accents. The American Marine Biologist Prof. George Sanderson arrives in Loch Ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the legendary monster's abode in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids in a science camp (what a dull way to spend the holidays), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane crashing into the lake during World War II and a bunch of thieves and unsuccessful scientists stealing the monster's eggs. You think these numerous subdivisions provide some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a generally boring flick with only a few notable elements. The monster itself, for example, is a lovely cheesy creation with sweet eyes and a smoky breath. His teeth also shine in the dark, which is quite useful when you are stupid enough to go on a boat trip in the middle of the night. At the end of the movie, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe aircraft than in the monster, so it was time to unpack it. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended if you are a fan of bad B-movies from the 80s, but be aware that it contains an overload of meaningless dialogues and a bizarre hasty ending that makes it look like the movie suddenly ran outside the budget.
