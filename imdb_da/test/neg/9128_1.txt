Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I've ever seen. It is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never looks or penetrates. This is exactly what happens here. The camera is used to disturbing, arguing and ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead, some scenes are paved together for no greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best movie ever made, this is the worst. It's also a "clean" movie, but it's the negative form, exactly what doesn't * need to be done.
