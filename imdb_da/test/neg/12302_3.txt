There is only one thing I want to say about cat in the hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie, it sucks ... I wasted on how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but was it is Not really that baby fits. Oh and by the way the cat in the hat spoke was annoying ... as for the plot I totally forgot. Who cares if it sucked anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the authors tried to make it sound like him in Austin's powers without swinger talk and managed too much - but then what it was annoying. don't see it - it belongs to the bottom 100 .............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
