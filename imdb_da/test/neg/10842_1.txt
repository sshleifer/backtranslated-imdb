This movie looks like someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three fun options, hired a good throw, then turned it all into a really bad scriptwriter and even worse instructor. The director filmed a scrubbing romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artistic movie --- strange camera angles, blue-filtered shots, lingering, close-up looking at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; He was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock fought deeply with a sign that had to be a lot, but if wackiness consisted of things like kissing a man she hated, giving up her baby, attending carnival, offering to strip for money and bumming a trip with another airline passengers. The script had very few fun lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. It introduced potentially fun situations, so cut them off before they could evolve. To top it all, the "twist" at the end was a blow to the face of anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy. If you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it as I did, my advice is: Don't go to the movie. It will only spoil a good trailer.
