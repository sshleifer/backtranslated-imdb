Lowe returns to the reason for yet another failed relationship to find he has been awarded legally. It is in the plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes that the defendant is the girl, he has had a serious infatuation since the first class. Through life's past by telling others about his feelings towards this girl (played by Camp), Lowe remembers these feelings and does everything in his power to clear the Camp of Murder while staying away from the real evil at the same time and succeed in creating a successful movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I've heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States, and I also know that it has some ties to Ponce de Leon, so the background is a good place to start. Unfortunately, the only good thing about this movie is. The local police are incomplete, the judge is an idiot, and the defense lawyer does everything to make himself look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know whether to blame the director for poor guidance, or just to let the cast put such an inappropriate effort. In short, this movie was so boring, I couldn't even sleep through it! 1 out of 10 stars!
