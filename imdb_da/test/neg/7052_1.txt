USA's AZN TV purchased the rights to this movie and the network shows it using the English title THE PICKPOCKET. 1997's PICKPOCKET takes amateur movies with home movies that make it amazing levels of discomfort. The film depicts a prolonged series of dull walks by an uninteresting, confused guy. This protagonist, Xiao Wu, simply does not go aimlessly. The viewers will unfortunately soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unmatched talent for searching and staying dormant near the most unpleasant sounds found in China. Clanging empty tin shovels are beaten with a stick - he's there. Every old engine in China clings in pain - he's there. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, he is there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most annoyingly unpleasant place on the planet Earth. The only item that is worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is the shooting. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes a little more. Finally, the camera rises, but then it falls to the actor's knees and remains only until a person in the crew realizes the error and starts shaking the camera again. Most of the shaking film is framed in distant, long, long, long shots. The few times that the camera comes close, there is nothing convincing that ever takes place to connect the viewer with what happens. <br /> <br /> Photography is scary, faded and often blurred. The use of color is - yes, there is no sign of intelligence that controls the use of color. Most every shot is kept 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful to sit through. This movie is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then it simply ends. John Woo fans like to hear part of the DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) soundtrack, as the protagonist hangs outside a video store for many minutes. Anyway, be warned - PICKPOCKET will steal away your good time.
