Czech filmmakers may have enjoyed and judged this movie a lot because it was Czech, but I found it to be tired, boring, moronic, boring and incomplete. Again, I suppose "ramping" to increase the sale of this dog by a movie. Amazon describes this film as if a couple of scholars who refuse to grow up, but I want to go again - I think it's about two fellows who have entered a state of dementia and performing actions that don't make sense for someone. I've been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the movie and I would believe it. When he saw his performance, he probably understood what a horrible work he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit" which I was certainly much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in "autumn spring." Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It's nothing but a dog in a crib.
