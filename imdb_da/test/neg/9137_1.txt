Director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and convincing man for this terribly broken project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message, which is so powerful and resonant in his former two Qatsi films, hopes hopelessly here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughs, etc. Mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imaging is mostly generic material from Getty Images et al., And the powerful digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way possible. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Could have pointed out that using a sunscreen for almost every frame was a very bad idea? The raw looping, layering and distortion of images resembles a freshman Photoshop class. And to make matters worse, the computer's animation sequences are more artificial than a 1980s Wall Street pie chart. This is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have saved this movie, but a little less effort in this direction may have made it acceptable as visual feed for the accompanying music. I feel compelled to point out that the score of Philip Glass will surely satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what glass does best with lovely violin contributions from Yo Yo Ma. If you decide to watch this movie, be sure to focus your attention on the short opening sequence. While you may already be familiar with Detroit's once majestic but long-standing Michigan Central Railroad Station 89 minutes later, you will find yourself remembering this image of the 20th century decadence as the critical point when you need to lead EXIT the sign / press the STOP button, etc. You have been warned.
