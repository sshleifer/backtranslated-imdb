This was proclaimed as a successor to Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good too, but boy was I wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive, except that they both take place on submarines. Second, the plot can be slow, dull and in some cases completely confusing. <br /> <br /> This movie will not keep people's attention. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes to be used for dramatic effects that make the viewer laugh aloud. The Corkscrew scene is definitely one. After I got over my first shock that someone would slip in and not know that people would not just believe it but laugh at the sheer silliness of it, I could find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the MD in a good sub flick, watch Crash Dive and drop this lame movie on the shelf.
