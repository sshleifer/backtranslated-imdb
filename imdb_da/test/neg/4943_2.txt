I am very disappointed. First of all, the German synchronization is poor. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better, but the whole movie looks as if the director saw Luna Papa and the Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in this style too. But failed in all aspects. It's an incongruous mix of a weirdly incredible story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sex humor. I voted 2 because 1 is the worst and the second point for 'Sybilla' she is really sweet. Sorry - I like 'Eastern' movies, but this one is really superfluous.
