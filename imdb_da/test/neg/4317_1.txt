This movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The tension created disappeared due to terrible action or lack of direction from the director. I do not know. It was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor, but you continue to chew it because it once tasted good. Like most thrillers The Hitchhiker had promise, but failed to deliver, as it had me keen eyes and ready to turn down the volume (I saw the movie alone. In the dark) This so-called thriller simply came apart as it was made by Lego transform into something else. It simply went out of gas and left me staring at a movie made for television, with one exception. It was probably rated -R.
