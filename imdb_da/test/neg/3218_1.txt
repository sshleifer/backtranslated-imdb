What is the deal with all these ethnic criminal groups that copy Italian mafia-related films? We all know the Godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican, which is just a pronounced copy. I can't see why other ethnic groups are imitating and imitating Italian mobsters, but that certainly makes them stupid. They seem to be wanabee Italians. I prefer much to see that the Mexicans do their own ideas and want to see their own culture and how they do it, instead of copying ideas from the Godfather trilogy. Apart from that, the movie was disappointing as it wasn't my thing to see Mexicans acting and trying to be Italians. After seeing this, I will now see the right godfather so that this movie can be deleted from my memory.
