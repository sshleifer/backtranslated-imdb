Angel-A is a change in the pace of Besson; monochrome, mahkish and rather mediocre. It is well-photographed on the spot in Paris, although subtitle readers should note: fast-fire dialogue and good movies can give frustrating viewing. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life". Despite its shared themes (celestial intervention averting suicide, being angelic / mortal), Besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. Even the well appeared, tear moments, quickly down in the toe-curling sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The flawless ideology of the film irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for himself is undermined all the time by his own violent and promiscuous behavior; a "happy ending" that excludes the heroes' supposed journey from helplessness to self-worth and independence. Rating: Pretty nice to look at, but confused moral and philosophical messages confuse the movie exactly where it should shine. 4.10
