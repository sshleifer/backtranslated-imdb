Wow. Not because of the 3-D image, which was sometimes used nicely to give a good deep imagery, but what a lame ends! The end of the movie just seems to imply on itself. This movie has to be one of the coolest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. The misogyny of this movie is also painful. If you are looking for a bad 50-year-old sci-fi movie to laugh at (aka 'fine foot'), go for it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
