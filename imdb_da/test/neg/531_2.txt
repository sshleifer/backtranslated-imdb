Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow Stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kick!) A karate instructor helping a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, her creators looking to detonate her and destroy a rival company. Along the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show off the duo, while Jack Palance is there to guide the duo on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to get pretty nice and off-beat players in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (don't know her? Now she was in a bunch of 70 porn), one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel and have to admit I wasn't impressed. In fact, it strikes, Cyborg 2 is an often nice looking movie, it is shot with excellent style and the visual detail makes it easy on the eye. But Cyborg 1 was the same way, in fact, the movie was aimed at a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. Unfortunately, as the first, this has no new ideas or anything similar to a plot or texture. Most ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons, the film doesn't have much to offer beyond that look. Another aspect is the terrible action. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are horrible, and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come in fine, but Palance plays seriously a cyborg warrior and Koteas is karate instructor. On the positive side, I believe that you cannot blame Michael Schroeder for not being ambitious with casting. The movie is still boring, and I for one lost interest in history fifteen minutes. Also why do they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which manages to be worse than. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
