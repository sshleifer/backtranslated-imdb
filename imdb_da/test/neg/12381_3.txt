This one is like cheesy as they come ?? The concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already obscured by words, but wait until you get a load of the god creature as it appears on the screen! I tell you that I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed on some of the expository dialogue ?? So again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and physics laws and such (which I have never been good in spite of my love for sci-fi movies) that it doesn't really matter! The bird ?? First depicted as a blurred form that whizzing through the sky, but subsequently shown in all its dopey honor ?? is so sublime stupid that it would not be wrong in a Looney Tunes cartoon (witness the series of intermittently taken photographs starting with the creature in the distance and ending on a side-cutting extreme close-up of the face)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears did much better with his second movie on UFOs, the fine agriculture VS. FLYING SAUCERS (1956) ?? with special effects delivered by a master, Ray Harryhausen (of whom I have just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring Columbia's newly released SE DVD); It also seems to me that some of the images illustrating the bird's rampage in New York were lifted from the destruction of Washington seen in the former sci-fi classic! Again, the heads of genre regulars are played ?? namely Jeff Morrow (from THIS PROPERTY [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); As with the aforementioned FLYING SAUCERS, these titles are highly acclaimed and loved by fans ?? Therefore, they are far superior to this regrettable addition to the alien / alien animal cycle prevalent during the sci-fi peak and beyond (otherwise, other flying threats were mentioned in FLYING SERPENT [1946] which I have not seen , and Larry Coh's tongue-in-cheek update of the same in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, THE GIANT CLAW can't even rise to a decent climax? which is so hurried to be "a leaching" to quote a jet pilot from the movie itself, whose rocket attacks on the bird appear completely ineffective (that is, before Morrow realizes that it is shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to find out of a way how to penetrate it). In the end, apart from the cumbersome (and frankly boring) technical asides, you get a feeling of "so bad, it's good" to look at this: It only lasts for 74 minutes? and at least the bird is such an unforgettable creation as putting a big smile on your face every time it comes up!
