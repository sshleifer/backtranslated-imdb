Schoolies is a pointless exercise ... Go to the Gold Coast, get drunk and have sex. Worthy ambitions maybe but not very intellectual. The reason is a simple as few sentences assigned to each character, and no one is helped by the clich√©s hidden here. <br /> <br /> Something that would help is molding. Everyone looks too old. These signs are apparently innocent, going out on their own in scary steps to adulthood, but they seem too old to be credible in the role. <br /> <br />
