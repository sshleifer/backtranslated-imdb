How? I wondered why I hadn't seen this in theaters, or even a single advertisement for it, and when I saw the movie, I realized that I was hardened HARDCORE. I am a big Transporter fan, and a big Blade fan, so when I saw this, I imagined some killer battle scene between two badasses, lots of gunplay, a whole lot of stuff. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a short como of Statham and Snipes. The guy who makes the sound and the video in the crime lab got more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie, expecting a bunch of Kung Fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad films from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the tab better.
