Oh boy. Where do I start on this piece of slime? This is one of the few real high-bidding movies on my list that I have actually seen myself giving a 1-rating, and it is not for the production values ​​that are quite high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible and treats the whole story as a ridiculous fantasy. I couldn't recommend it to anyone except to see how low a society we have become ... First, Noah was definitely not friends with Lot. Anyone who actually reads Genesis could tell you that Abram was the one they thought of. The authors just tried to wipe out the story with the entire Sodom / Gommorah subplot, and it doesn't work out because it is. Noah is treated like a prudish goofball ("You kissed! You kissed!") But at least it is a step up from Voice's hilarious overacting in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> But these violations are pale compared to the heretical treatment of God in this movie. God is portrayed as a small, indestructible being that changes at least whim. ("I'm an eternal perfect, but I can be wrong") What? Where do they get it from? This kind of God ... no one should ever be aware of, much less worship, praise or love. What the instructor says in this, I do not claim to know. I just know that a responsible treatment of Noah's Ark should not take such an easy way out. Shame on these people.
