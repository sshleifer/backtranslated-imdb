This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, so they deserve the credit for pulling it off. But this movie was awkward in its direction, sermon in its style, exaggerated in its play and far too politically correct. The reason was everywhere and prevented anything from developing well. Gangsters get involved in the story, although I'm not sure what their presence added to the movie except making the movie even more unrealistic. They could have been completely left out and the movie would have been better as a result. The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese Malaysian who returns to his homeland after studying in the West. His studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he must fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of Malaysian charts (quite a juvenile performance). The beginning of the movie suggests conflict with his traditional father, but when the gangsters are involved, this part of the story is erased insecure. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to take advantage of Malaysia's wonderful diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately, the way these aspects were put on film seemed to be terribly pronounced or even sermon. There is a beautiful scene of Malaysian women making a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems compulsory and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The play came out as something amateurish and male lead was particularly convincing. The female Malaysian lead was a remarkable exception, leaving the most positive mark. The film also has an overtly homosexual character, and although he is a little caricature, he gives some of the more fun moments in the film. But the movie was just a notch above a typical local television TV drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not the least offensive, has been banned in Malaysia. 3.10
