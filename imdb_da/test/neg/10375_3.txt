I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and had trouble keeping awake during this incredibly repetitive, inaudible little movie. It's a 75 minute movie that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modest engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interesting and provocative. With only a few exceptions, interviews dream about and on and on, making little emotional contact or context for the whole subject. It's more like a "guide" for something that can't be done anymore. I lived during the era, but felt a little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
