This has some of the stupid battle scenes of all time. If I was a veteran of a war, I would cry when I watch this movie, not because I remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a bad representation of any veteran of that war. Although the troops carry the M16s, the film looks like nothing like Vietnam. The Viet Cong uniform resembles ancient old Japanese uniforms from another world war film. Of course, the setting is some crappy Hollywood back party. The worst scene contains an American soldier fighting "hand to hand" as in a bad martial arts movie. When he sends out several enemy troops, he says, "Hey, come down here and let's kick some lap!" to a helicopter in the air. He is then shot. This movie is trash can.
