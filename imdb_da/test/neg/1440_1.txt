The most worthless movie in the decade. The responsible parties should never be allowed to film again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment that this movie provides. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again. Frankly, I think I would be a better person if I hadn't seen it. If I called it offensive, I would fall into a category of emotionally weak extremists. I would say that this film goes as far as damaging the industry. There are movies that I refuse to see now that I feel they may be so tasteless. I want an idiot that I didn't have the good sense to go out during any of the many moments I was forced to do. Yes, I saw the end and ashamed of it, like everyone else, including the author. I'm in awe ...
