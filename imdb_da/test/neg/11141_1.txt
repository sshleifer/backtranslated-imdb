This is absolute drive designed to shock and titrate 60's mindset. The action is entirely wood, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the substandard actors killing the first thing they can think of repeatedly. The end result is a poorly written game that is read by people who have no idea and could not care. One exception to this is the protagonist "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends much of the movie in a nude stupor (either rocky or the only one in the play that can act!) Please think I "don't get" Warhol - It's clearly a stinker that should never have made it out of a movie class.
