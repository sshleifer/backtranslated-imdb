I was totally disgusted by this unnecessary successor to "The Poseidon Adventure", a movie I have made a great comment about. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible from the word GO! I agree, why were no other lifeboats around and helicopters? Anyone who saved the original survivors had just flown over the boat, which Michael Caine & Sally Field is on. IT WAS THE SINGLE RESCUE CREW? Hard to believe. The action is generally poor and the show looks cheap. I really hated the waste of talent from some good actors. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie unless you catch Sally & Michael as lovers. <br /> <br />
