I saw this at the cinema during its first release and can only ask: "Has the world gone crazy?" The seemingly overwhelmingly positive response is insane to this poorly written, embarrassingly predictable trap. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a genius movie producer, as evidenced by the constant bombs he has produced since (check out 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder') <br /> <br /> I can only assume making a movie dealing with gay / transexual culture if people assume that it is not an insult to this sector of the population. Are we not smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Okay, the 3 leaders do well considering what to do with, but this movie features the worst performance of a children's actor I have ever seen, not helped by appalling dialogue and a real lame resolution that you can see one mile away. br /> <br /> This is a disappointing movie and one that doesn't deserve the overwhelmed reputation it has got.
