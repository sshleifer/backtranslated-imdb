Words fail me for this terrible waste of two hours of life. The story is designed for complete adultery. <br /> <br /> The action is leather and so much of this is ridiculously horrible. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is tirelessly terrible and unbelievable as Mike Sullivan, a journalist. I can honestly never remember seeing a worse movie. It is only worth looking at, because the terrible continuity lapses. After Jones has handed over a large butcher, he comes out without getting dressed. His girlfriend discovers a drink over him, and he chases her out of the pub-dried. It's pretty terrible, made everything worse by the talented actors that appear in it.
