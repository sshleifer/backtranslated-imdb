It says a lot about the UK when television programs like this are not only made but also run in three series. Involuntary, politically correct for disease and ill-acted and written. Meera Syal hasn't been fun or accomplished in anything she's been in, keep telling me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, the funny guy he is, is well past his eighties early. It's such a bad comedy that it could have been made by ITV, but even stinkers like The Upper Hand and one with James Bolam as a parking attendant are similar to Fawlty Towers in relation to this nonsense. I would like to sit down with the author / instructor of this show so they can point out humor in this program. It is clear that the majority of Britain's population consists of poorly trained chavs, but it would not tickle their fun bones. That's if they could tear themselves away from Big Brother or from their cell phones, but that's another story. Complete and complete dirt!
