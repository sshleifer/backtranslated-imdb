Purported documentary that tries to investigate scifi films from the 1950s and how they hit (and REFlected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill tells. <br /> <br /> Terrible. The "insights" given are nothing new - for example - the cold war and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children. Good duh! They try to cover all the different subgenres of sci-fi films from the 1950s - the big bug movies, invaded from space films, etc. Etc. It's good, but they choose the most obvious movies and they have been analyzed to death already. It was tough to see clips from "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The Earth Day Still Still", but all that the Directors said was so incredibly clear to any viewer that it is insulting. Although it is under an hour, I became boring for 30 minutes. This gets 2 for some of the rocks, but nothing else.
