When I first heard that there should be The World is not enough video game for the Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and I came through the whole game !!! The game was too easy and gave too many hints. A majour dissapointing sequel to GoldenEye. Take my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. Sure, weapons and gadgets are cool, but you get tired of a watch that looks like it was taken straight from GoldenEye except being a red color instead of a blue color, a bad excuse for a gun gun, a horrible stunner and a stupid grapple hook that can only be attached to things that are yellow and black. I think RARE should be making this game instead of EA, which has to stick to games that are good to do, like sports games and should be free of first-person shooters and let the masters do the job.
