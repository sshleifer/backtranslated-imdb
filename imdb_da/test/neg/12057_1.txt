How to round off all possible clichés and stereotypes that exist in the scare genre and then put them in a massive miserable movie? Answer: "Camp Blood". This is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro budget and a little too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most intolerable teenage characters you will ever see ?? they are like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying ?? go camping and quickly find yourself pursued by a homicidal madman in a clown suit. Don't even ask me what the murderer's motivations were or even who he / she was, because if that were the case in the movie, I totally missed it. This is one of the worst movies ever made, without inspiration or craft at all. The production values ​​were so creepy that there are actors who play multiple roles without bothering making them unrecognizable. The only half-decent and precious order in all "Camp Blood" is the opening, with the impressive successful Meredith O'Brien having sex in the woods with his miserable boy scouts. Yes, I am fully aware that this is a very low note to make, but then again it is a young and retarded movie, so who cares?
