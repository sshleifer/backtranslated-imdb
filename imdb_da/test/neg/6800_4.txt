I liked this if I didn't like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> Didn't really find Arbus unique visual aesthetics (as Stanley Kubrick did in "The Shinning," with the twin girls in the hallway, a direct greeting to one of Arbus's most famous images, and one with joking qualities, none of these films have, and certainly none of her character (outgoing), equality (thin and Jewish, not WP Queen Kidman) or life some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion that later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders" among many things. This film focused on the "freak" as its symbol of artistic and personal empowerment, in a very low and predictable way. Besides that, it could have been an interesting movie about the middle class fetish, but I was too annoyed to break me. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Arbus's name had been extinguished, it could have been less annoying, but had it not had her name in the title that would have been of interest to me in this in the first lap. A letdown from "Secretary".
