It hurts me to say this about an Australian movie, but Mr. Accident reaches out with the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is even more tragic is that it doesn't fit in 'it's so bad, it's good' category. What irritates me most about this movie is the rather large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless, unfunny, underdeveloped, scary manuscript. Stupid performances (What does Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast do in this trash?), Insufficient Direction, No Plot, and General Feeling of Patience take away from the interesting production design and leave you a truly awful mouth-watering taste. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
