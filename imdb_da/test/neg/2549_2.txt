Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough, where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and she has a Mexican girlfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) determined to track one animals down there who have terrorized the city, killed pets and more residents, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, an evil creature from myth and legend. Erm, I'm struggling now because not much else actually happens ... Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I'm not beating the bush here and simply saying that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is horrible, period. The manuscript only mentions the word Werewolf once and for the rest of the time it refers to a Chupacabra, I actually think this was not really conceived as a werewolf girl at all. The 'Werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless and more like an evil dog, there is no reference to anyone changing in the full moon, and it actually attacks during the day at a few times, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it gets killed, it doesn't change back into anyone either. To be honest, apart from the title, there is nothing here to indicate a wolf movie at all, and even then, the title is just a rip-off of the very popular American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade crap that I personally think to kill the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a real low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween ( 1978) or Friday 13 (1980), all of which were made on shoe prohibition budgets, perhaps The Blair Witch Project (1999), but that is the case in recent years, and crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance Ever to be considered a classic. The character is horrible and things just happen around them, the dialogue is garbage, the pacing is awful, the story sucks and almost sent me to sleep and as a whole this movie is just treasure, I'm sorry, but I don't know how else can describe it. <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does nothing to make this appear, which is the annoying handheld camera type filmography that could easily give any headache and quick 'blink and you will miss something' editing that just irritates and irritates in equal measure. It is not scary, there is no nudity, there is no tension or atmosphere & special effects are terrible. The monster looks really bad, and it is no wonder that Maginnis holds it in the shadows or cuts its scenes so quickly that you never get a good look at it. There is virtually no color in the picture, it is either almost whitish or over saturated desert sand oranges that also make it eye sore. Gore consists of some fake bowels (flashes and you miss them!), A few bloody wounds and a cut off arm, big deal. With an assumed budget of around $ 300,000, I admit the budget low, but I simply refuse to accept that to make such a garbage film there are lots of low budget horror flicks that make their modest budgets go a long way. It all looks like a home video, it has no style and is consistently gentle and boring to look at. The action also sucks, though you probably already knew it. Mexican werewolf in Texas will probably hire a few people / buy / see it because they might mistakenly believe it is a successor to John Landi's classic, which is certainly not & it's not even a proper Werewolf flick either. Don't be fooled by this is terrible and I'm tired of having to waste time / money on homemade amateur kits like this.
