Me and my brother are very big Asian movie fans, so when I found this movie hidden in a store, I bought this on DVD because it sounded very promising and I couldn't wait to see it. So I watched this movie with my brother, and I must say, in the beginning it was very promising. Both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I think it was all. There are some interesting games, but it is not an action movie that it claims to be. Instead, it's a love movie ... with clich√© of love so extremely played over the top, even Shakespeare would be vomited on this title. Sorry for my language. By the way: The characters seem to be retrieved from the street and given 100 ?? to play in this movie. Well, I and my brother saw it to the end because we thought it could only get better. But it never did. This movie challenged place # 1 on my and my brothers' "worst movie ever seen" list, followed only by "Fantasy mission force" - don't look at this either.
