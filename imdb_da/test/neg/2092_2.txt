"FOR THE DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that Blockbuster was getting a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Okay, maybe that's not what I said, but you get points. I didn't need to know who was in the movie or anything else. The only thing I knew was that I rented this movie. I should have asked what it was about. Eventually I don't know if I really would have seen a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give birth to snakes and make them spit out of their mouths. I also don't want to see a movie that has a guy who looks strangely like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> Anyway, while the curse may be interesting at some levels (well maybe not) there was still a promise that these annoying characters were eaten or at least killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit through the first hour with little more than a Texas Ranger, forcing a girl into a nice little titty pit so she can keep her cocaine or the Spanish shaman who likes to occasionally found people. But then the hell got loose and the girl started spitting more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So everything goes well at the end and I'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 meters long. After all, people are eaten, so that's all good. But then suddenly, and I won't tell you how it would ruin the best, one of the snakes is about 300 meters long. Then it continues to squeeze and consume the train, with all the graphics from Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately I couldn't make a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this movie. Anyways, so you'd think a big snake eating a train would be pretty unstoppable. Well, if you know your Maya voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. Yes that's all I want to say about it. <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Really bad for the point where you can be numb after seeing this or your brain can hurt. I didn't give this one, because no matter how stupid it was, it was still not as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or badly constructed B horror movies, this is for you. If you think this will actually be tough as its bigger, more infamous brothers, just go away from the box if you see it. And I want to leave you a quote from the movie that basically summarizes it all. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can't get on a train!" Because it's just stupid. Not as they make stops or anything ....
