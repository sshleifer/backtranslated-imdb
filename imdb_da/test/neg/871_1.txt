This film is the final straw. As two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy, this movie has finally realized that nothing good has come out of this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good about the movie at all. It was an affront to love, death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This movie took sparkle out of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane cannot act to save her life. She was convincing in her grin, crying and dancing. And she needs a better haircut. There is no need to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
