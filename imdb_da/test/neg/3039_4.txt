When a Stranger call belongs to the group of the year's remakes, with films like Poseidon just across the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helps this updated version with lots of relatively unknown casts that signal the death rate is high (it is not) or that established stars clearly steer from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> Clocking in a relatively short 87 minutes, it consists primarily of two actions. The first one to take a full one hour is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), chalked 800 minutes of talk time on his cell phone (low math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. To pay out her debt, she works part-time as a babysitter, and looking for the affluent Mandraki's children is the first step. The great Mandrakis mansion gets a complete tour treatment, as is where all the actions take place. Lots of rooms (makes it easy to hide), an indoor pool with aquarium pond (to get wet in, for the wet T-shirt treatment), and check out this - motion detector light that you just know will contribute to the scares with manipulation of light and shadows. Of course, prank call, red herring, is aplenty, which calculates at this action's runtime, but most fall flat in the voltage department. There is a minor tendency that arises as actors are invisible, giving and acting through their voice instead. Recent trials include Edward Norton of Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving's V of Vendetta. Here Lance Henriksen honors the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most of the calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature that I felt was wasted - they could also have thrown some unknowns instead, and the job would still be done. <br /> <br /> Another action where the main action takes place is too late. And the builder, it's just a bogeyman. Those who expect blood and gore will be disappointed as it is basically a one-woman show that keeps your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed) and this action will make her solve twice as fast time, raise Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Do not expect any kind of character development or subplotter that will involve. The end was trying to be too smart for his own benefit and came across as a cheap way to finish the movie. There is not much goodness to highlight from this movie - no scare, no excitement, no enigmatic villain and lots of security flaws, especially with the door alarm - the only thing that is good for is giving a number to 4D.
