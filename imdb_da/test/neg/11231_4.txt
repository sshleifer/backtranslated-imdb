A few years ago I remember reading an essay of a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of the "strong women" played by Rozzie R. lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (though he was not worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after seeing 'Passion Crime'. Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her depiction of prostitute China Blue. She is the subject of devotion to two men: The loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a boring whitebread boy whose marriage is slowly declining. And she won't let any of them have a piece of her until ... I don't want to give away the end - but I will say that this is ultimately among the Whitebread Boy's imagination. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he cannot pamper the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. Aside from its retrogressive class and gender policy, these old black and white movies look revolutionary in comparison.
