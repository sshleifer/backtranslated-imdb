Being a fan of the series, I thought how bad can the movie be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. Pete's character in the series was not a little baby portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music, and that Clare Danes is beautiful, was that it was short. What about the dance scene ??? The only reason I didn't go out of this movie was because it was so bad it was fun. Maybe it was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap 60's TV show is better than a 90-year-old $ 20 million movie. El Mariachi costs only $ 7,000 and is a much better movie. Don't waste your money when it comes to tape, it's not even worth renting.
