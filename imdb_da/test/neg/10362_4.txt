This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy', but don't be misled, it's not at all. There are hardly any weed-related jokes coming to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed medicine in this movie. The marijuana field is just a plot unit. My impression after watching this movie was that four friends got bored one summer and decided to write a script full of (their idea of) witty dialogue and making a movie. The product is bland dialogue supported by mediocre action, saying that this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement. Don't waste your time or money.
