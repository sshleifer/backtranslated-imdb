Misguided, miscast, creepy, interminable lunacy given high gloss MGM A budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who believes that the rich, beautiful man (Robert Taylor) is not a dream boat she married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is judged from the start of a treacherous, confused, ridiculous script and the idiotic casting of Hepburn as a threatened woman fearing for his life (who could ever imagine Hepburn afraid of something?) B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli that he was looking for a thriller, not a musical one. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, who is also resilient as a good guy, retains his dignity in a quiet, low-key performance. Karl Freund's hectic film creates images of eerie beauty - and was wasted on the wrong movie. The end result: The "Parnell" of the Metro from the 1940s.
