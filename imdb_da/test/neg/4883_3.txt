This movie is overrated, to say the least. It's not good as a comedy, nor is it good as a "serious" movie either. The pacings are far too plodding to the former, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. The only laugh comes from some of Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he gets annoyed by his brother's behavior. The headline is excellent, but the full-screen framing is appalling. (* 1/2)
