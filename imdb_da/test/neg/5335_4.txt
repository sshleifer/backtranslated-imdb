Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and appealing. Here she plays an actress who is terminally ill. We don't know what. It's a bit of a precursor to "Love Story" in that respect. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good as most of the supportive cast. John Payne is supposed to be grieving, but he seems to be sleeping.

It's a cute movie, but it doesn't feel sincere. I was hoping to move. I was at O'Hara's gentle performance. But I don't like to feel manipulated.
