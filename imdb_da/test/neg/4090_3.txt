This movie was a failure like comedy and a movie in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to try to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls into a shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> Sitting through this, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell didn't get more than a single really fun line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character becomes frequent, worthy lines, where they absolutely do not fit. <br /> <br /> Far from the glasses of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows all his record budget on special effects plots that hardly show up the plot. The film spends the first half on the construction of Evan's sheets, but in the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a mere ship for the stupid gags and even stupid messages. The film ends when we learn that the entire ark, the flood, and the animal collection were only a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God tried to influence politics.
