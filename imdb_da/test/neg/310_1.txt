The movie had no meaning to me at all. Good actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular favorite; he was fantastic in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but it was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director as opposed to the mediocre who did this effort), but terrible, foamy script , horrible editing, and a director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say and ended up saying something. Disturbing rubbish, but the kind of film that some Italian pseudo-intellectuals, as it was my misfortune to have known in the weak and distant past, would have loved it, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on these, they can be found anywhere and probably recognize this as a great masterpiece. I never thought much of Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first movie "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or such a title) in Rome, when it first appeared close to 50 years ago (I lived there for the time). All the usual pseudos raved about it, but it left me pretty cold. I didn't think he was much of a director then and still not. Age has certainly not improved him, and this film must rank as one of his worst.
