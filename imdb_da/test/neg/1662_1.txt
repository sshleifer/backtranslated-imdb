I couldn't see more than 10 minutes of this movie. It has set the standard. I will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as terrible as this one. I totally agree with the other comments about this movie. But since I am Dutch, I looked at Dutch translation. Apparently they didn't have the money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. With sometimes funny results. <br /> <br /> Don't smoke, don't drink, don't take drugs, don't see Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I just said it.) Don't hold the script (Was there anyone?) in their hands while recording. I also think they've done a good job on ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they didn't do well at all.
