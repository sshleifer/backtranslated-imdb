There is a reason why the world forgot these creatures: they are boring. This is a Hammer production, which means that who made this movie should be hit with a hammer, several times if possible - and where it hurts most. Most people think more about taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie. <br/> <br /> Seriously now ?? The film begins with some hollow men looking at antelope. Now antelopes must have evolved a lot from prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here. Then it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models and even a couple of very old gray-haired neighbors and grandpas. Of course, these old fireballs have never heard of caves that do not exceed the age of 30. they refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistoric records, so that they remain alive. One of the hollow men is not the beard; he is cut off. Not quite as sharp as Tarzan, the Lord of the humanoid, clean-shaven Ones, roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but so on. What follows is the mandatory earthquake / melted lava destruction sequence that causes many of our non-hairy friends to meet their deaths. It is interesting to note that the fashion models before the earthquake showed their breasts more. After that, they must have been shy or something because they covered their coffins for a while (maybe they were covered in ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). Several actions follow in the form of two fashion models that break in the sand; The second best thing about women's mud wrestling, I suppose. After much of the desert is crossed, our black-haired tribe - how could it be - meets a blond tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> More spell binding things follow. There is the red-haired fashion model bothered by seeing a cave teen kill a hedge-hog thing. There is also the scene for a woman who dies at birth: the cave-fashion models are so fragile. Finally, we come to meet an even darker-haired and shiny tribe, that is, an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats (!) A big bear in a wrestling. 1,2,3 ... and that's done: the bear is loser. We are also witnessing that a jealous hollow man miraculously restored from two major injuries: first he is stabbed with a large spit in his thigh, but he walks away from it as if it were only a scratch. Then he is thrown by a rock - on a large rock - by the blonde candy-two-shoe cave, but he walks away from it as if he were thrown on a huge sofa. It is unclear in the end whether he dies from falling from an even higher rock or from the voodoo doll being crushed. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes living in the desert and whose women were fashion models. It is always important to learn from movies. The film's message is so obvious as it is educational: Hole people liked to fight for local power, and they also loved their fashion models. As if a self-respecting rider would struggle to be the leader of such a sorry one.
