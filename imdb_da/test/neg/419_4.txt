I went to watch this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I was hoping to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were significant differences from the book, as did the changes made to the DiVinci code. I went to see the DiVinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the movie, despite the changes from the book. It was still fun, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, angels and demons disappointed at almost every level. Throughout the film there are symbols and are calculated quickly without any interest to the viewer. They are blowing past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative in the book, was replaced with the crossed key symbol. It was, in my opinion, a chance to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which Langdon's character is about. Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails when trying to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10
