Man with screaming brain is a story of greed, fraud and revenge in the small Bulgarian city. William Cole, wealthy industrial, wins up with a portion of his brain replaced by a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different, but they shared one thing - both were killed by the same woman. William and Yegor brought back an unlikely partnership to the life of a mad scientist who tracks their common nemesis. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen but behind the lens. Unfortunately this time, the laughs do not live, and Campbell must resort to what he does best to try to fill the gap in this movie. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and characters I hoped for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after watching this movie before the purchase, I am happy that I do not have the "pleasure" of adding it. <br /> <br /> The movie goes wrong in history, which at first glance seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boringly pulled out dribbling. It is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy really doesn't hit it, it just makes us scratch our heads. It looks like Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen ... he's fighting for him. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the movie really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have followed these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, why I felt compelled to suffer this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell has experience as an instructor from managing episodes of the television series Hercules is evident. Campbell does the film work well, even with the low budget. In the end, there are not so many things going for this that you would hope for, but Campbell's fans will stay behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I don't want to.
