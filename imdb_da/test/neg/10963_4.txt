Finally, Quick and Undead is the first movie that actually makes its own story zero and empty. It is essentially a giant plot hole. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the play was pretty bad, character motives that were not existing or incredible, and there was not a single character worth hanging on our hat. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential for being a dark horse characteristic) got sniffed halfway through the negotiations. <br /> <br /> What Quick and Undead serve as an excellent example of how to make good color timing. It seems to be excellent when considering budgetary considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a guy seems to have got his hands on a hundred grand and looked at some westerns (especially The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then just throw a lot of items into a movie ... "you know they have movies where characters do this! Do this fit? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies, so I should do it here!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps a good view of budding filmographers and color doctors (first-year film schoolers). Otherwise, a must-miss.
