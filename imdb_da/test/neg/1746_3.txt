Let's see. This movie is many things to different people. For Finnish, as stated in the comments, it can be OK or terrible or boring. For other people, it can be something different. Firstly, if you do not speak Finnish (I do), you understand half of what is going on, because subtitles are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly ("Paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as Badlands in UK English) . <br /> <br /> Why couldn't I like it? Because it is a Tarantino style movie: It just takes a very hard reality and throws it back on you as brutally as possible. However, I am not American, and therefore I am not particularly fond of this procedure because all it does is show that the director has nothing new to say. Technical skill (camera work is brilliant), script (not the original) does not save this movie from the bottom where it belongs. Should you wish to watch a Finnish movie, go to any of Kaurism√§ki brothers' films that match talent and director skills with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intent and priorities: no one was understandable, and so this movie succeeded. By not seeing it, you will not miss much.
