So this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It's up there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if you're a bad movie fan I am, this horror in a movie will be the funniest thing you've had this year. Why does the camera make Kung Fu sounds in old-school when it zooms? Why does the random guy eat a nascar plaque in his bag? And who is he anyway? Why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? So what! Just laugh at it. This movie has no continuity, no plot, no, really. Ron Hall's feelings are always off. He looks happy when he is sad, angry when he is confused. The rest of the roll could not get out of a paper bag. The special ("Short Bus" kind of special) effects are randomly placed and never needed. Most scenes are turned on with a table lamp if they are switched on at all. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to watch off-camera to its line and it's not even edited out. They continue to film. In fact, half of this movie is not even on film at all. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 sony hand-cam. Most of the movie seems to have left their homeland at home. This movie has not just a few plot holes, it's a memory of confusion and mental pain! But I love it! Thanks Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it because it's just so amazing fun. ($ 1.99 on Amazon and I had it hurry!) <br /> <br /> "I have weapons! I have weapons! I have weapons!"
