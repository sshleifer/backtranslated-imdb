Isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on Cartoon Network is aimed at girls? Although I don't see soldiers being shot and blown up to save Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on TV I could see to satisfy my violent forces. And something I would not have done fun to see. I saw some episodes (I really should be shot at this) and had to sit through the movie (now where do I find a gun?), And it is clear that this lost its spark after the first episodes. If you like to see 500 foot monsters that can destroy big cities in seconds, being slaughtered by toddlers about a foot tall, this is a must-see. But it gets very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become mostly boring. The movie just felt like a prolonged episode (I can't remember any of that), and the villain should have been far more scary than a green monkey. This show is a laugh. It churns out the same basic premiere episode after the episode after episode, and although it might try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "Powerpuff Girls Save the Day!" Everything is good and good, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 to be the only danged comic on CN to revolve around violence, even though it is aimed at girls so I want to Don't vote for it ever. I have established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I will not get that reputation destroyed ... 3/10
