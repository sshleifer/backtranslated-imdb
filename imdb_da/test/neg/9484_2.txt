A silly movie with a stupid plot. Feels like they threw all possible cliches into a blender. I especially "looked" the part where two teenage girls make the French President clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to preserving the environment. Kyoto, anyone ?? And the French chef, who apparently never saw or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think the Americans have no culture. It and the fact that we meet your children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two ditsy preteens in this movie, but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.
