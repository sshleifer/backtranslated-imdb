Highest Sanction is a movie about a female assassin working for the US government. She must kill a known TV rep but save her life when she sees that he has a small daughter. Because she has not killed him, she becomes the next target for her employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not good even though I've seen worse B movies. A warrior with remorse, the government kills innocent people in the fight against terror ... What is next? Aliens rescue victim ??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win any prize because of the script. And the play is no better, I'm afraid. A few better-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson) who obviously had many bills to pay and therefore agreed to play in this movie with some other actors who may not even know what a camera really looks like it does either nothing for the movie. <br /> <br /> So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do, but to see some action girl and you are tired of the 10.531th object of Mc Gyver or the A team, it may be the movie you want to see. Otherwise you give it better alone. I give it a 3/10.
