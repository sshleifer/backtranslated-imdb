We brought this movie as a joke to a friend and could have been our worst joke to play. The film is almost unavailable, and the play is fierce. The worst children's actor ever used, and Hasslehoff gives a substandard performance. The reason is shameful and on points we were so bored we wondered what the hell was going on. It's trying to be cruel in places, but is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just awful
