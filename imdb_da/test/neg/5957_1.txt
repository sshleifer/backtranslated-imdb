SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was rented as a joke and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for El Chupacabra. The dog catching outfit is so ridiculous. It looks as if he sewed the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a car that is heavily illuminated and they run in pitch black. You can often see the camera's shadow on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is awful, and the play is terrible. This is a good movie to laugh ... maybe.
