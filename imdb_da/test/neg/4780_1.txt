The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie "The Ruins" is the final credits that indicate comedian Ben Stiller as one of the leading manufacturers. What did Stiller think when he sank his bucks in this cooler about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on his victims and consumes them. Oscar nominee scenarios Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan" that adapts his own bestselling story, sticks to the standard clichés and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas, where ruthless youths do everything, but sign signals beg for evil forces to eat them. Were Cretan characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we are being treated to yet another movie where American tourists are in danger simply because they are Americans. In addition, unlike really good horror movies explaining why the monsters need to feed, the "ruins" do not give any explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its crooked vines. <br /> <br /> The setup for "The Ruins" resembles the 2006 horror movie "Turistas", where slimy South Americans captured brainless American backpackers and harvested them to their internal organs. In fact, "Turistas" generated some legitimate tensions and chills. The "ruins" do not interfere with either excitement or chills. A vicious mastiff who suddenly sneaks on the camera to talk to our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. The rest of "The Ruins" borrows from another movie: "The Descent", an amazing 2006 cooler of a bunch of babes thrown into a nightmare experience when they are lost in the warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other films, which also deliberately or accidentally served, also came to mind. They are the just 1968 Hammer horror classic "The Lost Continent" of murderous vegetation that threatens innocent spectators in a sea of ​​abandoned ships and the Roger Corman cult class "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) on a New York florist who growing a "ruins" unfold in the scenic, sunny Mexico, where four frolicking American college children, Eric (Shawn Ashmore from the "X-Men" films), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Pact"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of " Sleepers "and Amy (Jena Malone of" Pride & Prejudice ") wraps their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses an award-winning earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful teutonic, twentysomething tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copying Beethoven") recovers it and the group embraces him as the newest best friend. These people live to party and they already have friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his colorful brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a distant majestic pyramid not mentioned in any guidebook. He offers to take them with him and they accept. <br /> <br /> First piece of horror movie: If no one knows about the place where you go, you will help avoid it. When they only have one day left and they have not done any adventurous, our two couples, together with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check out the pyramid. They take a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their card and warns them to stay away. Second Rule of Horror Movie: When the natives warn you to control, you control. A sharp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he takes them out to their destination, and he does so in heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Previously, our heroes have found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of the Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without a nausea when he tries to remove their fears. The remaining protagonists shrink security at the top of the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Finally vines jump out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, the "Ruins" become "Bug", the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid film about insects that come under your skin. Before long, our heroes change each other into a vain effort to extract vines under their skin. A particularly cruel scene shows Americans easing the German guy's legs to save his life. For comparison, it makes the torture of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. <br /> <br /> The "ruins" are just like another burgundy break with nothing to redeem it.
