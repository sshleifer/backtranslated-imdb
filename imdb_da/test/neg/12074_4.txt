This movie follows the life of a great guitarist who wants to make it big, but acts almost irresponsibly for self-destruction. I expected the usual Woody Allen witty dialogues, sarcasm and humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" failed to give. The protagonist, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He's so unbearable that I don't want him or worry about him. I wonder why a movie about him should be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the movie a horrible drill. Even Sean Penn's great play fails to revive the movie to a visible level. <br /> <br /> I like Woody Allen's movie a lot, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
