I have to agree with the previous reviewer: This movie has a great animation but has problems in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Plot holes are huge, the dialogue only explains the concepts of the plot - THE MAIN PLOTS are not even fully explained until the last five minutes of the movie. The characters indicate the obvious, but fail to explain the more confusing points in the movie. There are signs that appear and have significance in history, which are never explained - most of them have names that are only mentioned * once *, and that is extremely confusing to a viewer. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is.
