Like other movies from the worst director ever, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but because of that it is also very fun. Don't be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? As a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher. The movie is trying to explain what a transvestite is, and it does so through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) talking to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things. The doctor tells detective two stories, and that is what we and apparently the researcher see. The doctor counts these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the newsletter about a sex change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) who is in love and must marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he never told her he likes to dress like a woman when he is called Glenda . The film tells the same thing over and over, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily homosexual. The movie almost says it's not a bad thing to be a transvestite, but being gay is telling us that a transvestite is not gay. The second story is about a transvestite that really wants a sex change and doesn't just want to dress like a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A few things make this movie very bad and therefore ridiculous. How the story is presented is the first thing, the way in which the same things are told over and over, and all of this is the end of others. This is not where it ends. The action is very poor, especially Dolores Fuller seems to read his lines directly from a small screen somewhere. Every thing she says is fun. The whole dialogue gave me some laughs. <br /> <br /> There is also an order in which someone enters a room. The door remains half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not quite straight. So the door, in what seems to be the same shot, even though we don't know, is a little less open, and suddenly the case hangs on the wall straight. Ed Wood did not mind leaving this kind of continuity error in his movie. Can be a good thing, because it is basically just another laugh for the modern audience. I think you understand that this is a bad movie and I think there is a good chance that you are also laughing at the ridiculous mistakes.
