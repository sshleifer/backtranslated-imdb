The first time I saw this movie I was ten years old. I thought it was bad then, and at that age I had no cinematic taste at all. I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and unpleasant. There is no way that the protagonist will ever fall in love with her. The witnesses were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t. soap opera !! I'm glad I didn't watch this movie at the theater or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who have to endure seeing it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
