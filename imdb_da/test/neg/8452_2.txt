This is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is performed very badly. I am a fan of kids and thumbs and many other so-called teen anxiety movies, but this bugged me. <br /> <br /> Why is every white child made for a chew who loves rap, it becomes one-dimensional. the play was terrible but simple, as it consisted of just dropping a bomb after a bomb, just a bad movie if you want to watch better movies like this: thumb sucker kids bully all <br /> <br /> those i think are better so i recommend one of them if you want to see a good "teen movie" i hope my comment you found helpful and hope you hear future comments from me
