And again, Columbia Pictures only decides to make "hash" using the original Curly version and without any of the gags or jokes to boot! At the end of this pitiful flick when Joe gets stuck on the bull, the studio did not even attempt to resume the sound, because if you listen carefully, you can still here curl up "Woo woo woo woo". Also, when Moe and Larry throw the darts to "put the bull down so he can get rid of" that is lifted straight from the original because you can actually see that Moe and Larry "magically" appear 15 years younger. Why oh why did Moe do all this? It is a burning issue that can probably never be answered, as far as I know, in fact, he was quite sensitive to any kind of criticism and had quite high standards for his work, like Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste your time on this one.
