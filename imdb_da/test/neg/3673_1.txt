This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, beside any plot, and the plot it has is very scattered. The story lacks both content, excitement and subtitles as it seems to be the story in Russian. The set seems to be just one room with different light effects, and the moment you think something good is happening, you are let down by the total lack of acting, drama, excitement, horror, gore, history and mythology. The directional style has been made to death (The Fisheye Camera). It seems that the only action in this movie is within the last 10-15 minutes, and the action gets worse by the players' inability to portray the tension correctly. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog ​​barking on surround sound.
