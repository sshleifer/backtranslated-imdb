This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe people actually a) write scripts like this b) get a budget to make a movie c) actually expect it to be a success. Words can't even describe how horrible this movie is. I enjoy my fair share of teenage movies, but it didn't even come close to being fun. In fact, it was fun for the only reason that it was so terrible. I can count on one (maybe two) parts in the movie where I even managed to squeeze out a chuckle (except for the laughs about how bad it was). Renting this was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made It's been a day since I've seen the movie and I'm still in shock as to how terrible it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
