This is a known fact, Mr Seagal can't smile, he can shop, he can kick ass, there are weak smiles, no real smiles, no laughs loud and not really point to see this confusing movie. We see an overweight, Mr. Seagal as Dr. Wesley Maclaren, in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter Ayako, has stated as his office assistant. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives in another darn outback with his cute daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelets and at the other end of the city some predominantly military leaders decide to make the whole city ill by spreading a virus that is moving in the air and killing a 2-day question that thinks he can survive as he had an antidote. Problems, there is no antidote and the one that exists keeps the virus back for a while. The CIA is contacted and even they cannot help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter Holly. So she gets chased and believes that healing is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab her daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is native Native American. Together with her sister-in-law Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure, but even the soldiers die slowly and others will if they do not find a cure in time. And to shorten the moment neither Ann nor Wesley is infected by the virus ... hmm. A weak fight scene. Terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stairwell.
