Cheerleader Massacre was to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; If that was what they were doing (as it is considering an actress from the original returns in a small cameo role), they have failed miserably and made the worst of the quadrilogy. Cheerleader Massacre combines incompletely bad acting, a horrible plot, a stupid killer, boring and boring deaths, boring scenery and fierce camera work to make it one of the worst movies ever made. Have I already mentioned how bad it was? Don't make me wrong: this scary and delayed excuse for a horror movie is not nearly as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undoubtedly a horrible movie. Cheerleader Massacre is a precise polar opposite of Original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is complete garbage!
