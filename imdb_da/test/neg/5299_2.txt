"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - people finally got Elmore Leonard right and made good movies out of work. So, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, I couldn't resist renting it. I thought how bad could it be? Oy, which error, especially on the heels of reading the book, which was lamb (and also circularly self-referring) to the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. Still, the book was better than the movie. Leonard again threatens the weak and unskilled screenwriters who are trying to take over his book. The dialogue written to Steven Tyler was painful to see. And the lyrics of the character Linda Moon's first song? My middle schoolers write with more depth. Sad, sad, sad. Why even give it a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to watch on the screen, Andre 3000 did not make a complete fool of himself.
