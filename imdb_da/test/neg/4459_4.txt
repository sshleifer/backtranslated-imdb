Although I had the form of enjoying SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I knew I should not expect too much of its even more malignant predecessor! Surely the smallest of Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes as far as calling it studio's nadir!) The film truly abounds because of its complete unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - update the myth the modern setting really suits SATANIC RITES quite better) ... even though the truth is told, it is still much preferable to draw as Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee's fierce bashing of the movie, he still cuts an unimaginable striking figure like the undead vampire (though he looks very little and is inexplicably limited to a setting); Similarly, Peter Cushing delivers his usual committed performance. The only other notable play in the movie is that given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - even though it is only because of how incredibly hammy it is! Unfortunately, the two most well-known female members of the cast (both scammers) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - cannot rise above their physical characteristics. <br /> <br /> The camera work is by Dick Bush (who had shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and for Hammer, then DINOSAURS REGULED EARTHEN [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but perhaps best known for his long-standing relationship with Ken Russell, who manages some good mood throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage shift on (really gothic) beginnings; the hysterical Black Mass sequence followed by revival of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushings Van Helsing.
