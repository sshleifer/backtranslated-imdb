Where in hell did the VH1 find the scriptwriter for this movie ??? Out of high school? This movie is trying so hard to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but instead he turns him into a horrible, sticky caricature. All lines are filled with clich√©s, but surprisingly the play was not bad. As usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor playing Michael Jackson, jeez, I'm sorry about him! I think he did the best he could with the weak script. I didn't mind that Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best he could, but later on he had all the white makeup on, oh man, so he was out! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that the actor, who plays Liz Taylor, looked too young and healthy to play Liz. The actor, who plays Diana Ross, didn't look like her at all, and I couldn't figure out who this woman was until much later in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie makes a bad service for anyone on the Michael Jackson side or against Michael Jackson. It doesn't matter to change one's opinion. In fact, the only statement someone wants after watching this movie, oh God, this movie really sucks really! And where in the hell is Michael Jackson wonderful music and songs? There is no one in this movie. I still love the soundtrack to this movie, and I'll probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> On the easier side, this is a very fun, camp movie! It's a good time if you want to see some light that won't disturb your brain too much. I'll probably see it again because it's just so entertaining bad!
