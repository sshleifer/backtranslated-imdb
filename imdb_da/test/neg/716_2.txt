Of all the Perry Mason movies since 1985 I have seen, this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> I admit that I never wanted Diana Muldaur as an actress. She only seems to know how to play a kind of character - a hard-bitten career woman with an indefinite chip on her shoulder, which is why it is extremely difficult to sympathize with in any way. This is no exception - it is true to form. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only thing that saves this movie is a serious performance by Scott Baio as the prosecutor - I actually found myself rooting for him to win and the movie is worth seeing for him alone.
