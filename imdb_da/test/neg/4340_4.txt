The only thing in "Sudden Death" that exhausts the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of plot holes. What about it, and the sheer amount of contrivances, one could hardly call what's left a story. To say that the manuscript borrowed from "Die Hard" would be to make the world's most obvious understatement! <br /> <br /> Here we have a restless hero working in the great Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a fire Marshall. At night in the finals series seventh game he gets tickets so he can treat his alien children to the decisive game and of course spend some time with them. Also catch the fight, but for political reasons is the vice president of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a bunch of incredibly well-organized mercenaries capture VP's box and demand hundreds of millions in government money, our hero Darren McCord has more than just made his plans. <br /> <br /> Every time a new one of these formal flicks has made it seem that everything we get in the way of innovation, nasties are bad guys and more and more spectacular and cruel ways the good guys dispose of them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top (not that this is an original sin) to make us fake the evil terrorists. The horrible bad guys are about shooting the secret service, security and civilians (both old and young) with gay surrender and with little regard to the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme engages in lots of fisty cuffs and gunplay, heroics and death defying stunts. The script asks a little about the muscular European. Almost everyone else has walk-ons apart from Powers Boothe, who seriously exaggerates his under written, low-key role as the cruel, best old ringleader ever. <br /> <br /> There is very clever movie and enough explosive special f / x to keep anyone awake. But really, that's all this action flick has, action. Although there are some nifty sequences, nothing can be called outrageously brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
