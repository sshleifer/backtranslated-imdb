I was an extra on this movie, but wish I wasn't because its rubbish. The worst thing about this movie is the music, but plays, scripts, editing, directing and history are also terrible. The main reason is that it is bad because the budget is so low, and the only way to make good movies on a low budget is to have a good script. The script that should have been torn up before the movie was made is not fun, I didn't even laugh. What made me laugh is how decision makers probably think the most important thing was to get the movie done, who cares about its total nonsense. The film needed about Â£ million more budget and a better author. The only reason I didn't give the movie one in ten is because I was sorry the guy who will lose a few hundred grand who does this if you go and see it, just make sure that your drunk at that time. ha ha
