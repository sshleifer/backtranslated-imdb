Almost everything Stephen King has ever written seems to have been transformed into a movie or television series; In fact, I am surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. Let's see if they did, it couldn't be less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of the King's many short stories, this 1984 horror sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton flick on playing a couple on a long road trip that runs into a nuisance when they drive in it sleepy Nebraska town of Gatlin, where all adults have been murdered by children who worship an old evil who lurks in the cornfields. <br /> <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch manages to build a reasonable atmosphere in the beginning (after Hamilton's stupid song and dance, but before we meet the freakish isak, the head of the killer children), he completely hits it endlessly effortless scenes where Hamilton and Horton are chased by the city's homicidal half-points. Courtney Gains, as violent red-haired Malachai, manages to seem real threatening, but the rest of the kids are not least threatening; as a result, many of the film's "scary" moments fail to function. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, when we finally see the vicious force around the Gatlin area, the film falls into the glory of the horrible 80s visual effects that are likely to be so beautiful almost 25 years ago, but looks positively ridiculous today. <br /> <br /> Kids in the corn may be interesting to the king's fans who are eager to see how the author's work has been translated into the big screen, but your average horror movie fan will be most unimpressed.
