I had to watch this for my Canadian movie theater and I was told it was considered the "best Canadian movie". When I saw this, I really didn't agree to having seen much better. I understand that there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and plot were so interrupted with me (as a spectator) didn't make me really concerned about what the movie was trying to tell me. The reason was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but it is to emphasize the messages so as not to cross the crowd. This movie shows a little about Quebec's history. Not a very interesting movie; it certainly does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal.
