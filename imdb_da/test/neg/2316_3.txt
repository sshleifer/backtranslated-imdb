"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb would allow one-word reviews, that's what mine would be. This movie was originally intended for children only and it seems to be very difficult for adults or older children to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is boring and washed out - like this public domain print. Like other comedy films with roots in traditional children's stories (like the horrible SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overstated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and is just as old. Now when I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children today would even find this movie enjoyable! So my advice is NOT see this movie. To watch an Abbott and Costello movie, almost any other of their movies (except A & C GO TO MARS) will be an improvement.
