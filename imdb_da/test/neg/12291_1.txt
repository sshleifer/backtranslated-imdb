I'm sorry, but I can't understand what people are smoking when they wrote how big they thought "Ethan Mao" was. I've seen better acting, character and plot development in porn! WARNING: I will give away a key element to the "plot". After keeping his family friend overnight, Ethan lets his evil, evil, hated tribal mother go to the bank - ALL !!! - to retrieve that part of his lazy mum's jewelry that he so desperately wants. Guess what? She's calling the police! Wow ... what a twist! I couldn't see it coming at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Clean, unadulterated waste!
