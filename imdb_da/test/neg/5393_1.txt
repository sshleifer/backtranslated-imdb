Like many, this deep-eye caught my eyes while I was on channel surfing. It is a horror movie lying in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he has been part of some great horror flags, I know he wouldn't wrong me .. Ugh! The most offensive part of this is that I actually looked at it. I see the director Johnny Martin is a stuntman. Well, this stunt stinks and how he got some of the actors to do this watery stool is the biggest mystery for everyone ... I can understand Casper Van Dien, but shame on you. Rooker. Your good name in the horror community has always been tarnished, and your agent must be fired immediately. I'm sure this nugget of fecal material is available on DVD, but if you enjoy the .99 cents menu at McDonalds, you'll get more for your money there.
