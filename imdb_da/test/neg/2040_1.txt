An art student in Rome possesses ... or something. She has dreams of being nailed to a cross, and Satan herself raps her. He holds her (I think) and makes her a sex addict. It's about everything I could take and I knocked it off. <br /> <br /> A meaningless "Exorcist" rip off. I caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified ... and not in a good way! This movie should be a horror movie, but will be nothing more than a sex movie spoiled as a horror movie. There are tons of pointless female nudity and the actor leading the lead must break down more than once. We see her being raped by Satan (a handsome guy), masturbating and coming to his own father ... Must give her points for courage. Add to the bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), miserable plays and a story that almost doesn't make sense. The one disruptive order (her nailed to the cross) almost works, but the miserable "special" effects destroy it. This is one of the few horror movies that was so bad I stopped watching. Skip it over.
