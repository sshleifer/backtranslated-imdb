Maybe it will be better. I wouldn't know. I did it through the first twenty minutes or so before I cut it and came in for a period of grief. It was obvious that the plot itself was known. A man, Paul LeMatt, professor of entymology in Columbia, runs his dog to a small town in Ohio looking for his former wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who either ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but something happens. <br /> <br /> This kind of event is home to movie producers and viewers, and it is pregnant with opportunities. You can show a nicely pronounced commercial success as "Bad Day at Black Rock." Or it would have, and probably did, a good "Twilight Zone" episode. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes some experienced artists as well as some prominent names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, is the superficially gracious motel leader. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance as she did in saying "Silkwood." For some of the others, their reach is limited. <br /> <br /> But it's poorly directed and shabbily written. <br /> <br /> Example of shabby direction. The dog of LeMatt is not like Kenneth Toby, just outside the bats. So when LeMatt goes out into the street, Toby sneaks up the window in his room, looks in at the dog, and some zaps. Cut to LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog shining away. Then a POV shot of the presumably dog ​​zipping along towards LeMatt then past him while the wind is blowing and LeMatt gawks on the camera. Cut for an identical shot - coming from the other direction! No matter what the camera represents, whatever LeMatt is staring at, never appears. Maybe it wasn't something because suddenly the wind stops, and LeMatt is alone in the street and looks a little confused. "You should never have brought that dog in the first place," notes a smiling Toby from the front porch. Question: What the hell is this scene about? <br /> <br /> Example of shabby writing. Well, two examples. (1) If you were to sit down and write a stereotype waitress in a small town dining room without exercising any craft, you would come up with an expressive child with her hair stacked on top of her head, chewing gum, sauntering among the tables. Right. (2) Everything that looks like credibility is thrown into the window for special effects. LeMat's car stops and explodes while waiting to be secured in the garage. Chugging to an end: trustworthy. Exploding: Supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would join such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece like "Invasion of Body Snatchers." Something goes wrong in Dr. Kevin McCarthy's small town, and it takes half of the movie for the mystery to be unraveled, and all the time the excitement builds and doubts grow. Here, twenty minutes into the movie, a stranger enters a motel room and tears of his plastic surface and reveals a vibrant, luminous, naked brain. Pregnancy is interrupted. <br /> <br /> I don't want to tell you the end because I don't know what it is and don't care. I suppose it had something to do with insects because why would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who handles his classes?) But I'm not even sure there were any errors involved. It is quite possible that the error business was unintentional. The authors may have made him an insect specialist and then forgot about it. It wouldn't surprise me.
