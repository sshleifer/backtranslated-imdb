Need for work, the right man Bud Abbott (like Jack) and comedian partner Lou Costello (like Dinkel) get the latter a pram job, independently described "problem child" David Stollery (like Donald). Young Stollery winds up reading Mr. Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title) that puts Costello to sleep and dreams that he and Mr. Abbott relives the story of "Jack and the Beanstalk" (you guessed it). <br /> <br /> The Sepia tone changes to color for most of the production. It was apparently an attempt at something else for the duo, a colorful children's imagination. It fails, but here you come to see Abbott & Costello in color, silent movie star William Farnum (like the wife) does her last performance a little, boxing Max Baer's brother Buddy and Stollery before Disney's "Spin and Marty". <br /> <br /> ** Jack and Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
