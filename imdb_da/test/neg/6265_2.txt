Stop me, if you're hard here before, some cheerleaders, their coach and a few guys are trapped in a cabin in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. Shame on me after I completely wrote by Jim Wynorski after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it was a long time to come when his last really good movie was 1990's "Hard to Die"), for some reason I got the hope on a supposed successor to "Slumber Party Massacre". Unfortunately, my mediocre expectations were not met. This excursion is almost as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes I include SPM 2 that should tell you something) Besides, how can you get a slasher movie with this little gore ??? I mean Come on now !! <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ricky Ray gets topless; April Flowers and Charity Rahmer shows breasts and buns in a shower scene (April being naked again later in the movie) and Tamie Sheffield gets topless and barber balls
