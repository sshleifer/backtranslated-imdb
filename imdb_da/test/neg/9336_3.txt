Solomon and Sheba have come down in Hollywood, not for the quality of the movie, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while he did. I was in 5th grade and well remember the great news for days when this tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and appreciated his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had an opinion on this movie and what a dud it turned out. He was also the named producer of this. Maybe he just wouldn't meet the critics. Good thing Power actually went out with witness to the prosecution even though you can see him on long shots if you look closely. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stew that would probably baffle the great Solomon himself. Several events described in the Bible that the Bible deals with separately are interwoven in one plot with a few additions thrown in by Hollywood. The actual story of the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, chatted to Solomon, came back with many merchandise and that was it. The story of a romance between her and salomon is the legend. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is about where Yemen is now and her people allegedly moved to the African continent, which is how Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The Queen never witnessed Solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate requirements for a baby, nor was she involved in the construction of the first temple. She wasn't around to destroy the same. For that matter, neither was Solomon. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when Solomon's brother Adonijah filed a counterclaim. It's the heart of this movie. Adonija, after hearing the news that King David is dying, declares himself king. Of course, David temporarily ranks and says that God came to him and said that Solomon would succeed him. When David hears about what Adonija did, he says that what God has bent out of shape, Adonijah is greedy. Then Adonijah comes to plot. It seems to come full circle because Ty Power collapsed on the set while dueling with George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, especially in Lloyds of London, which was Power's breakthrough role. If Sanders is not quite sophisticated he was in Samson and Delilah, he is still Sander's biblical cad. When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought in to play Salomon and got a wig so that the existing recording of Kraft in long shot could be saved. Brynner invests the dialogue with the right dignity, but I think he has probably complained about getting that headache. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and she is prolonged as a biblical temptress in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition. She doesn't seem to have any real conviction, and my guess is that she was shocked at Power's sudden death and having to do it all over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> The real story with Adonijah is not as comprehensive as this movie. He disputed with Salomon for the legacy and gathered around a group of King David's court as followers. Solomon preached them once, and then Adonijah prayed for Abishag in marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adoptive daughter of King David at his age. When Solomon hears it, he decides Adonijah to be greedy again and kill him. The Bible mentions a person named Berniah who walked around and basically made contractual terms on Adonijas followers. <br /> <br /> What we have in the movie is a spectacular climax that involves a miracle I sought and couldn't find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor, who ended a long and prominent career on a sour note. It was a question of Vidor trying to do Cecil B. DeMille in biblical plays. <br /> <br /> He didn't.
