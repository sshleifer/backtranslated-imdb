Current? Safe. Entertainment? Probably - but only by removing the sailor from the sense of the senses. Reality? Only in so much that it was made on this planet. Where thousands of people were to die because of a 5 meter water volume in a city that was liberally filled with buildings exceeding 25 meters high is right over me. Carlyle's line to the effect of "How can anyone survive it?" When the shot shows the forests of multi-storey buildings over the water, it is quite ridiculous. If someone commits to an area (underwater) where an air cylinder is not enough (ie they must die), why not use the simple intent to take more than one cylinder? It is clear that the author believes that in stressful situations people cannot count beyond one (a cylinder, a floor). <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this tripe, you would be more informed and entertained by throwing away the DVD and reading the pricing on the outer cellophane cover. <br /> <br /> Nice, truly pathetic and a terrible waste of talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the sexist propaganda that suggests that only women can look through the problems to elucidate the solutions to be done by the consumable men: even more PC tosh. Little wonder that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other such films with little or no profit will always have a subsequent while this blatantly politically motivated bilge peddled.
