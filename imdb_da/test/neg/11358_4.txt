I'm a big fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be the feeling of solidarity and a need to survive. This movie focused more on a "let's just do the gory" view. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of bad actors and even worse special effects. When the zombies come out of the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just splashing out of the hole. I did not realize that holes in avian floors blew so much. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst play I've ever seen when she woke up and began to get sick. I laughed pretty hard when she died. Deserved it in every way. I was a little confused as to why Dr. Kelly could speak after being a zombie, but then there was nothing said by another zombie, because annoying screams and tremors. And they seemed to kill the zombies quite effectively by shooting them in the stomach, but when Dr. Bennett is expelled from the plane and into the engine, removing most of its lower half, he is still able to live at the end. <br /> I felt they changed things to make a "good" scene. When one of the bitchy girlfriends (I didn't take the time to learn their names. They played a meaningless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to see Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror on a plane (mishap and all that), but I doubt there is so much space behind with the insane room in the real bathroom and everyone. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the few redeeming qualities were too late. One thing the movie was about to be was the smoky airplane, but they felt the need to kill everything, but once. And I will admit that I laughed hard when the old lady crumbles down on Frank's arm, and he says, "She gums me to death" or something to that extent. Honestly, I'm sad I wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it minors rejects it, but still ... It failed on so many levels. Stick to the day of the dead and 28 days later.
