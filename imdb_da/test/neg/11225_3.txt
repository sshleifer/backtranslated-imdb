I found this movie to be preaching and unrealistic. It is trying to be a movie that shows the children fighting against the system, but it does not even provide a positive solution. I don't think I really felt for the kids. I can fully understand what their grip was and I know how poor the schools are, but I found their solution and the way outside treated it to be a big bunch of phooey. If this comes on TV, don't waste your time. Watch Short Circuit again for the 235 time.
