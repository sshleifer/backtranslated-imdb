I like a lot of Myrna Loy movies. This movie was produced before her character actor personality was developed. It would be an okay short film, but seems to go on forever forever in its complete form. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to be telling you what to do with her acting and doing the job. It's all about everything you can say about her. <br /> <br /> Her gypsy character is lukewarm and the movie has many flaws such as. Jewelry shop scene. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably be interesting for Myrna Loy fans, but even as such is a disappointment.
