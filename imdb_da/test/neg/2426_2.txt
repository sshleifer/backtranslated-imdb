This movie is horrible. The action is cheesy and ridiculous. If you know anything about Rugby, the fighting action is boring. Any episode of the Power Rangers actually contains more realism than this movie. The 'action' consists of no more than one pass and a shot of the guy lands over the attempt line or gets tackled without the ball and frantic handheld shots of who knows what. It is impossible to tell. There is nothing of the excitement, skill, and construction of sample scoring that true rugby contains. In terms of chin, this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, like the white rasta sign that should have been omitted from the movie. Next time a Rugby movie is made, we can only hope that people who know Rugby do it.
