Well, where do you begin to describe this celluloid debacle? You already know the great cool NADA passes as a plot, so let's point out that this is such a PC it is offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who gave us laughs like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this scary mess. So this guy doesn't know he's gay until this actor does it. Ok of course. If anyone ever says I'm gay, I know the truth even though I currently like girls more than George Luca $ likes a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how can I know my sexuality's true character? Well, if I like classical literature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I throw myself like a blind man in a hurry (with half my shirt hanging), I'm right. Oh, sure. <br /> <br /> And here's the great cliché of clichés: No matter how you look, there is always a very attractive Hollywood actor who will love every butterfat under your skin or a top model that I'll love your zero IQ your bumpy face and your pointing ears. If all the homosexual common places were not enough to get me angry, it did. In fact, you see something people and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: Now you say "Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!" If it's a comedy, something "carte blanche" sucks loudly, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it be much better (and more fun) to make a movie to break down the old tiring clichés, instead of enlarging them again and again? <br /> <br /> So, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If you give this rating, have something to do with my sexual tendency, let me know. I am interested.
