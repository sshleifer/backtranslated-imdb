I saw this last night with an open mind. Sorry to say it's still bad. First, the movie is too noisey and you can't hear what people are saying. The centers are bad especially Richard Masur. What is the French chick doing in this movie ??? Miscasting at worst. The walk's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and not necessary. Kristoferson's character is unlikeable, and I wanted him to be killed and walk away. Meanwhile, the Walken character is killed prematurely and easily (despite the makeup). The buttocks are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED YOU Bunch of Hicks, people are going to kill you !!!!! John Hurts character gives some humor, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this exaggerated piece of crap. The only good thing is that destroyed the director's career and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still crap all these years.
