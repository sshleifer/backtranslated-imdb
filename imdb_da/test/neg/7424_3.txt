An aircraft carrying employees from a large biotech company - including the managing director's daughter - descends into thick woodland in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is rejected, CEO Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) puts together a small hunting group to carry out their own rescue mission. But what is Knowles looking for and trying to save, and what is there that follows and sees them in the woods? <br /> <br /> What a mess this movie was! It was a shame because for one it is the stars Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite modern re-reactors, and two, it could easily have been a decent movie. It suffers from two major flaws, and they are probably both writer / director Jonas Quastel's fault - this film (which I call his aka of Sasquatch) has almost the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in the dark ( 2005) and Quastel's constant advice for the cast seems to have been: "Okay, let's try it again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise non-sequitures and generally try to be as annoying as possible ". <br /> <br /> The potential was there. In spite of the rip-off aspects (some material related to the crash, of course attempted to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999), and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exhibition and ridiculous dialogue , the plot had promise and potential for subtler and much less saccharin subtitles. Monster costume when we actually get to see it was more than enough for my taste. The mix of types of trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and co-author Chris Lanning would have knocked down stereotypical ticks from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's "lair" had something nice production design, especially the body's decorations, ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have been effective. <br /> <br /> But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of mistakes made: Quastel thinks for some reason it's a good idea to cut up on dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so we instead see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, etc. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he thinks it is a good idea to frequently use black screens between excerpts of dialogue if we need the idea of ​​an unspecified time that goes between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to happen in time in time regardless. <br /> <br /> For some reason he doesn't like scenes being shot in the morning, the afternoon, the middle of the night, etc. He just cuts them randomly. For that matter, the scenes we show seem to be chosen randomly. Important events never show up or almost, and we are stuck with too many pointless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason he left a cave art scene in the movie when it either needs more exhibit to justify getting there, or it just needs to be cut out because it's not that important (Sample intelligence and "humanity" could easily have appeared in another way). For some reason there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - back in the script, even though she is redundant. <br /> <br /> For some reason we suddenly go to an extremely soft core scene, even if the subject is never repeated again. <for some reason, the characters continue to call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H" as if they are stereotypes of Asian homes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using the "blurred Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" for the monster attack scenes, although costume doesn't look so bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or something other than bad filmography. <br /> <br /> I could go on but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie better than I did ?? I am a Henriksen fan, I am fascinated by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and it is basically a hike on one level - but I just couldn't. Every time I thought it was "getting better from this point to the end," Quastel made another terrible move. Finally my score was a 3 out of 10.
