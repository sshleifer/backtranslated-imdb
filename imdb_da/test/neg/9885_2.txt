The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me melt. Rafe and all her beauty made the film worth sitting through, even though I scratched it up and screamed. I've never seen a warmer man. <br /> <br /> -home- But it's not the intention. <br /> <br /> The title? It's actually what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. In all, I want to point out my anal-retentive glory, what was missing, what has changed, and everything else wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> Sit and go here: <br /> <br /> Illuminated is the RAFE son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently ULF is no longer ASTRID's child, as in the book. AND, as I recall from the book, were RAFE and ASTRID LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLOND, as opposed to the RED HAIR described in the book. I believe in the book that she looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the film also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> WHAT DOES AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19. In the book she was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet in HIGH SCHOOL as they both participate in the book. VIVIAN goes to see the AID because of its poem 'Wolf Change'. But according to the film, AIDEN beat his father, escaped, and now lives in Romania and draws graphic short stories. This made me go 'What F ** K.' <br /> <br /> There's no Kelly in the movie. WHERE WAS THE CELL IN THE MOVIE. The KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she also dates the AID after they broke up. Vivian even gets tips in the book and waste his room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL has a striking resemblance to a columbian drug gentleman in the movie. And he also sounds like one. His performance was very good, but his appearance threw me away. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN had no parents in the movie. Her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie. But in the book, when she comes home one night, her mother, ESME, sits on the couch after struggling with ASTRID over GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no siblings. Only her father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AID accept VIVAN for what she is. This really got me. He kills RAFE in the creepy church, confronts VIVIAN, and saves him from the other wolves unless the AID shoots her so they go to find medicine and then they try to leave town. WTF?! In the book, AID turns out when she turns into a wolf and cries like a chicken, throws things at her, and then she panics and jumps out the window. Then he prepared a story that he tried to break up with her, and she threw a chair out the window. It doesn't seem to accept me. <br /> <br /> -AID wants her to change with him. In the book, he wants nothing to do with VIVAN after she turns to him. He also doesn't love his face lovingly and says she can control it. He cries like a woman because he is cut off by her. <br /> <br /> And the final indignation ... the one who almost gave my three best friends and I heart recordings in our home: <br /> <br /> -The movie runs AID and VIVIAN together and VIVAN has killed GABRIEL. As in she shoots him. GABRIEL dies. In * BOOK * not only VIVIAN kills GABRIEL, I think they join together. As in she does not end with the AID, she ends up with GABRIEL. WHERE HELL. <br /> <br /> Little things were also noticed: Ulf's red hair, which he gets from Astrid, has been changed to brown in the movie, and Vivian is working on a chocolate store. <br /> <br /> A terrible shock; I am ashamed. The book was really not hard to follow. If Disney can use a random H! School, why couldn't the director have found a random H! School? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad it didn't follow it a bit. I give it a 2, only because (as the top of this review states) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was dead sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. AND, they kept the poem from Steppenwolf <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
