This is one of the movies that killed "spaghetti" western. It not only loses something in the translation, it is also a totally chaotic mess in editing. Any part of it has been edited out and or edited to an English language version. In any case, it gives little or no meaning, period. It makes the "Trinity" and the Eastwood "Man With No Name" movies similar to John Ford / John Wayne in comparison. Nothing in this movie is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a means and a final end. Apart from the end, everything is not exactly that order. Robert Wood seems enough. The rest of the throw, especially the women, should have made better career opportunities.
