This movie has roaches as super-meat murderers. This may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers, but not the first movie where roaches are killer. "Damnation Alley" contained a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story that had them. In this they are the star. Not as good as it could have been, this one does not have all that many kill in them. However, I could be wrong at that point because I haven't seen this for some time. The cockroaches have gone murderer and this very strange researcher is in town to study them. Yes, she's quite weird as she once has a hand in a crate on the killer's cockroaches, and she's like "they bite my hand" and she says it in almost an ecstasy state. There is also a super large roach near the end of this, as in so many insect films. Not a good movie, but worth checking out one night you're not bored.
