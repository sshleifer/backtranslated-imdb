Typical story of an evil child goes after humans. I suppose Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli didn't want to emphasize this junk on their CVs. In fact, Schiavelli left this life with a pretty good CV. Sometimes I want the killers in these movies just to go after the idiots who decide we need a new one of these movies every two months (Note: This comment must not be taken seriously, I just think slashers have lost their touch). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a movie you want to do best to avoid. It's ninety minutes to two hours that I never come back.
