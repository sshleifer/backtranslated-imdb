It wasn't a really good movie, but the play was quite smelly, and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some fun moments, but most of them were not meant to be fun. The most hilarious part of the movie for me was the part where a small child in a wheelchair falls out (it's not the fun part. What kind of person do you think I am) yet the child falls out and starts screaming for his big brother, well the brother comes running, and the way the baby runs, is so fun that he all stumbles and really overwhelms. I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh a little more. so if you are looking for something to rent, but just can't seem to find something, check this out and look for the running part.
