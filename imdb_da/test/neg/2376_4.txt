This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Fun, technically good and the usual jokes for adults. Maybe it's because it's the first cartoon I saw for Laputa: Castle in Heaven, but it was pretty disappointing. The plot is constructed and forgetful, but it means that Asterix and Obelix go to the Viking territory to save a spoiled teen who then learns humility and finds love too. Oh and at first they are not going, but after receiving adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. The best bit is to take care of the little jokes. The Vikings get all the best. Like Vikea (the Viking chief's wife) gives a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. Or the Vikings do not know the significance of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the stupid Viking, is actually fun (just as much for the voice that works as a dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, aboard the Viking ship: (After a speech from Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new guy? Captain: It's my daughter, cod brain! Olaf: Your ... daughter is a man?
