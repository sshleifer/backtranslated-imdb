Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Plan 9 from outer space" would be the worst movie ever made to deny this abysmal vulgar pile of Hollywood Guano's legitimate title. In fact, this pretentious fusion of whitish whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical commentary seems to have been formed in line with "Plan 9" with poorly tailored scenes of down-to-luck actors on cheap sets, which are distinguished by what appears to be recordings of Battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher budget epics. But while "Plan 9" occasionally manages to be fun when it comes to being and reasonably entertaining in all, this sticky adventure is dissatisfaction with lack of basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensive unfunny (Groucho Marx's vile burlesque stealing Manhattan from the Indians) to low camp (Hedy Lamarr tries to mimic Joan of Arc hear her "voices") to boring (Dennis Hopper does absolutely nothing with Napoleon's role) to the unexpectedly poor performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give Irwin Allen the worst directing trophy to do so much for so little.
