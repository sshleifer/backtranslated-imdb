I liked the entertaining character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually' and she is very good at 'Man of the Year'. <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give much of a performance, with a few minor exceptions, this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been mistaken, but she either edits her character or was just a sad performance by Director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who grew old. So many weak performances, such uneven results should be the management's fault. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are of great importance in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a creepy side with relish, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But history is clich√©, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. Pacing, history and direction are all weak compared to, says 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of My Success').
