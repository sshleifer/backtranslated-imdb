Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they will see stories of dysfunctional families, and they have come to expect them, and keeping them fresh becomes more challenging, but here despite the good caste it seems just more of the same. The story is about the Travis family who are trying to recover from the suicide of Matt (Kip Pardue), who was a very promising high school boom. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his second son Tim (Emile Hirsch) as well as Matt, but he communicates (of a kind) to his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) who finds her Stash the pot and start smoking it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also begins to flirt with much younger men as check-out cashier in the grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana she is busted and pulled out in prison. She does not tell anyone what happened, but she discovers bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has taken absence from work. After all this, Sandy gets sick and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize he must lose another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris, who has worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" and also the upcoming Superman movie, and while his script allows these characters to have real moments to express their pain and confusion, the story (for me) has just too many things The script touches so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of all of them including drugs, sex, love, adultery, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality and a life-threatening illness. If all these scenarios were not enough for you Harris, you tackle a plot twist at the end that would summarize and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. While I rolled my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script continued to roll one thing after another, I admit I didn't hate this movie and I have to credit the actors for it. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the movie, but I want the story to have concentrated more on Weaver and her character than Hirsch. Weaver is unusual and with a sharper script she might have had a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination, but instead we get endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / instructor, but with this effort he throws as many different things to the audience as the material is just being worked and constructed.
