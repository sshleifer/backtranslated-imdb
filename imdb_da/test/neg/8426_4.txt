That's all I can really say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like the Tree of Might and World's Strongest, it really ... doesn't fit into the timeline of the show, although it is supposedly placed just before the start of the TV series. The plot is pretty nice in general. The reason has a good enough base, with a good background to determine why these guys hate each other and everyone. Well generally in general, that ... The problem is ... there are many really weird things. I mean really weird things. Like the world's strongest, there is a really strange song in this one that could only have been created in a drug-induced haze ... disturbing is the fact that while Gohan, while singing, Gohan practically drifted himself. Spooky. The bad guys are strange and rather comical ... moreso than the usual DBZ type - it seems that it was made as a Dragon Ball movie instead of a Dragon Ball Z movie. Generally, it's entertaining enough, but ... just ... strange.
