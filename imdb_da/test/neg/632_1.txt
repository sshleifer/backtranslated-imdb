I did my best to see this two-hour failure. It combined the horrible special effects and plot of the original "Blob" with an execrable boosting of (outstanding in the original) manuscript of "Runaway Train." The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a big tax deduction and figured they would combine it with a shot on hosting a casting sofa. What an incredible stink! Lou Diamond Phillips is eager to show us why he will take any role no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a Texas senator, and plays well. He would be the next lead in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are incredibly bad. H. S. children in the film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The authors must have drawn a hoist on the clich√© bank to accumulate this many. I couldn't see more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except of course, 119 minutes late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.
