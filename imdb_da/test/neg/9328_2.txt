Well, after seeing "Beginner," I thought why the burned Schraders hell and hell made the hell. But now, having seen "Dominion", I deeply understand this decision. Even they didn't get much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really bad. Some good moments, but a really boring storytelling and some great plot holes kill this movie. <br /> <br /> I like things that the Exorcist story has a lot, and in a prequel on this you can build on a lot and give references the audience would like to see. But there is so much of it in the movie. The effects are really bad - not even the TV standard.
