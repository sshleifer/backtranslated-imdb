I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is horribly-posisbly thr worst of the whole show. Now I'm not keen on many episodes in the later series, but this one takes biscuits! It was unfunny and unofficial. Regarding the conclusion, I apologize, but it despised me more than any other episodes combined. <br /> <br /> I think the boys think they were good, but the end was so disturbing - they think the whale belongs to the moon and over the credits we see it's dead. Wht could have saved the episode if pranksters could confess what they did. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park might be guilty of preaching too much, and it's always nice to see an unpreachign (like Make Love Not Warcraft), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid at all costs! Helen xxxxx
