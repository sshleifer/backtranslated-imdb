Bone Collector is set in New York City and starts as one of the world's leading criminologists & crime scene experts. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him a cheated quadriplegic. Jump forward four years and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped soon after New York policeman Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene and finds the buried and mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notes some unusual crime scene evidence and notes what impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case, recognizing quickly the evidence is actually cryptic traces to Lindsay's whereabouts. After blowing up the clues, the police are too late to save her, but that is just the beginning when a sadistic serial killer continues to kill and leaves criminal justice to the Rhyme & police ... Directed by Phillip Noyce I saw The Bone Collector last night and I have to say that it is one of the worst big budget items The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer's thrillers I've seen, it actually does Friday the 13th) look sophisticated and realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so bad on so many levels, I hardly know where to start. For a start, it takes itself fatally serious, and it makes all the other mistakes that are twice as bad. The sign is really terrible and I didn't think any of them were real people. Firstly, we have Lincoln Rhyme, who is paralyzed from the neck down and there just isn't much the script can do with him, in fact he can literally do nothing but lie in bed for the whole movie. He's apparently impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train and thought that a new footprint near a murdered person might be relevant, I'm not fun here, but wouldn't a policeman experience a footprint near a killing could have any relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who is not only unlikely and shouts at all for no apparent reason, but is so incompetent that he could not connect several murders committed in a short time, with each victim having surgically removed parts of meat and skin from their bodies , how did this guy just be a police officer? Then there is the killer whose motive is less than plausible, are you trying to tell me that they devised an intricate plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in prison for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill all the other people who had no connection with anything, I might just buy someone who wanted revenge on the guy who put them away, but not kill any other people, who has no connection to himself, the intended goal Rhyme something else. Also, after devising a complicated plan to kill these people and get away with it, they suddenly become the most stupid person in history who, despite having a big knife and being able to go and use their weapons, they become actually knocked down and almost killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body under his neck! How did it happen? I must also mention Amelia, who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take the scene of the crime and shoot rats without apparent reason. Besides some of the worst characters ever is the story and the plot is not much better We never find out why the killer uses the Bone Collector book as inspiration. We never find out why the killer took strips of meat from his victims. It is never explained why a rookie policeman like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the right forensic teams. There is no reason why the killer chooses his victims. Also, the killer's track is a little unclear, aren't they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically, how does a person from a bone and rat hair go to the exact location of the next victim and have the whole of New York to choose from? There is some nonsense about a bird sitting on the Rhymes window edge, which is completely random and after almost two hours Bone Collector is very slow. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's terribly at all levels and has no credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot naked scenes for this movie, but they were cut because they felt too distracting. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of approx. $ 48,000,000 is Bone Collector well made with good production values ​​& that Hollywood is delighted with it. I must also add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst ideas I have ever seen, I think she is absolutely horrible in this. Denzel Washington just kind of lies that really, Queen Latifah is horrible, and even Michael Rooker can't do much as he stuck with a cliché and one-dimensional character. Bone Collector must be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen for a while, I saw it for free on telly last night and I still feel cheated and cut off. There are just as many things to poke holes in, it's stupid, embarrassingly horrible, or should it be terribly embarrassing? Works in a way to be honest ...
