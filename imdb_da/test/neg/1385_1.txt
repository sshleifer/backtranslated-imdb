That's right, I can't see Comedy Central anymore just because I can't carry to see the repeated advertisements for this show. I will tell you the truth, this is a terrible show, not because I'm offended by it, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather look at carrots, make a George Bush impression than look at this unfinished hack. And to believe he calls himself the greatest. Although he did not steal the jokes, he is still bad at telling them he is way off-timing and unoriginal. I remember in a joke, he said: "Why do white people go camping? To let it be poor for a week?" So what does that mean? That all white people are rich? Another I did not understand was when he made a shit of the price is right, and he told some cool guy: "You need to know how much a fridge costs you are fat" and the fat guy had the bleak look at his face . But what does that mean? That "cool people" are always looking for refrigerators? It's just the two I've seen in his commercials, God knows what his show is like. <br /> <br /> This show falls into that kind of Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
