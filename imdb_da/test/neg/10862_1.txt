This movie Oh my God, this movie is so bad, I'm amazed. I managed to see it all. <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to say that Vinny Jones should only play a London Thug period, so it is the end of the story .. Pisttolero is so compelling its almost comedy. Deviant in Dennis Hopper and David Carradine did not store this movie .. in fact, I think it is a whole comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh my god , I thought I saw everything when he played the Irish tinker: P <br /> I think the average viewer will realize that this movie might be a never-to-be movie type. I can't see how anyone could actually fall into this crap
