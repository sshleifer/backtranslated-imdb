I just finished seeing disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in a largely vacant 1000-seat auditorium. The party programmer, having seen the lack of audience, started his opening remarks with, "Well it is good that some of those who participate in the festival have good taste in film". Now Mr. Programming, after watching this movie, I must reply back "No, we don't, and you do too!" This "back-woods" period piece follows young (not so) Wild Bill when he and his mysterious family dangerously drive illegal Canadian whiskey across the border under US prohibition. The parents (Kris Kristofferson and the company) not only need the money to save their Vermont Farm, but want to introduce Little Wild Bill to the doom. <br /> <br /> Although well photographed, this adventure story is lacking in what makes movies of this kind, "excitement" and credibility. Kristofferson's loud performance and dry monologues remind me of a dream I once had, where Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just didn't care, and when Wild Bill's mysterious grandmother seems out of thin air to give him advice, it just doesn't fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a great job as Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller's character; mother-in-law from Big Bill, while teenager Chris McDermott uses these piercing blue eyes for his acting. <br /> <br /> But generally expect to see Jay Craven's disappearances playing at a Block Buster $ 2 Bin near you.
