This movie beats everything out there. Well, what you are looking for depends on ... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in its full league. I don't think any movie could get close to it. I'm not sure what the director intended to do as a thriller or a comedy. If he thought he was making a thriller, then he has a lucky happiness, created one of the best Bollywood comedies from time to time. You have to see it to believe it. A matrix + terminator + a number of other films rolled into one along with a story dating back to the 1980's Hindu movie, with an icchadhari na (a mythical snake that can turn into a human being). <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie if you sit with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side and plan to laugh at the movie! I'm not sure if I should give it a 1 or a 10 .. On the basis of turning a coin I have decided to give it a 1!
