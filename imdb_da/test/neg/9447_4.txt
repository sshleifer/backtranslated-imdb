The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop eating at a little greasy happening, reluctantly learning about the infamous area 51 of the cafe owner (Jonathan Breck). After returning on the road in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio gets a bit of a crazy broadcast of Hitler's speech in the 1836 Olympics, and later a Elvis Presley news bulletin was drafted in the 1958 military. in too frightening of their lives, as mysterious inexplicable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert; residues of nuclear testing. Megan meets a lost little girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded WWII soldier. The nightmare journey doesn't end there. Kresler is impressive to a degree, and author / director James Lay makes good use of the Patsy Cline tunes. All in all, moderately interesting Sci-Fi.
