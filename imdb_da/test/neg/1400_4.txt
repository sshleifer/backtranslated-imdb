Stylized Hollywood Westerns, full of well-known conventions, seem to have eternal life, and this is an avatar. Everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the drawer from 1939, a larger budget is used, and this produces its problem. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this kind of role dozens of times - the displaced southern, quick on the draw and stuck with credit, though it's easy to go when possible. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas looking for the gang, which destroyed his cotton plantation. He has a buckskin frayed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters. He speaks with an enchanted accent - "A trap can get hurt doing it". (See "Sergeant York.") The gang is led by sneaking Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually by subordinate means whenever possible. The tapes include Steve Cochran, who cannot play a Westerner, although he is very good at getting scum bags in general. The required woman is Ruth Roman, the daughter of the Mexican plantation owner who looks and speaks as Mexican as a Boston brown betty. I do not think I will interfere too much with the plot. It is undoubtedly someone who has gone into it in detail and it is no longer worth mentioning. As in all 1939 westerns, it is labyrinthine. All but Cooper and his friends are underhanded, and there are several double crosses and changed identities and hidden secrets. Everything is retro. The reason, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is by Warner's stalwart Max Steiner. He is the guy who scored "King Kong." It was 1932. This film was released in 1950. By the way, Cooper's name - "Blayde Hollister" - made me look through RACA's records - The Real American Cowboy Associate - to see if the name is in their archives that go from the beginning of the time until February 4, 1911, when the last true cowboy died due to an unfortunate encounter with a fake peccary. There has never been a real cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of any Real Cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt either. The most popular names for true cowboys, in descending order, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebuchadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. In 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.
