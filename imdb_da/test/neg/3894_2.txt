I've seen this movie twice, some years ago in college, and again last weekend. Although I completely despised it for the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is obviously a respected director, and it seems that the IMDb viewers are at least thinking very much about the movie. But unfortunately, it seems that my taste has not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? For one thing, Linda Manz's story is horrific. Her voice is so annoying with the horrible New York accent (please don't try to convince me that Chicagoans speak like that - they don't). She admitted herself to sit and talk about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She doesn't even act! I came on IMDb and expect to see her cracked apart, as her performance is just so utterly ridiculous, but people actually liked it! She is simply unappealing in every way - I hope Malick would just kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. Except for the old guy - he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Talking about acting, how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid ?? He bought "brother and sister" action because ... why would he buy it? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be touch sensitive, as if they didn't realize their life was dependent on acting in a very platonic way. It was just incredible. And finally, after a long time, the farmer suddenly discovers that "Oh my God, they are together!" Then he goes after Bill with a gun, but instead appears to enter Bill's hand and end up with a mortal year. <br /> <br /> Talk about the fate of the characters as stupid (and dare I say lazy). Of course, Bill must die - could it be more boring than being shot in a pond by a pack of police? Abby continues his happy life, goes on a train and feels really happy with the way things worked. And the Irish narrator randomly finds his deadly friend, and they walk out into the sunset. But that's okay, because Malick never gave me any reason to worry about the signs anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this movie infinitely draws without actual plot twists or developments. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes long - I could have sworn that I was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. The sudden John's drama was like throwing the Bible in my face; I'm fine with metaphors and allusions, but it was all over the top. It was clear that the message was, "Don't marry money or if bad things happen." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Heaven's Days", like all Terrence Malick's films, must be a work of art. And I would certainly agree that the cinematography is simply amazing, and the magical time shots add a unique aura to the movie. But I need more than good pictures to enjoy a movie, and one just didn't do it for me.
