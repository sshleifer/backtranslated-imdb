The story was uneven, the play was not of anything you could categorize. More of a serial pilot than a real movie. I would like this movie, but just couldn't find anything to like about it. Whatever it was that made the lost boys so cozy was obviously absent here. Altho it was trying hard. Plot hooks were clumsy placed in the middle of what could have been an episode of dawson's creek with dark clothes, and the story bow should not come soon. Very disappointing to me. The end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of history planned his entire scheme .. who was he (or she) trying to kid, talk about naive. Stick with movies of this kind of genre from the eighties as they had more of an idea.
