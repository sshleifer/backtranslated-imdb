I bought a tape of this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and have to say I was very disappointed. I am a university professor and showed this movie to my class; they voted unanimously that it is a horrible movie. I guess if you like the old Dark Shadows series then you might like it here. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a child in the 70's, but now I think it's just awful). The first half hour or so has at least a depth of some allegiance to Wilde's novel. After that, the story is wild, of course, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is really about the only thing that can be seen throughout the production. A lot of the other plays are bad, the music is melodramatic, and watching the movie is horrible. In fact, it's not at all a movie - it was of course shot on video and has the distinctive claustrophobic BBC look at it. The opening scenes are particularly badly lit, the women's costumes are awful (the men look ok), and many characters - including Dorian - seem to have 1970s instead of Victorian hairstyles. The film makes it really good to include a lot of Wilde's dialogue, but the voice-over story in Dorian's voice contains a lot of nonsense that directly contradicts Wilde's character. I'm a great Oscar Wilde fan, and I'm afraid he must have rolled violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made. The only improvement over the 1945 version is that homosexual subtitles are quite clear without being heavy-handed. I haven't seen any of the newer versions, but if you are interested in seeing the story well told, I should recommend 1945 MGM black and white over this one.
