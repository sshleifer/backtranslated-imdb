This movie is surely up there with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of worst movies. I laughed once and it was then: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a hair salon" <br /> <br /> It was literally the only one Once I laughed at this 'comedy', horrible compared to Bruce's omnipotent, like a great Jim Carrey fan ... not even that big! <br /> <br /> This movie lacked humor to have God's power and was more about family bonding. Id class it exclusively as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Watching a bird cushion on a person's shirt is not fun, even a beard that grows back instantly! <br /> <br /> I didn't even think the special effects were good, the animals were really stuck on, it was like watching a movie that was not "glued" together properly <br /> <br /> 2 / 10 Movies - Avoid!
