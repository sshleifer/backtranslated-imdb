Hi what a good idea to open a movie - show someone's home video. Drama schools must be full of idiots! Taking the drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home video to a studio. Hi, I think I send in the video of my wedding and call it THE LARGEST ROMANCE ever seen or sent in a band of my honeymoon and call it the best sex ever seen. Oh, I'm not married and I've never been to honeymoon! Don't worry I'm sending a video of a share's honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You are thinking of an opening like the one that SHARK HUNTER couldn't improve on you? As shocking as it may seem, the home movie is the best directed, best written and best performed part of the film, unfortunately it is all downhill from here, as the family goes to sea (in fact, a toe-hole swimming pool) in a three-footed boat where mother and dad is eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the finer. Cut to the present and the French use an underwater research base for oil exploration. Only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can't see it here - it's not filmed underwater !!! , the director has made no attempt to even use the inconsistent technique of shooting the scene through an aquarium. The investigation ground is blown up by the shark (perhaps it is employed by Greenpeace?) Kills everyone inside and Spencer is now an adult man hired to hunt the shark who killed his parents and a bunch of Frenchmen. What happens more? No idea, because I decided to see something else <br /> <br /> No hard feelings if any of the casting and crew read this and I hope Matt Codd will be a big fish in Hollywood. You think you know about sharks Matt? You haven't seen anything yet
