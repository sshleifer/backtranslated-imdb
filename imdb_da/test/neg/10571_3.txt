This movie is fun if you are the gentleman who was sitting in three rows behind me (repeating each stroke line, grinning as there were no gags on the screen and issued a gravel "haaaa" on all scenes involving a computer or mobile device ). <br /> <br /> For everyone else, it is a medieval, bungled "comedy". The film follows the strict formula for the later "Scary Movie" films, as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", but without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two annoying. Nevertheless, the lamp of intellectual and peacekeeping characters around the world shows that it is clear that the film knows the audience: People who envy their brain power. "Superhero Movie" is especially and consistently ugly that Stephen Hawking introduces him as a sex-hungry druggy and uses his disability as a slapstick tool. The reason is based on "Spider-Man" with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" thrown in just to deliver some physical comedies. Much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any refreshing or interesting way. The longest-running gag is a speeding joke, and early on it seems to be believed that the protagonist thrown into conspicuous piles of false animal cushions automatically experiences an otherwise uninspired rehash of the Spider-Man spider bit scene. Perhaps the only solution function of this function is the energy of it, especially absent in other recent parodies. The filmmakers act as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors jump around on the screen. An extremely shortened length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the presentation of the presentation make "Superhero Movie" tolerable rather than horrible.
