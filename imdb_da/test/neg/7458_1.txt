Everything about this movie is bad. everything. Ridiculous 80's haircut. Ridiculous mustache. Ridiculous actions and battle scenes, where you can actually see that the opponents do not even hit each other. Bad, bad, bad 80 music. Repeated scenes of people running through the forest. A bad guy with a silver plastic hand and stupid hair. Stupid dialogue. The action is non-existent. Everything looks extremely cheap. This film even surpasses "Plan 9 from outer space" in its extreme badness. It's not "funny bad" it's just bad.
