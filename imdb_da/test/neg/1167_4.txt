Ever since he played a goon in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got the whole public last year, but he still produces a few more movies each year. He should have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of slashers. He has played Jason Voorhees from 1988's Friday 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new movie that appears to be a Halloween remake. He is very much what I would call the serial killer with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> But there wasn't much blood in this movie, and very little action took place on the camera. It felt like I saw an episode of true law enforcement at A&E. I don't want to blame Hodder's shoulders for the rest, as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either. Michael Berryman (The holes have eyes, the devil's rejection) just jumped his mouth until Gein closed him. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was sweet. Veterans actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but they just seemed to run through their roles.
