It was as if someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was amazing. Everything else was horrible, the plugs for the directors second movie that seemed to happen every other minute, the video of the actual ghost hunt was edited as a scary movie rather than a study, they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what happened. Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, it would fly by! Most of it was just people talking about the place. The section of the Ghosthunters show that went there definitely destroys how this show was. I'm so sorry the sci-fi channel to play this, I haven't seen it since it was sent.
