Hype! Everyone adds! I was bummed that I missed this on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the small details. In all other things, it failed. Arnold has made so many better performances in the last couple of years. I thought Commando and Last Action Hero's days were away from our lives. Unfortunately, this movie is the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a rolling, grinning, heavy-handed muscle that only shoots weapons and blows things up. In a clich√© last minute (and at another time) that was predictable from the start, we see a foam of the actor who has proven that he is more than what he was paid too early in his career. I was unimpressed with the movie as it never broke new ground or walked anywhere but where you expected it.
