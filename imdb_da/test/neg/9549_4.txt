The story has too many mistakes and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's performance is quite flat and poor, Washington is ok, the rest of the casting is cardboard cutouts. Somehow, almost everything about this movie oozes mediocrity. The reason is lamb. The only thing I was more or less like about this movie is the rather original methods that the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most extensive CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway through the movie, you wonder if the instructor himself took care of detailed credibility. (Some Spoilers Hereafter!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sine wave that reflects a man's heartbeat, a quadriplegic with full muscle cramps and a work index finger. A killer strikes a man's inn and keeps him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming at the guy's FACE! What's with all that stupidity? Then there are a lot of continuity holes, but you can find them elsewhere here on IMDb. Frankly, I found it a bit of insult, even though my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Waste of time. Still 4 out of 10 to keep my boyfriend from kicking me.
