Franco Nero is like Cole, a ninja who comes to the rescue of his warrior Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his retrieving wife (Susan George) to protect them from a mobster (Christopher George) who wants the country. Things become even more complicated when mobster hires Cole's old nemesis (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. Unfortunate martial arts activity, while having better production values, saw most ninja films fail to inject any life into the environment or for that matter. A bad effort around.
