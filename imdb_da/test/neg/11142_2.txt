I like underground movies when they have something to say or show for that matter. I tried hard to like "Trash". I tried to see some artistic performances or an interesting representation of New York City's life in the early 70s. Or at least entertained by it? But the movie stinks and cannot be called art or entertainment. "Trash" is basically an excuse to reveal Joe Dallesandro's naked body for 2 hours while meeting other uninteresting, annoying characters (I agree, it's a beautiful body, but no excuse for a whole movie about it, right?) . Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's boyfriend, gives a couple of good laughs at last, but then it's too late to save those wasted hours. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrayal of these people and then, even though it is more fascinating than they actually were. 1.5 / 10.
