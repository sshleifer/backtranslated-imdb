Big book, badly made movie. Cheesy performances and constructed situations make this movie a sentimental drill. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the post-school special category. There is no doubt that there are many talents to be poured into this caste and crew, but something went awful. The very talented Gretchen Mol is trying to pull this movie out of the bog, but even she can't seem to rise above the stupid dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it. Even the makeup (Mulrooney for 20 years during the film) looks amateurish and raw. Don't waste your time on this clunker .... go read the book.
