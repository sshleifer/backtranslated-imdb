Once there was a big American movie. Which combined horror and straight-line comedy. This movie highlighted wise direction. Pioneering special effects and excellent comedic and serious action. It had the title 'An American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later, the long-awaited successor was finally attached to the poster board outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the excitement in the original. Think again. 'An American werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible root from start to pitiful finish. The problems begin with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiring. From the beginning he seems to have the intention of proving that all young people are simpletons. In his defense, even an experienced Shakespeare thespian could not have obtained a good performance from the young and ignorant dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends whose soul is sentenced to land after being slaughtered by one of the wolves is finally able to leave life. He then tips to Scott and his friends. "Okay guys, see you." What a memorable farewell. Julie Delphy soon shows Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, she is a French girl who plays the French girl. It's not much of a stretch. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing about the movie. The special effects, such an integral part of the amazing original film, fall very short in this flop. The werewolves are similar to comics. And no matter how well you sculpt a comic book with delicate lycanthropic muscles. It's still hard to be afraid of a cartoon. So instead, it holds vacationing American gang, led by ultra weak Scott, excuses to return to the wolf's catacomb lair. Here it is much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer improved creatures or absurd animal masks under the cover of the dark. Some have said that if you don't watch this movie as a sequel, it's not that bad in comparison. I disagree, this movie cannot stand alone and is even more a disgrace compared to the brilliant original. If it will not be considered a successor, it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 movie. I don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped "American werewolf in London." as I did. This is simply not worth wasting your time. "Okay guys, see you." Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.
