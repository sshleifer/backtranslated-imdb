Esther Williams plays a romantic independent water skiing secretary who longs to stop "walking on the water" and being a man's wife; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are her potential choice for a man. Despite fine aquatic sequences recorded at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is very outdated. As the hell of plodding director Charles Walters, everything here is made to be intentionally harmless, which doesn't give the picture much resilience. Even Ester's great moments in the water are not quite up to the exciting leaps from his other swimming vehicles, even though they prefer to sit with the men, both are colorless. Carroll Baker is in his film debut as Martin's unhappy ex-girlfriend, the liveliest of the pile. Thrifty stuff, yes. * 1/2 from ****
