It's amazing to think that this movie came out just a year before Star Wars, but seems to be a million years behind it in sophisticated and special effects. In fact, the art direction and the set design (nice Victorian spaceship) are not bad; These are the monster costumes that are most ridiculous that resemble the "guy in a rubber boot" monster from the LOST IN SPACE TV show. The evil cave-man makeup reminded me of some foreigners from old TWILIGHT ZONE reruns. <br /> <br /> The script is stylized, and outside Peter Cushing's comic relief, the play is also rather miserable. This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy poor kitschy SF. And the music ... yikes! A terrific 70s experiment with synthesizers that do not match the movie's time period and sounds like a person falling with a Minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
