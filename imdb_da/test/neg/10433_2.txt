When I think of a movie from the 1970s, that's not what I'm thinking of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack drawn with the top 40 bubbly songs from the day epitomized the 70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was particularly annoying. The actor (if you can call it) was a lot of wood and seemed just read from the monotone script. The film quality and camera work was terrible; the scary dialogue, the script seemed to be thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if it was not present. I can't believe people give it the high ratings I've read here. Basically a forgettable, poor attempt to recreate a beloved era from the past. Two stars is all I can come up with. Sorry, boys.
