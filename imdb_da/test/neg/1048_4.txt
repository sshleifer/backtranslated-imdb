Honestly I'm not impressed with it, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a big movie either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, which forms make it lost, it is full meaning and ability to intrigue. This movie could have been made in another way with an excellent result, the story is just as interesting, but somehow I'm not thrilled when I see it. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional. The actors and actors do a good job, and so does the instructor, but there is just so much of the film that I can't put my finger on. Perhaps, if you had become aware of the characters more, the whole movie's "messiness" could be better clarified and put more "action" through it all because it was, nonetheless slowly from time to time.
