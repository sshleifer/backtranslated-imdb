And of course I didn't see it! <br /> <br /> But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I now know to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think the audience is stupid that they are not going to catch continuity errors. A presumably dead Doug Masters returns is a huge giant, you won't say? <br /> <br /> And I can't believe anyone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return to something like that. <Br /> <br /> Has Jason Gedrick really rejected this? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would still have had the same continuity error. I bet (if he really knocked it down) he must have been incredible when his character died in the other movie. I'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way should I rent this or buy the DVD!
