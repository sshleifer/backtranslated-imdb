First of all, this movie is not nearby, my guess is that someone has actually bothered to steal every other side of the script. <br /> <br /> The movie contains bizarre time travel without notice, inconsistent dialogues, misplaced details all over, the music is not at all bad, other so misplaced tracks, and in addition volume goes up and down the different tracks. In fact, the cutter made a descent job, and that says a lot. Misplaced sound effects destroy the voltage. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, just looks worried, and occasionally punch lines from hell. <br /> <br /> I'm seriously looking at this movie as worst 2007, and I've seen some bad ones. Don't spend money on this, it's not that bad, it's a laugh, it's worse. Ratings over 1 star must make a blacklist on IMDb because it's a fucking lie.
