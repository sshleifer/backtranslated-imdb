Big disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is very much for talky and stagy, and the dialogue doesn't respond like sand from these characters. This is the melodrama at its peak. The action is really over the top and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this movie any zip. Wish they had more to do. I am someone who looks at details in movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who sees the baby all day, when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas works, then breaks a fight in a bar with your father? 2. When Stanwyck packs to leave town, why is she seen at her brother's place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the projection room at Theater, who takes care of the baby again? Such details really annoy me and make me give movies much lower ratings. What were the authors, directors and anyone else associated with film thinking? Nuf said.
