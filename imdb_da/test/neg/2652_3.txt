Two things - too long and completely inadequate credibility. This movie made no sense and it was apologetic to sit through. I'm usually pretty patient, but man ... It doesn't keep your attention at all! I think I'm beautiful here myself! You keep believing it's almost just to find out that it's still another half an hour! Good actors.
