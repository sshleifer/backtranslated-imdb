Terry Cunningham heads this Sci-Fi Network original. Everything is not good in Washington State and Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to lose most of the Pacific Ocean in the ocean. Attempts to keep the world from falling into ecological chaos, a crack team of scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) takes a massive earth-drilling vessel called "Mole" to chew the way to Earth's burning nucleus to avert impending death. Technical dialogue does not help or speed up this movie together. The action is lame, but Perry has always been laid back. You can only blame him for joining. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
