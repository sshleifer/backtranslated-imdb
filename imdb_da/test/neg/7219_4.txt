Let me start by saying that you know that a movie is badly run when extras make the cover. Having said that, anyone who says this is the worst movie ever to be dramatic, and anyone who says the movie is big is completely misleading. The movie "is what it is." And what is it ... A modest budget ($ 4 million, I estimate) studio sequences. The movie is not horrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem 1, like Dirty Dancing wouldn't be what it was without Swayze, Road House is not the same without him. The management lacks depth, character and equality to carry the film. I feel the management was badly cast and the producers should have bent backwards to get Patrick to do so if they were to make a successor. The second cast was uneven with excellent players like Will Patton along side day players who couldn't trade that far out of a paper bag. Busey, as I've seen, makes big signs, he thought he just sent it in. Ellen was played well, except that he was not credible as a buggy that raised chicken. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was warm and a good actress, but her part was scary and undeveloped. The author missed all the opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and the characters. Instead, you choose a basic dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script ... I got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three scriptwriters separated by a "and" and a "&." It looked so much amateur. And that was what the writing was. I heard the original script was better, and then a rewrite was written and the hard core sucked began. Some cheezy parts of the movie to watch are ... During the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. "Hey lets meet on a crowded naked bar, I want to pull a cookie block out of my jacket and you withdraw money so we slip them under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is watching!" Secondly, I love it when someone is shot in the chest, and then you see him sit happy as a lark 10 minutes later. There are some unpleasant editing cuts at the end of the movie, especially during battle scenes, and when the main character chases through the doors and enters a protector. Which brings me to the reality of the DEA training, I will not both get technical ... But jumping through the doors is not standard training ... And neither are typical female agents breaking their bends to make it a male oriented field, acting as weak characters ... drilling! Thanks for the chauvinist view Heir Director. There are other things I could learn a course on a school about it ... Sped up fighting, cheezy dialogue, recycled history ... etc. But apart from all that you just don't like ex-Mr. Applegate, he completely lacks the humble zen cold that did Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He hits me as one of the 5 foot no actors who think they are a bad ass, but like Van Damnit he runs into a really bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Do not case) and he gives him a lesson on "bathing stuff." Therefore, what I feel is the big linchpin of the movie, if you're a bad ass, you're a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a pretty boy trying to prove hard, you're a bad ass among others ... So good ... You're why your audience, average Joe ... Won't rent this movie and if they Do what they will write reviews like this.
