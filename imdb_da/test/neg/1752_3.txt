Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes Igmar Bergaman's film, Shame. At only 18, I still have what I think you could call a smaller form of ADD and well, I see movies that need to be entertained. Shame was a film with a very interesting precondition for trying to convey the war effect to the ordinary people, but it was not possible to achieve this for me. I don't know if it was the subtitles, black and white movies, the length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours out of my study for a huge chemistry test, but I didn't enjoy it. I understand that it is considered a good movie and very important in the history of the cinema, but I think, as my teacher pointed out, not everyone has wanted or liked it. I guess I just want it finished with all its many pages. Perhaps the translation lost something, but I felt that there were endless small shots that never came to a conclusion. You would meet characters and never see them again, or really understand why they were in the movie. My overall recommendation for this movie is that it is worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion about it. Whether you like or dislike it, it is necessary to respect the point it is trying to convey.
