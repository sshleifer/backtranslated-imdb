In fact, the only reason I downloaded this movie from Blockbuster was because Aaron Carter was in it. Okay first thing is first. Can you notice how ugly Aaron Carter has become ?? I mean, he used to be so cute, but now .. with the slim body and speckled skin - EW. I think he should stop singing and the film's directors could have found a much better guy who could lip-sync. No offense, however. I thought this teenage film was heavily paralyzed - and it comes from myself and is even a teenager. The "significant girls" who are so predictable, the play is so amateurish, it makes you scratch at times (especially from Aaron) and generally I just haven't had it. Even if I give up the story - it was okay, but not at all realistic. Anyway, stay away from this movie in every way you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. It's not worth $ 6.50! <br /> <br /> (P.S, this review of mine should not apply to younger children under 13!)
