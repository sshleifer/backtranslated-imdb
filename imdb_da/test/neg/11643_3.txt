The best thing about this flick is that it seems that they used a lot of things back from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of P-40 that crashed into the row of parked P-40s, but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately, it just gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> There are two black guys and two white guys like US POWs, as well as some Filipino POWs and Japanese Guards. The Americans' ranking POWER is a white fleet lieutenant, who is, of course, an O-3 in the fleet. In any case, he needs a haircut, bad, distractingly bad. Hockey hair does not belong to a WWII movie. Oh, and he's racist. He does not want to share quarters with 'negros'. Of course, he would not share quarters with the white enlisted guy either. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause on officer quarters and acceded, but it was not the intention here. Oh yes, I think the plot is secondary to other problems in this flick. He is put in place and uses virtually the rest of the film as a look out and drives the air pump to the divers. <br /> <br /> But when you arrive, it's not a bad story. Japsne wants the divers to lift silver released by the Americans before Corrigador fell. The Philippine resistance wants them to take their time. And the POWs do their best to help. A potentially good story and not so badly done, I think. A bit unbelievable when the POWs use the camp again made breathing to swim between the POW camp and the Philippine village every night. Maybe I'm not that fussy when I know that this is not a film. I think that's why it comes on a 20-pack DVD war movie collection for five bucks. The 70s music did not belong to this movie or any other WWII movie. It is quite distracting to say the least. The action wasn't that bad. Probably better than I could do. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not any Richard Pryor made up. It was in itself the 25th I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> Worth looking at TCM or pay a quarter for. <br /> <br /> A star to be a war movie, another to be World War II and another because I feel generous.
