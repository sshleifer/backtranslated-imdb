I saw this movie, which I really thought was a promising start, but it just made me feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this movie was that the director tried a little too hard to make this movie strange and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" that got me annoyed by the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this movie, they could do much better. This movie seemed promising at the beginning, pulling in the middle and then disappointing at the end. The movie could never beat Stanley Kubrick's geniousness when it comes to controversial cases, weirdness and originality in movies.
