Yes, the title line actually appears in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually said, nobody in the crew movie at any time laughs? I would have liked to see the exits from this movie, mostly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Helmed by director Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer,") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we have never seen a teen slasher movie before. Of course, he must not be blamed. There are also three authors responsible and it is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The title of the game is "Backwater", but after looking for information about it, I came up with absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And then we start the movie ... I want to say before I continue it I didn't expect to win an Oscar. When I am in the right mind, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original and smart slasher movie. "Venom" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no sign development at all. It is fine. You don't expect a lot. But instead of a well-cast piece of few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie cliché characters ... <br /> 1. The Final Girl: She just broke up for her boyfriend. It means that at some point in the movie, when they are in danger, they will decide to get together again. Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor in the movie. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm I can add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: He's just around to co-exist with The Final Girl until his death. Yes, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Normally, horror movies are only a need for one of these, but here we have two. They shoplift, they steal, they can show their breasts (not in this case), or they may be alcoholics. A staple of the genre. They also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonely, usually saying things like "Hello? Is there anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", appropriately named, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Well, he looks pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie, deployed solely to be an idiot. He says stupid things, has stupid things, has never seen a horror movie, and is one of the most enjoyable kills you look at this kind of thing. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The Girlfriend: She loves the Jackass, though virtually no one else does, and she is usually the one who lives alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts to stumble and be left behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get the picture. The remaining characters are not very common, as they are equally fatal. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") who was surely robbed of the screen, and "Who knows what is going on." Of course, this is not something that matters, because first and foremost everyone believes that one is crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters, namely a substitute played by Method Man, but he and others are killed quite quickly and receive even less character development than the following clichés. <br /> <br /> Then you think, "Why does this movie require such a deep analysis? It's just a summer fear to cry" loud! "Based on that question, it delivers the goods? Yes and no. The action is not very convincing, even given the amount of talent involved. Bijou Phillips was hailed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully and Agnes Bruckner has been a up-and-coming talent for a while. <br /> <br /> So what about gore? There are some. It's really about it. Many of the juiciest bits are cut-aways. face and a sandblaster are used to remove paint from cars. <br /> <br /> For the film maker there are a few interesting scenes, I liked the bit where part of a house was literally torn off, so it Unstoppable villain could come to the characters. <br /> <br /> If all of this had been centered on a smarter manuscript where the characters did not make the same stupid mistakes, literally hundreds of horror movie characters made in front of them could have done for a more enjoyable experience, all the most inter Essential characters are instantly killed in the first third of the movie, and then it just becomes a non-interesting countdown until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should be a little sad, but as a horror movie fan, I wonder why I should have bothered as I could easily have written a better manuscript myself. I won't even mention the many cases of horrible CGI.
