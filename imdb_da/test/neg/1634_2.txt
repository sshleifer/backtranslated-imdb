Another in the long line of Conan wannabes who is tired of paying for that movie's success is this Italian monstrosity as bad as they came. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight with invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply that there was no money for either appropriate special effects or hiring real people. I don't even want to interfere with going into the plot when I defy anyone to follow it and sense the story. Maybe it's the TV screen I watched, but I can't imagine a version being so much better. It all seems so random to me. Evil men, hollow men, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hangars? none of them fit each other. It is as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic fit while making Cave Dwellers (or any of the other half dozen names the movie passes by) and threw everything he could think of on the screen, no matter how independent it was. was or how it fits into the movie's already amazing plot. The action is sufficiently poor. Miles O'Keeffe could never act out of a wet paper bag and he once again proves it in this movie. The rest of the casting is just as horrible. Then there it is. . . Well, you get the idea. It's late, I'm tired, and I've already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of waste. Take my word for it ?? Avoid Cave Dwellers (or whatever you want to call it) at all costs.
