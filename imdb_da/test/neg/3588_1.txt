FC De Kampioen's only reason for existence is the local popularity. It has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years (and still count). It's about an amateur football team with the weight "amateur". Each story deals with the same topic: A certain misconception that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to be resolved in the end. <br /> <br /> The show has been running for over 15 years now and production has probably not decided to change a winning team. This means that the show has had little changes over the years (in addition to a few actors being replaced (they almost all left themselves instead of being thrown out of the show)). Humor has not changed a little over the years, and it was already outdated when it was first aired. <br /> <br /> I think you should be Flemish to have it, and over 60 years, enjoy such an old-fashioned TV show like this.
