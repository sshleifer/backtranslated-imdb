Perfect double counting for the horrible corny "Beverly Hillbillies" is this equally awful, lame minded "comedy", "son of law". Country Girl Rebecca goes to the wild California to go to college just to be assaulted by the lifestyle. "Resident Advisor" "Crawl" helps her settle down and soon they are two good friends. Bec decides to bring the crazy "Crawl" home to Thanksgiving, with obvious "fish out of water" results. The only other comic angle Steve Rash (appropriate name) achieves here is a sexual one. This he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. Both cartoons fail dismally, and you know that the movie bursts when "Crawl" hijacks the combine and writes its name on the grain field. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the film is also short, with several attempts at family and personal advice from "Crawl" misfiring. Between them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a few smiles, but slightly different, while the rest of the casting is only feed. The problem is that it is almost impossible to actually "crawl" and you will find yourself using the whole girl and wondering why Rebecca would like to spend a moment with him. But if you are a fan of relentless comedy, "Son of Law" is right on the mark. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
