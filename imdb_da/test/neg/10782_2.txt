If you dear reader never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s drenched buddy-action comedy briefly launches' n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town policemen who don't play by the rules. It is largely the scale of the film. Interest rates are somewhat burdened by Hines' line delivery, which is intriguingly similar to Will Smith's and of cameos by now more famous actors such as Memento's Joe Pantoliano and "NYPD Blue's" Jimmy Smits. My favorite scene is I, the car's hunt for the tracks, I think. Basically, I just see this movie as a great helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks. Well, this and deadly weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and The Man ...
