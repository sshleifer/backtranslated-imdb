This is a good prerequisite for a movie. The overall plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. But poor production, an obviously small budget, creepy that works from the protagonist, and several side actors really detract from it would be classic. An upcoming producer should try to revive this story and give this basic half-hearted excuse a correct release.
