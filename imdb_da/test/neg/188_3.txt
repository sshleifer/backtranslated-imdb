Luscious Candace Bergen as a prime Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the way !!! Earthy, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to tame a crazy, classic beauty like Candace is. . . Well, subjugating in the role. It is because, instead of having dialogue about the real problems ("you are a woman ... I am a man!") He must ask for "the will of Allah" and "the wind blows the fate of the desert sand." John Milius, A director known more for worshiping naked male bodies and brutal military strength than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relations has a crazy way to cut away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might be kissed. Instead of watching nature go the course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless (and I mean FINAL) shots by Brian Keith, who blinks his walrus size cheaters and delivers nasty sermons on the joy of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but seeing him try out his new rifle or talking about a great bear's heroic death, just don't span me like the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have. . . if ever it had started! The strange thing is that Milius spends most of his time building up characters and stories that have no solution. Candace's two young children in history both get more time on the screen than she does. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle, in any of what happens to her in the desert. Unless you think it's fun that her hair after weeks is perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment in history is when late evening Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a good sleep on soft pillows and says "we must escape." The little girl turns around and answers without a reply, "but Mom, I slept!" One line summarizes what is really missing in history. No danger, excitement or sizzle in the baseline, a cultured lady in captivity. She (and her children) are both so close and well looked after that it is hard to believe that someone has earned their fate. <br /> <br /> Remember, if Candace had said the line itself, it could have worked better. If the excitement stems from her enjoyment of her captivity (or her joy of being in Sean Connery's arms) and her guilt over all the problem caused by her abduction, history would have had tensions. But Milius makes it weird that the audience is just as reputed when he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt gets the chance to prove his crew three thousand miles away. In the end, the beautiful lady and her children do not seem to be worthy of him. . . And being in the center of history, it all seems to be rather dry and infinite. . . like the burning desert sand.
