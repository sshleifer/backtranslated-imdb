It is quite okay that people die in an animation, but there is just too much death in this. Beginning from the beginning is the story of fighting, fighting, death and revenge. It goes over and over again for an hour and a half. It was interesting at the beginning, but I was very tired after the show was halfway through. Unlike other animations, this lack of humor is. Also, there are not many interactions between the characters. The good thing about it is the sword war scene looks good and the characters look good.
