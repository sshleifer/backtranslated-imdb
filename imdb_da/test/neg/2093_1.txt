I can't believe anyone would green this let alone voluntary star in it. I will never be able to get it 90 mins of my life back. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad they are good. This has gone so far around again, it is somehow, it's so bad it's terrible. I don't expect it, it's a low budget, bandwagon jump, rehash of a B Movie, but it still got in the way of my expectation levels. Even television films have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogue, horrible acting and a completely inexplicable plot. Who cursed her and why, why are the 6 inch snakes turned into 15 foot snakes, has anyone ever heard of highly poisonous snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? So many promises, no one delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments want you to think this movie is worth watching over the last five minutes. It is not even worth renting. Keep watching a low-budget TV movie you will enjoy much more. <br /> <br /> Why was this made? Oh yes, that shameless deposit on the internet phenomenon that's SOAP. Shame on you, Mallachi Brothers, shame on you
