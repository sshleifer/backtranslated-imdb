I agree with all the comments so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy for both viewers and those who made it. Awful CGI, horrible script, stupid plot and hi, the setting is Alabama, but it looks like California. But the worst thing should be the Indian angle on this, which draws on every stereotype you can think of, from the boss surrounded by smoke, the angry anger, people talking without using contractions ("Don't do this thing!"), Native American pipes play in thin air, etc. It just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that I tear my hair out. An Indian with an ounce of self-respect would have thrown their TV out of the window by this bin. So in the end, I would say that this movie is basically an insult to everyone.
