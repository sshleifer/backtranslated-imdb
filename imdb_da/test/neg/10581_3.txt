Here is a spoof that guarantees to entertain people in the IQ series Homer Simpson. It's a cheap shot on every big superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it doesn't end there; It gradually gets worse until it dissolves in a pathetic ensemble of slapstick trolley of the truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in the plot, you only have to see Spiderman while it is affected by some heavy drugs. What do you get is Dragonfly Man ?? a boy wonder who loves the girl next door, suddenly inherits some overwhelming superpowers. The rest of the manuscript is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but not "take my word for it! For children, this is something entertaining; for adults it is a good movie to let the children out.
