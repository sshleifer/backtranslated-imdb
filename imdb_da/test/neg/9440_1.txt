... I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... This is such a slow POS that goes absolutely nowhere. Oh yes ok it goes somewhere but you see it coming from miles away. Effective: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes" because half of all the scenes could have gone in the box. Music: Don't let me start with the lousiest score I've ever heard. Who is singing in the last scene to cry aloud? Directly: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. Skip this one.
