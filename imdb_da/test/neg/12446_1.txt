Wow, this movie really sucked under the normal scale of boring, boring and imaginative movies I've seen recently. The action was poor and robot. The story was so bland that you could have summed it up with a simple 5-minute card. The sound was so bad and dirty, it was hard to even listen to; maybe it was unedited from the camera it was shot off? I'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers commented on, but it wasn't. Perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film got a good review, at least before the real reviews started to appear. <br /> <br /> Save your time or just waste your time and money on this movie. Absolute suction!
