Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe the only one who managed to get this up to 7, was a soft place for children with AIDS. But really people, the manly laughter and chaos during the retreat scene? Haven't you seen that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling over the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The action was fine, for sure. But for me it is just an example of a movie from a time when situations and issues could pass for film language. Things happen, but that's it. There is no glue or motif that can be detected on the screen, allowing the subject to use already existing emotional connections to the entire plot without the script doing it as it should.
