A terminally boring mystery thriller, which may sound pretty sound theoretical, but plays very badly. The ridiculous script is filled with (MINOR SPOILER) people die and then comes back to life when the plot demands them, and the director doesn't seem to be able to generate energy and excitement. The gooey sequence that kind of "explains" the movie's title is the only half way memorable in this tired movie. (* 1/2)
