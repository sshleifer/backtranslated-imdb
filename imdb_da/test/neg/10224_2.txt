This movie seems to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. All I hate about movies is present: false sentimentality, extreme corniness, poor child actors, and many features abundant. It ignores the fact that it portrays the extreme sports ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the casts fighting a football being shaped like a lemon. What?! It's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group with no hopes that get a new teacher they like (who also teach the class in a short skirt) and get them interested in football. Of course, they are all rubbish (don't forget, they are not hope) except a child who has moved from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc. Etc. And the kids are still not good football players, but a good heart follows and they no hopes become a bunch of well-rounded children. Hell, even adults are starting to get around; drunks are transformed into caring parents, illegal immigrants are beaten off the hook ... moan. <br /> <br /> This movie star Steve Guttenberg. Now, before you go into your local video store to grab yourself, stay awhile. Guttenberg is bad. No no; come on, let's see, how did that guy come to be in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either. She only seems to go through the movements and looks good when they do. Although I have no problems with the latter her performance makes the movie no credit. The children's actors who make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying, and it does not provide a pleasant display. There is a goat in the movie that plays the mascot and he does a good job; But you didn't want to watch a movie for a goat, so don't bother to watch this movie.
