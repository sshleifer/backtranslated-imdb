In 1990, I personally saw Kathy Ireland - I was with UNT in Denton during the recording of "Necessary Roughness". Strangely enough, the voice in this movie is not too far away from her real speech. <br /> <br /> In any case, the plot goes like this: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father has fallen into a bottomless hole in Africa. She goes and investigates the site of her father's death, only to be sucked into an underground world that is partially dystopian nightmare, some uninspiring imagination and inhabited by rejections from the Plasmatics. This movie really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who in my opinion could have been someone, had she got the one big role that was right for her. Anyway, history's most important hero, Gus, is a very lame Mark "Jacko" Jackson rip-off. The original is annoying enough to begin with, but this guy is really torture to see. Eventually, the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you want Kathy Ireland in a movie in skimpy clothes, it would be better to be a bikini. Still, the movie was just about bad and just skewed by MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if possible.
