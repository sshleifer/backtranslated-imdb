Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: The legendary South American sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is loose and feeds on someone who is unlucky enough to cross its path. Animal Commander Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert / writer Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) are trying to track the creature, but find their progress hampered by a few stupid police, money hungry locals keen to catch the beast for a bold reward, and scary scientists who want the monster for their experiments. Smelly higher than a two-week-old taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies can struggle to pass through. With his terrible script, horrible direction (of not one, but two talented hacks, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), ridiculous dialogue and some of the worst acting on this page of a porn girl, I recommend this movie as much as I drinking the water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlina continue their studies, viewers are treated to an incredibly weak act, the worst designed book jacket in history, the most compelling dead person I've seen since the flashing corpse in Dr. Butcher MD and a high-tech computer security system consisting of a keyboard attached to a post. <br /> <br /> To be fair to a guy in a rubber boot in himself is pretty scary (the hair with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are few and far between, and more screen time spent on the boring trials and hardships of whiney Officer Navarro than on killer antics of the titular creature (how many times is it necessary to see Navarro h and in paperwork for his bitchy boss?). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, make a mistake, wasting your hard earned money on this terrible latino bilge (in my case it was quite a 50 p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than to actually see it.
