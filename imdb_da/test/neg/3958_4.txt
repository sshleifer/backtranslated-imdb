This was probably calculated as an "arty" criminal thriller, but it fails both sides - there are few tensions and not enough fabric. The plodding pacifier makes it hard to sit through, and occasional action scenes are all too bluntly edited and confusingly set to offer much compensation. At least, the level of action is high.
