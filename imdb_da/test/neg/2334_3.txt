How much longer are we going to continue with this erroneous belief that when a director produces a major, groundbreaking work, all future work "may not be so bad, he did so". <Br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is a point in issue and is actually monster waste. The performances are excellent, especially from Watts and Theroux, but a good movie they don't necessarily do. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a movie that is unnecessarily sensible only works when it surprises the audience. When the audience expects the movie to make no sense, the film must have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the movie, with the murder mystery created with lots of twists and red herring, and then ... plop! The story falls into a twitter of bizarre halucinations and effortless stories. Methinks Lynch realized how confused the movie was getting and threw in the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake and to stop the male viewers from getting up and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie on the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no idea what was going on, but I left the theater to comment on "layers and layers" of Lynch's film production. Excuse me, but these people are the same nitwits who are in art galleries staring at canvas that has been painted white and commenting on "the courage of art to paint such a brave work". <br /> <br /> Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is acting on his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that opaque film is art, and therefore it must be good. I asked a number of Lynchophiles about what they really liked in the movie, and the only answer I received that was not a broad "layer" type of answer was that they liked it when "chicks got their kit away". <Br /> <br /> Nuff said.
