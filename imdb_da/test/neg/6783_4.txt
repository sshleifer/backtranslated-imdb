I watched this movie with a group of friends at the 1999 International International Festival in Melbourne, and no one had a good word for it. <br /> <br /> I happen to love bluegrass and country music so it's not as if I'm unsympathetic to the subject. But the problem is that it is a very conservative movie - a little more than a filmed Mills and Boon story. A bodice ripper of the simplest and most fussy kind. It is not just that the love story in its heart, that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a bit incredible. (Why any man would be attracted to the nostril-fluttering, humiliating Lily is beyond me, and honestly, Mike Harding, like Reece, seems to be just going through the movements). It is simply that the whole movie is too pretty and well-intentioned for its own good. There is precious danger, dirt or drama. Sure is a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is more fun than it is dramatic (it's just so badly written and acted). And the film confuses its conservative agenda in the way this subplot is resolved. <br /> <br /> As for good old Reece Kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask you! Is the end of this movie credible? Adapted to the character this film had previously built? I do not think...
