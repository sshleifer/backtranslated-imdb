A Delta Force Army unit intended to find a lot of missing green mountain injuries that are not known to go completely missed will be in a fight to survive against a combed skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archeologists disturbed his grave. The skeleton man runs a horse and has the ability to propel back and forth using a type of dimensional portal and is unaffected by firefighting and explosives. The skeleton's horse leaves no pride, and he can quietly sit behind and around his prey. The film's view through Skeleton Man's eyes looks at its prey with a different color. In other words, isn't he seemingly human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever) and his gang of wild commands stop this danger? For some reason, Skeleton Man kills the employees in a nearby chemical plant. What are Skeleton Man's motives for slaughtering endless people? And why is a blind Indian living in the forest, our commands resident, spared if Skeleton Man slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> So utterly silly as it sounds. Just incredibly terrible. This is the kind of movie that can kill brain cells. Casper Van Dien receives another billing in the credits just below the Rooker, but is saddled with a ridiculously signed character, leaving the film quite early. Rooker deserves better than this. If I was an actor, I would not have this movie in my CV. The Skeleton Man is a rejected temple knight from a de Ossorio movie. He has a spear that can only knock down certain people as he explodes a woman upside down. An arrow shot from the Skeleton Man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a helicopter plane. In almost 99% of the film shot at the Skeleton Man, and he can go in and out of the portal thingee yet, at the end he suddenly becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses also change as Skeleton Man freely moves through the forest from that portal. The movie is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, which should be experienced benefits, make real bad decisions throughout this movie. The mind boggles with this movie. Good for some laughs and some nice scenes make this hunk with pure crap wise as a garbage game.
