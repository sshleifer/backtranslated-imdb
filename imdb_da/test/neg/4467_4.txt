Being a Steve Martin fan for a long time, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. The printer writer should just have hired some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it's certainly the least imaginative movie I've seen for a long time - I knew exactly what would happen in each scene as soon as it started. The African American stereotypes and slave references are also quite offensive. But the worst thing for me was watching Martin in a movie without any trace. He is probably one of the most intelligent actors, and here he is completely sold out for a completely dumbed down script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort.
