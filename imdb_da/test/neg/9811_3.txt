Slaughter Trail is a B Western with some grand pretensions. But it has come down to Hollywood history for a most disgusting cause. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with its musical score that can only be described as indulgent, I have a sense of what Howard Hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was so reliable a B-picture cowboy hero ever, but he was not a singer. I think Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates shook with Roy Rogers over to the Republic and decided that he would also get one. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good performer and much better song writer was recruited and sang some of his material that was not his best and worse, looked like they were shoe-horned in the picture. But worse than what is this annoying choir that sang much of the story and honestly overwhelmed the actors, extras, even the horses. Needless to say, Terry should never be a singing king. But he wrote such classics as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's great hit, Memories are Made of This. The reason relates to an interior woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery. It is true that the criminals who are Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Gray in the coach as a passenger they receive words carry some valuable jewels. <br /> <br /> It's a good action Gray and Young pulls off. Young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate that is worse than death, and they do well out of the stage in the earshot of the passengers, but what he does is slip her swag. Last place the authorities can look if she doesn't run away with it. <br /> <br /> But when flying the robbery, it is on tired horses, so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement fittings and shoot three Navajos who protest It puts Navajos back on the warpath, not helping one of The accidents were Chief Ric Roman's brother. <br /> <br /> This is the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort has to deal with when coaches and banned arrive there for protection. How it all works is predictable, but on a great form of overproduction. <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem is with the slaughter track. It's a simple freak, B Western, which was souped up in something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real cause of the Slagningsp Trail in history is that this movie clearly marks the official beginning of the black list. Originally, Howard DaSilva was supposed to play Donlevy's part and could actually finish his scenes when Howard Hughes officially fired him into communist sympathies. His scenes were completely resumed with Brian Donlevy's lead. <br /> <br /> Considering what a failure this movie became, I'm not sure whether Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his private preserve.
