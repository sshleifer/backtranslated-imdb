I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt to see it, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to see the rest and again it put me in bed! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep everyone's interest alive. The only time it was a little more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with another disc containing bonus material. Needless to say, I didn't have a hard time reviewing the torture to see more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: The action was poor, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and so cheap, the direction was pathetic, and CGI visual effects were childish. <br /> <br /> To see Dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.
