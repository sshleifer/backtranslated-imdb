Well, I've seen "The Lamb's Silence" first .... but I think I'd be sick if I had seen it before this piece. Not from the cruel violence, but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal, and I really thought he was so psychotic when he played out to be, but from the audience's reaction around me, the movie was filled with clich√©s from "Silence" which left me lost on points where others laughed at what was on the screen. Now I heard that the movie would be very cruel and if the director wanted to break people out ... did he ... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be cruel, and I mean so cruel that you have to play the movie out of it ... you need more than 2 sequences. I always see it as a movie to either become the cinematic jewel, which eventually takes you to another place and time or either to go over the top (which most of the time is made in bad taste). But this movie left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are movie stars, right? Well, except for Hopkins, I didn't feel that way. Who worried about the stupid Italian police officer? I definatley not. So, really, the movie is back with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see Lektor and Starling again, but if you are going to a really good thriller .. You jump once and get exaggerated maybe twice. Depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about how much money this movie will bring ... there will probably be another "Hannibal" made, and this movie is unlikely to be in video this fall. If you need to see it .. Wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Don't spend the big money on this movie.
