"My blue sky" is boring. The reason is incomplete; The characterizations and dialogue stink; The musical tracks, while occasionally arranged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrical trite, painfully bright and emotionally hollow to the core. Managers, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; But despite their every talented effort to lift the drearing and uncomplicated material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less digits here. <br /> <br /> There is really only one reason to see "My Blue Sky". One reason ... a star: Mitzi Gaynor, in her movie debut. Her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but then what? Her pert and promising screen perspective, her catastrophic beauty and her unusual charisma shine through glorious and make these minutes the most reliable, memorable and exciting moments throughout the film. If you would appreciate a chance to see a huge young talent on the rise, check out Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Sky." <br /> <br /> By the way, I score (and encourage you to avoid) Drew Casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive DVD comment on this movie. Wordy, digressive, unfortunate, often ill-tempered with what is playing on the screen and galloping throughout with a surplus of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indestructible.
