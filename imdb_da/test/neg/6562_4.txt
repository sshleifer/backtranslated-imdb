That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Do not waste as in a waste of time (some time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in the waste of opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written that would have made a much better movie than the story Shatner chose. The setup was like an average TV episode, while the finish felt like the highlight (if you could call it that) of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Nimoy, who controls II-IV, focuses on the character of Spock - how he faced Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom and how he dealt with his emotional life now that he got a chance to begin fresh. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk that we didn't know before. Again one of the novels would have been better - try "My Enemy, My Ally" for a very interesting character study by our friend James T. The smaller characters are mostly used for sweet bits, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot seems way out of the left field, especially since the subtitle of the original series was Sulu-Uhura. Even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. Sorry, but that's true.
