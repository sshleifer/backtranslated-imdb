Let's see. What irritated me most? The extra-long dance scene at the beginning to watch people twirle around so much I became dizzy ... Without showing where the music came from ... All parts of a college exam that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie . Or maybe it was that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What a feature this movie is. And the most annoying aspect is that the bad guys are so bad, so of course terrible that it seems like the director made this movie for second degree. "These people are bad ... These people are good". When a movie has its agenda-heart on my sleeve, I'm next to myself. There is a scene in a skating rink that works out of place. Long-drawn love scenes with the protagonist and a Russian prostitute who look more like a rock star and his sexy bandage. John Hurt's character, which is part of the overrun start scene, drinks and disagrees with the exaggerated villains. His death scene might well be the stupidest thing in history. And I hear everyone, even the gentlemen in this movie, talking about how beautiful the cinematography is. I think it looks washed out. See "The Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This movie is even worse than anti-hype. It's meaningless. The epilogue, which shows the protagonist of a yacht, was almost as silly as the prolonged. The fighting scenes are dull and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you love bad movies because it's their king.
