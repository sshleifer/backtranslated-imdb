The movie started etc. A few tourists on holiday in Mexico are happy to decide that they should take a trip. They uncover some hidden paths and ends and this great temple as a fortress. Angry villagers are emerging and trying to deter them from climbing it, but because of the language barrier people are shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing. Turns out the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the villagers will not get close to, so they guard the temple so tourists cannot get off. There are a few scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I think they are PLANTS! Don't buy or rent Wait until it comes out on the cable.
