Isaac Florentine has made some of the best Western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. Especially US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell that Isaac has a true passion for the genre, and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp, with some of the best fighting sequences that an action fan can hope for. In particular, he has found a museum with Scott Adkins as a talented actor and action player that you could hope for. This is carried out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately the shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities. There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here than he has done this year, especially in the fight (virtually no reason) in a prison cell and in the final showdown with Scott, but looks in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything in the whole movie. And it's the leading man. There are other risky aspects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the biggest problem is that you are totally unable to empathize with the film's hero. A real shame as I know we all wanted this movie to be as special as it really could have been. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. This movie had a great instructor and action choreographer, and a great opponent for JCVD ​​to turn down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back to scratching in ball-out action movie stakes. Fortunately, a shame that this did not happen.
