Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan begins to slip under the sea. Initial predictions say it takes about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a villain scientist adds in some even more dubious sciences and decides that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government thinks he's a crackpot, but evidence soon begins to bear its theory. <br /> <br /> This big budget catastrophe follows the formula set by a number of Hollywood movies from the late 90s (I guess I haven't seen any of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bring the nobility of the human (well, Japanese) spirit into actions of heroism and sacrifice and prove the power of love or something. i.e. it is so naive in its psychology as it is geology ... we all know that half of the population would be raping and plundering the moment they thought the police had turned their backs, and the other half would just get panic and useless. /> <br /> The movie has some very nice special effects, but is not as slim or expensive as a similar Hollywood production would be. It's at least as nationalist, humorous and lacking in self-awareness as Hollywood movies would be, and probably has even worse plays. It has the hot evil chicken from Battle Royale as one of the leaders ... but she is not even a little evil and is therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long in 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses to a conclusion that was in danger of poaching. I absolutely didn't care whether Japan sank or not halfway, and just before the end I tried to think of ways to speed up the process if I ever found myself in that situation for real. <Br /> <br /> But it has nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I give it powerful ... 3/10.
