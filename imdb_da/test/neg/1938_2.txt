I haven't seen any jackass episode. It was mildly entertaining if nothing else happened. But after seeing Jackass # 2, I loved Bam and Dunn. They had a nice setting in the movie jackass, so I figured I would tune in to viva la Bam. Boy was I wrong. Seriously you can pair a bunch of 2's, give them the same budget and I bet they could beat something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At 23 where most people are set in, you give us this nonsense. Everything seems so forced. You do not know the signs because there is no attitude at all. You can't appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone for that matter. If there was just a little little thought. Something we do not forget as soon as the next shot continues. <br /> <br /> Finally, they are able to create a good shot and you like what is going on. You are sitting there, just waiting for their reaction, and then closing some moving scenes with two paralyzed sentences and scared. Was it close to the shot or what, please? If I had been there I would freak out and laugh. Do some crazy things and get my adrenaline pump, but these guys ... Just write stupid reactions. Yes, they get a few complaints from the audience at cheap coarse jokes or gigantic jokes, which in my opinion is such a waste of money. <br /> <br /> Many many normal people who were not taken under the Jackass wing could write a much more fun script in a heartbeat. Or impress with visual camera work. Even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull off a better job. MTV in a whim could bring more calming material to the screen. You just have to shoot the author of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes actually require a little courage and therefore 2 stars.
