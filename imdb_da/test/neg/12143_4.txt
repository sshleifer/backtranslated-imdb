I have to give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this out. Knowing this was a blaxploitation movie, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be a low budget ... the working pair ... but hoped for a few gems that had to sprinkle all the way through. If there were any diamonds or pearls sprinkled in this movie, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or maybe overactive. As an actor and filmmaker, I often jolted when potentially exciting moments were destroyed by horrible beliefs. Still, I must admit that I could not see away. I don't know if it was like a car wreck, you can't turn your eyes off, or any mysterious power in the movie that kept me there. This movie is a good case for an excellent story that was told incorrectly. If Walter Kronkite were to tell the "Aristocrats" joke, it would be a total flop even though the joke itself is fun. Let Dave Chappelle tell you, and we all roll on the floor and laugh. This movie needed a "Chapelle". Now with that said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar, I did. It's worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and re-add it. Who knows ... it can't be better, but it may not be worse.
