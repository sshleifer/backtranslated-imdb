I loved this movie when it first came out (but I was just 12 years old - and I forgot that this movie existed until I once found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to see this movie that I loved as a child, and when I watched this movie again many years later, it hit me .... Why in the world did I like this movie as a child, then it looked like an adult I realized that this movie is horrible.The shameful part about this movie is that they had everything to make the biggest Western ever and they blew it !!! The costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 musical results orchestral score is wonderful, and with the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger alive, the second score is a series of songs of country music most artistic like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and the songs like "The Man in the Mask" are so bad they are This movie The biggest point is that it had a b riliant history and one of the best western ern plots ever, and for a while it is fun to see when John Reid is the nurse back to health after he and his fellows are falling. It's fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the Lone Ranger as he conceals his identity and vengeance for the gang to be responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers for whom he rode. But unfortunately, as good as the story, it's all destroyed by Merle Haggard Narrating everything you see happening (for God's love why did they do that?) Between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers, corny sings (stupid) songs like "Ride little cowboy" "playing in backgound makes this movie impossible to take seriously. I would love to see a really good producer take the same script and story and restore this movie right because in the heart of this silly movie is a great western .--- I would descibe this movie as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothes . I give it 4 stars out of 10 - if you are 12 years old and don't know better then you can love it.
