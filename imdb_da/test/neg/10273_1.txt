I am relieved, the later reviews have become sour - reading all positive feedback, I began to worry that my understanding of film (and life) was quite different from everyone else in the world. Everything in this movie rang fake for me ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny tale, all. As each scene unfolded, I thought, "People don't work like this." It is relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. In a sense, I think the movie bully you to like it, or pretend to like it, because it is serious and about real people and confronts problems. But man, it really didn't work for me.
