Predictable, clich√©, unbelievable, boring ... what else can I say? Only the caliber of the caliber saves any redeeming qualities of this inflated root. Oh yes, and the entertaining end zone antics. <br /> <br /> But wait for eleven o'clock because the result is as predictable as who will win the Globetrotters / Washington Generals matchup. <Br /> <br /> I was well into the other act before I found out that these should be PRO teams we looked at (all dressed in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz's character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was mistreated on the side. (Not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go for dinner?) <br /> <br /> Enough of this - I'm just on the run because I was looking forward to this movie. Rent the longest place in the place. <br /> <br />
