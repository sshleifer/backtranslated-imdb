Another successor! Why on earth do they continue to make these? This has to be the weakest "franchise" ever, but it is still being funded and spawned by successors. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only looked at, so that I could officially destroy the whole series - brings back the evil straw man who again slaughters some college children ... That's basically it. The play sucks (as usual), death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title. This thing doesn't have as much nudity as you might think. A pair of fine topless girls, but nothing for pants tightening. Just let me conclude with my continued insult (or review) on this movie by saying: If I come across a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the video store shelves, I will be in absolute admiration ...
