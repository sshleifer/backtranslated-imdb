I should explain that as far as this trend is going to tear off Asian horror movies, this Shutter is a head over The Grudge and Dark Water, while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness as The Ring establishes. <br /> <br /> Although movies, like life, do not exist in a vacuum and therefore are up to comparison with other thrill / thriller / horror movies. Honestly, I am not writing an elusive synopsis here and would say that this movie is trying to rely on music-induced "scare" frightens rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself is not so remarkable. The reason is pretty basic and predictable and is nothing to write home about either. While there are some exciting scenes that adjoin creatively scary, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. If you've had The Grudge and it's ilk then you like it. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
