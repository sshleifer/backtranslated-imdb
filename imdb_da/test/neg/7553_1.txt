No wonder so many young people have distractions. It seems that the stage (dance) productions these days are about how many cameras and camera angles a director / editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try counting them sometimes for something else to do with this, otherwise totally incomprehensible show. <br /> <br /> I tried to make at least some faces from some of the other dancers in the production. It was impossible. They didn't seem to have any faces, just blurs - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's just coffin (nice shine!), Michael Flatley's feet, and the patented Flatley's over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity power. When he was an executive producer of this cutting and cutting job, I assumed it was expected. You don't have to wonder too much about who his target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production as it attempted to present the show virtually as one could see from the audience, not the catwalk, side wings or floor spike perspective. If I am not mistaken, I think Sir Michael has retired. Thank goodness for small blessings.
