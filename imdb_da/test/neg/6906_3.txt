I took my 4 year old twins to watch this movie today and I would not recommend it to children, their age. <br /> <br /> This movie had many fighting situations throughout it which I found violent and my kids found scary. <br /> <br /> The subject was far above my children's heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon aimed at children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we all looked forward to seeing this, but it just didn't hurt. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The extreme also made me mad during the whole movie.
