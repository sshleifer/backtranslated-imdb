I would recommend putting this in the "skip it" pile too. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancé rented it, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman instructed it. Ah, well ..... The costumes were cozy, but they were typical. There was nothing about those who said they were from anywhere but the Costume Department period in a major Hollywood study. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - all dressed as if they were in court in Versailles. The sets somehow did not evoke the qualities of the settings - the prison did not feel like a prison, but the mansions did not feel like mansions, and from the outside the scenes looked as if they were filmed on a backside, for all they had was probably practical locations . <br /> <br /> The result was dramatically less than it could have been. I've been a fan of movie results since my youth, notice, appreciate, and gather them as I mean more than John Williams. My fiancé is a professional film composer, an award-winning artist who has been performing his works at Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the start of the movie we had great hopes for it, and it actually started out nicely. It was rapidly deteriorating, and on several points - including the release of the prisoners - it actually reached an annoyance level. In fact, I reached for the remote to turn down the volume. The score was never more than the most obvious choice to score a particular tone in the scene and did not integrate into the "soul" of the movie (think of the music in Babel and you want an idea of ​​what I mean). It never achieved the greatness it wanted, but then the film did not. Javier Bardem was as talented as he was, horrible. For the first part of the film, his way is so distracting that it takes over his performance. In the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by a completely different set of annoying ways, and he resembled Keith Richards and Stuart Townshend's Lestat. I never got the idea that he was worried about the role (that is, the character cared for his life and actions) or that the sign was ever drawn by the authors as something more than an opportunist who for some reason changes and decide to stick to its principles at the end. Natalie Portman was very good, though her performance lacked shades of growing madness between her release from prison and taking Lorenzo's hand at the end that I would have needed to call it really an effective performance. Alien's character was never defined enough to really distinguish, and if it wasn't for the amazing makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning and the end of the movie would not know that they were not the same character. The prosthetic teeth were terrible, artificial and distracting, but there are no knocks on Mrs Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was nice as Goya. Not Oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally trustworthy. I don't know much about Goya's life or his deafness, but it seemed to be sticking to the movie as a demand for biographical information, rather than something used in the movie. I'm sure it affects Goy's life a lot more than just requires the need for an interpreter, but you would never know it from seeing it here. For the plate, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted about 30% of the time through lip reading. <br /> <br /> Let me not start with Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. The scripture is read as one of "Choose Your Own Adventure" books that I used to read as a child: for several moments through the movie there are more outcomes, and none of the actions before them lead to any certainty to the way the movie actually plays out. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its modest attempts to raise the mood through small pieces of humor. Knowledge of the hands? Maybe it's because I paint (not well) as a hobby and know what a PITA hand should draw / paint, but I saw the joke come a mile away, as well as the reproduction in the other half. Was the child ever there for any reason other than being taken by Ines? There could just as well have been a number of breadcrumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (Note: This review is a copy of an answer I made for a thread in the forum)
