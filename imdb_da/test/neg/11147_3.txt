The reason for this boils down to Ah-null versus Satan, and what I remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions, rifles, blood, noise and let's not forget the flammable satanic urine. The story is nonsense, completely predictable, and so full of holes I couldn't take a bit of it seriously. Stick to "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a really good devil movie and .... I can't think of any good "Action" movies at the moment (probably because they are so far and apart ), so you are alone in that category. This flick gets a 3 out of 10 rating from me for his camp value, and for a pretty good performance by Gabriel Byrne as the old debbil Satan!
