Sure, I like some indie movies. Much, actually. I don't always understand them, and that's okay. Not all of them were supposed to be understood, especially by mostly streamed people like me. I'm probably showing my ignorance, but I'm still puzzled why the Book of Revelation says it. I love these world stories and the only thing I could see is like the end of the world, and this movie was the torture it took to get through this. I'm not talking about the subject; Perhaps I have been subdued by all the other torture / porn I have seen. It was just the incredibly slow story, an hour of 15 minutes stretched for almost two hours. (Major spoilers are ahead) The Hetero-man dancer is abducted, seduced and raped six ways from Sunday, or in this case 12 days of three hoodies. After his release, after his slightly confused dancer / girlfriend barely flogged (except losing a glass) after wondering what she missed more: him or the cigarettes she originally sent him to during the abduction. Yet in a state of sensible shock, he refuses to speak, and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing has happened and he takes a well-needed shower. Problem. As much as he is bothered by flashbacks to his, uh, "attack," he is just as awakened. Granted, I have not been tied and used as a toy, but I doubt I would really "be in the mood". Oh, I forgot, and how does he try to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as possible to try to spot the birthmarks or tatteries that the criminals had. I see where they go with it ?? Show a gang of rape from the male POV. Well, twist no matter you could never feel for this guy. Only rescue grace was the good play of LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor. But she couldn't save the movie herself.
