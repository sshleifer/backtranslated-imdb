SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I don't go into "high tech" movies that expect them to be 100% accurate on all things, computer related. But somehow even the average computer that I have a computer has to believe in it: <br /> <br /> 1) A computer professional with top secret, special data <br /> <br /> 2) is will keep the primary copy of the mentioned data on a 1.44 floppy <br /> <br /> 3) and do absolutely no back-up of this particular secret data. <br /> <br /> Even high school students back up their homework for good. <br /> <br /> This is also the worst representation of a computer geek ever. Although she is super sweet, we must believe that she does not have friends, neighbors, extended family or colleagues who can identify her. Even the unabomber had a family that could beat him in. END SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not just minor flaws that didn't matter to the movie - This is the main plot pointing to the idea of ​​the tank being burned up. The characterization was horrible, plotted totally unbelievable, and if you haven't seen this, don't bother.
