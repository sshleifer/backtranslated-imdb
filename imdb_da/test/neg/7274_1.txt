Lord, this sucked. There is a special kind of sexual revolution war from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This movie is an example. I wasted a look at how many times women are beaten, hit, whipped or spanked in the movie. And then there are all the times that women in the movie fantasize about being beaten, hit, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it's apparently part of safe fetish play-acting. Other times it is clearly not, but you will in vain wait to see the heroine report to the authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we hear that she is being presented by the rapist about her inability to "let go". <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie reeks of misogyny (talking like a right, white, married man in his late 30s, not a teenage lesbian women's study with a chip on her shoulder so you don't get the wrong idea.) <br /> Perhaps the one good thing about this movie is that it gives a powerful reminder of how bad things really were for women a few decades ago.
