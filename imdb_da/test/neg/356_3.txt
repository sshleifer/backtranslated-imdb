Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Master Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role seems compelled and even unpleasant rather than fun. The movie itself is crowded with mahkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham references to religious beliefs and American patriotism that comes out as exaggerated rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does its best with a bad script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial priest and gets nothing to do. The child's actor is led by a talented child who shows a flat influence throughout the film. His only claim to praise as a performer is obviously a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. But once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't have to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in the majority of movie scenes. I find this child so annoying that I jump forward when he comes up. Since he has many scenes in this movie, it means I jump through a lot of movies. There were and are so many talented children's actors; It's a shame that this movie doesn't have any of them in it. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional wide-hat hat and shorts is worth a look.
