Fortunately, you don't need a lot of "book learnin" to understand where this thing goes ... Of course, a poverty line into Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just a year earlier) finds this always -watchable George Zucco in a another of his patented "mad doctor" roles as brilliant, revenge-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up the store deep in the marshland of what I suppose is Louisiana bayou, aims at revenge over four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to retire from his previous work. You see, they scoffed at his claim to be able to mix man with animals to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would benefit during the war. Fortunately, Cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections - a hollow, child-like half-white named Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty clueless about what's going on, doesn't ask too many questions and lets doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with what's happening in his syringe. This results in a time-lapse change of man turns into a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the mansion use a secret passage, so you get pretty much a big guy (Strange was 6'5 ") dressed in overalls with a shrub beard, hairy paws and a set of oversized plastic ducks running around the forest are the most After an eyewitness sees the animal and a little girl is killed, the locals take their rifles and organize a pose to hunt it, Dr. Cameron who can control the animal with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse The effect, too, draws Petro together to the metropolis to try to track the professors who had mocked his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process, as well as hanging in the house is Cameron's daughter Lenora Anne Nagel), as well as Lenor's nosy reporter girlfriend Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first tendency is to deal with an upright prehistoric creature (!) <br /> <br /> Although a typical chintzy PRC flick in many ways with unimpressive sets, filmography and ma Ke-ups, as well as a rather bland cast molding, are still durable thanks to the star George Zucco's histrionics. I have no idea why Downs received top billing; He shows up for half an hour and really doesn't have much to do, nor is it so impressive to do so. This is Zucco's show all the way, and he's amazing ranting and raving, talking to himself as he fantasizes that he's talking to his peers ("I'm not interested in your imecilic mouths!") And temporarily sliding in and out of reason. Strangely appearing to have patterned his performance as the hilarious naive and slowly talked half-retarded land bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of Lon Chaney Jr. in turn, as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a good job of each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of a colleague, while Petro is sitting there laughing and staring at a doorknob. Some of the foggy swamp scenes are also quite atmospheric.
