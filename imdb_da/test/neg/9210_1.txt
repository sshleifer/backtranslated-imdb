There must be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. <br /> <br /> It was painful to see, but strangely convincingly the same. Compelling because it seemed incredible that a movie could actually suck so much. I continued to think "it needs to be better." It got worse. And worse. <br /> <br /> Where on earth were people amazed at producing such a categorical junk I will never know. The most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews I see from people who actually love the movie. Yes, the play was good, but the movie was very very very bad. Worst movie ever!
