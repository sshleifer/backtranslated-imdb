This movie started well enough and held onto the mood of the book pretty well, even though the play was not top notch. The soundtrack was tortured badly. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gritty unnoticed. The female singer was positively boring! In the second half of the film, the story takes a certain darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey made a dark and scary place while in the drawer it was disappointingly pretty and modernized for Catherine's eyes. Who in heel is this Marchioness with the awful makeup and wig? A completely foreign and unnecessary character. One of the main elements of the book is General is not a Gothic monster as the characters in Catherine's books. His monster is far more complicated in his repression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not unlock his wife or kill her, but he sends Miss Morland alone on a 70 kilometer trip in a rented cart with not enough money to pay home. Only her friend, Miss Tilney's consideration of handing her some money off the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point is seriously confused in the movie. They make the general too dark from the start. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth shouldn't have sung! This part was painful to see. His portrayal of Tilney was not that bad, but it was a shadow dark in places. Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland's fantasy on a trip to Northanger, but he was never dark. The Firth would have enjoyed better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better actor. John Thorpe was appropriately boring. The striped vest and coattails combo he wore were horrible! It certainly fits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the movie would have been much better with a completely different soundtrack. It throws an oppressive pole all over the film. If I see it again, it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Maybe I would give the movie a 4 da. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was rather poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is clearly noticeable on a digital TV. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this movie might have been, I'm thinking of persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
