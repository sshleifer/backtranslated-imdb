<br /> <br /> I watched this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge audience of real fantasy fans. At about the middle of the movie, part of the audience slept and the other part was booeing. Drilling dialogues, poorly choreographed battle sequences, a horrible stupid story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors didn't have much to do, except to look worried or (if they were female) showed their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was among the audience admitted afterwards that it could understand the disappointers' disappointments. Be warned, people, of the cheapest fantasy film ever ........
