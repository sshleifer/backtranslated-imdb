This season lacked real oomf, but when it comes to setting up stories to get us back to mood, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity. This season lacked its usual Sopranos style, and if you cut out all the waste that was filled in every episode this season, you would probably have had 6 episodes worth of real stories. Side stories like Pauly's mother, is she or is she not? was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character. I would have liked to see Bobby expressing his anger more on Pauly in the carnival episode, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> And that's just it! These side stories had no real intention and lacked finishing. If they are to complete these stories in the next 6 episodes, I'd rather not see it, because it's not really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Disappointing is that nice word to say about this season and its finals.
