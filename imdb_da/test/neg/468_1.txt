What a waste of a movie again the film industry does not trust to make a movie that could have been just about man's ideas. there is virtually nothing about his theories or evolution, but instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with a daughter, an overwhelming script, great freedoms taken with Darwin's life, dialogue of his character, which I find hard to believe he would have voted. Darwin never gave his belief in a higher power, he cannot quite have believed in the established Christian idea of ​​God, but was not an atheist. as this film implies. What would have been a fast-paced and much better movie is if they had begun publishing the origin of the Origin and constructed a story of the great revolution that led and a fantastic cast of character involved on all sides. instead, we got a plodding, boring drama that mainly consists of a great injustice
