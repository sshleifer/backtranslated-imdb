Since I didn't have a TV and had never heard of this mini-series, I didn't know what to expect from the second coming and rented it clean because of its plot synopsis, which sounded interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Every saying is calculated.) If anyone told me this was written by a thirteen-year-old class who had the project turned the other into a school game, I wouldn't have been surprised. <br /> <Why, why did they decide to portray Jesus Mark II as what constituted an idiot Savant? Is there anything in any of the Gospels to suggest this? Okay, an ordinary block, but a great northern moron. I do not think. <br /> <br /> Apparently, everybody made Jesus impress people, his miracles, because accordingly, his sermon surely takes hell, never impressed anyone. Surely, without the night to daylight, Jesus Eccleston had been floundering without a canoe, a paddle or any kind of follow. <br /> <br /> And the odd little gay polemics sat down in the will-dust, without rhyme or reason. Except, of course, Russell is waving to his QAF fan base. Jesus turns up in the pub to recruit disciples (more helpless northern losers and, of course, the homosexual writer's standby - the harp woman, nag, nag, nagging away). Homosexual rights are thrown into the throat for no real purpose, almost as Russell thought he "owed it to the boys" to put Jesus on the spot. <br /> <br /> I can't really see the real Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing against it personally, buddy." Only a real middle class and woolly could imagine Jesus being quite wet. <br /> <br /> Don't start me at the end. "Come in and eat the rat poison, because the only way we can really be free is if God dies." It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates. "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out that my global dominance is cramping your style, I'll give everything to you, my customers." And of course I eat the rat poison. <br /> <br /> I'm often mystified by the ratings on IMDb, but the high rating on this one takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> Never mind Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for brainless MTVs. <br /> <br /> God helps us all right.
