We've given this movie a star too horrible, but it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently looking at Channel 5 at. 3.30, and we have not stopped laughing, so maybe we could give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. Right from the beginning, with the 'manic' thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion, we were laughing. Is it me or that chick from Knott's Landing looks like one of the characters from Dark Crystal. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to ruin it for you, but you'll have to be pretty stupid not to see it come, I don't think it's wise enough for double bluffs. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst / best movie we've ever seen, if we had played the "spot clich√©" drinking game, then we are wasted now.
