The original Road House was a classic cheesy 80s movie, which although not anywhere near the prize worthy of writing or performing, was a very entertaining and popular movie, mainly due to the presence of the star Patrick Swayze and the great support casting along with some excellent fighting scenes and eye cakes. 16 years later, and MGM / Sony is trying to recreate the magic that left us all citing a liners and reciting the three rules for jumping ... with a movie citing the best lines of all originals and reciting the three rules. <br /> <br /> This was an amateur fanatic movie, it would be a loving greeting to one of the most popular of Swayze's movies. As a professionally made movie, it falls flat on the one who turns into the DVD Bargin Bin, with its persistent re-use of lines and plot from the original movie becoming an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original. <Having said this with new lines like "I'll kill you like I killed your father," I wonder myself that the writers decided to rehash much of the original script. <br /> <br /> I knew this was never something special to be right for a DVD sequel, but at least I was hoping there might be a few new ideas and fresh things to do live up to the Road House name, but what you get is simply a 2006 remake of the same movie, with a little drug added. <br /> <br /> If I was the director, I would have removed all references to the first movie so as not to infect the original and that is the sign. As it is, we got Patrick Swayze's character, now to be dead (killed by the screen in a lame way by Jake Busey) and his brother and son now the protagonists, who hardly have completely different surnames. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was that Dalton's son drove the same car his father did, a really cool tribute, even though it was later destroyed by having the car meet its end, just like the one predecessor did. It is a good example of how this film goes too far, including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane "just as I killed your father" and then continue to try to send him in a completely different way. Great writing there. I see that Schaech is listed as a co-screenwriter. Stick to shopping or preferably nothing. All in all, it is an OK movie if there is nothing else to see and you want to turn off your brain for half an hour and a half or if you have retreat I've seen the first Road House, but hardcore fans of Swayze's Classics are quite disappointed almost to the point where they feel offended by how much of a rip off this movie is the first. Who once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this movie, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he doesn't want to see this!" Stick to the original Road House and relive the good old Swayze days!
