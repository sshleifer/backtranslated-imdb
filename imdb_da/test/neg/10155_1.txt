O boy, this was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this on video tapes. In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to hear the person at the other end. It turned out that at least two different kinds of movies or video files were used, because the colors and focus sometimes changed drastically between edits. And there were many out of focus shots that didn't seem to be intentional. <br /> <br /> An indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report came on TV. There is only one "news flash" title card that is heavily overlaid with a video effect on a television screen and a voice-over of a news machine. They couldn't shoot recordings of a news machine and then actually show it on the TV? <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a killer carrying surgical scrubs and masks wearing a scalpel. He is apparently a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him. <br /> <br /> Students are knocked out of school for a break and three young women decide to have a dormant party. Three guys decide to break down the party, and a geek named Science decides to collide it too. The sleep party is rather boring, and the guys continue to show blurred masks, turn off the masks and then disappear. The mother and father (the surgeon who was going to make the lobotomy) at one of the girls continue to show up. The killer is slipping human neck without anyone really noticing it. The apparent lead in the film sleeps more or less through the film. Maybe it was bad to act, or maybe it was intentional, as much of the movie is a nightmare and some of it is a nightmare in a nightmare. The end is also horrible. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box art that was revived to DVD release (a dual feature with Terror at Tenkiller). I honestly can't tell if it's a photo or a painting, or a combination of both. The women in the picture are not in the movie, and the clothes they wear are far more revealing than anything the women in the film had. The neck cuts on the deck are frightening than those in the film - where people tend to affect a greasy pop-eyed look. For that matter, that's what the killer has most of the time: the head hilly and the eyes bugging, crushing to the camera. The scalpel was often kept close to the camera in focus, while the murderer's masked face was in close-up but out of focus in the background.
