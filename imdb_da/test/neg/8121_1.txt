Seriously ... I'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here. All we have in this show are two stupid kids who continue to make an annoying laugh, and they do OCCASIONAL fun stuff only as ... 2 of the performances while most others sucked ... then comment on the music videos that I can't stand personally while they either love or like. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, the only things you want to hear are repeating "let's score with some chickens" or "I kick your ass beavis" or the better yet and usually used quote "it was cool "and above all their annoying laughs. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to see this horrible MTV series truthfully.
