If you are a fan of the ten original bids, this movie will make you cry inside. given, i'm only about. 1/2 hour into it at the moment, but it's so painful, I felt it was my duty to warn the right ten bud fans before being subjected to this bastardization. I didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake shows me wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, the melodramatic life-time movie mode and the styled we-wax-figures-come-to-life recordings make me hope they will rewrite the plot and drown the moses in the Red Sea.
