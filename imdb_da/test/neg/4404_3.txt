I was very worried about this movie, it was scheduled to play at a Jewish film festival and was reported to be very hostile to Israel while using smart humor and irony. I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, but as a film work, it was deeply disappointing. The film was full of random events, some of which joined each other, most of which didn't. Some of the events were very clever and fun, but some were just random and meaningless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers, sitting in a car, wordless and playing some handheld games. Perhaps in some cultures this is erotic, but it is like seeing thumb breaking. After the third time it became really tiring. I have always found David Lynch to be completely bizarre, using strange stories and pictures to make the audience believe he is so sophisticated that they do not understand his work; In fact, there is nothing to understand. The same is true here, the stories do not add anything, and there is not much of a political point being made (in one scene, a violent Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. It's news?) <br /> I do not understand why this film has gained controversy, nor why it has received attention. It is a subordinate work and it was a waste of time.
