1. Watched 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): Fair Adventure movie based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick's fame, Herman Melville. This film is about the captain of a ship that had stolen his eyes (it was extremely rare black beads) from a native tribe's god sculpture and saved them a place he only knew before leaving the island of Tivi. He became very ill and was on a secret journey to return to the island to retrieve the beads himself, while others (like his daughter) thought he was going to be treated by the local medicine man. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip - turning your eyes to their God. The stupid part is that the beads were hidden very close to the statue, and all the time the natives went on their tribe without their God eyes (causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way we are treated (for some reason) to a short underwater nature exhibition with an electric eel fighting with a local squid (I think only Herman Melville knows what it was all about). When they come to the island, the captain dies but passes the pearl's residence to his daughter, but she also gets the disease. One of the evil guys finds out where the god is at home and convinces the daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at this point the good guys find out what is happening and a fight arises. I don't want to tell you the results of the fight or the ending, I leave it for you to find out if you want. As I said earlier, the movie was ok, but some very stupid things that I have already mentioned reduced its impact. I wonder if the new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got some of that plot from this one --- hmm ?? black beads, a curse (I'm wondering?) Well, it doesn't matter that these items didn't create a very good movie in this case or the other. It seems that they would learn that they are lessons, but with the money that rolls into the newer movie, I'm sure they won't. Oh good.
