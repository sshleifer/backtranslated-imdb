The only reason I saw this movie another time was to learn the name of the other banana girl who played against Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. Never heard of her before. She is lovely. Captivating. With an animated face and sweet bid, she is very attentive ... She has genuine, "Poisenality" ... More than a passing mood of Grace Kelly ... with youthful adultery. I think she is Irish in gene pool, (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that she will look like the most beautiful Irish American. The film is unremarkable, Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, she was about 25 years old. This reminds me of another silly, worthless movie, where the only release is the Pretty Girl in it. It was "Career Opportunities" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Fat II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
