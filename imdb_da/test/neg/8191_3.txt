I accidentally happened on this movie when I was looking for something to see while eating lunch. I actually turned to the WE network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of "sticking it" for some gymnastics teams - I expected cheesy goodness. Well, I got cheesy okay. <br /> <br /> First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. Fortunately, most of them resumed quite quickly, especially in the bedroom scene, where Crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rampage. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and want to see her in almost everything. She is just so beautiful, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as she always does. She looks great throughout this movie and is not really over what seems to be more than a decade. <br /> <br /> All in all, I felt bad for the actors when I watched this movie. Everyone tried to sell their parts, but everyone was so poorly written that it was a constant battle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's Dharma & Greg's father) in this. <br /> <br /> But the writing wasn't the worst part of this movie. In half an hour before the end, her mother dies, and when they show the headstone, the date of death is 1979. After missing the start, I had the impression of the wardrobe that this took place in the 80s. Not a casual wear or bell bottom in sight. Shame on the person who made the wardrobe for this movie! Don't make me wrong - all the clothes in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the time. It almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe that it was a while. Bottom line - good for a laugh or feeding a Jennie Garth fix. :)
