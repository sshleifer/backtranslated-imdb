'Ernest saves Christmas' is comedian Ernest's Christmas movie. In this film, Ernest will find a sequel to Santa Claus so that Christmas can continue. Along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important for Santa's (I will not tell you what it is, you just have to watch the movie itself). Like most Ernest movies, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best movies. It's fun and it has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not be afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie around, but it is a good thing to get you at Christmas. It's a little sad that the movie is a bit dated now.
