Sequels, well, there are many reasons to make them, but what went through Irwin Allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical conditions. There are so many open responses to this movie that it is ridiculous ... like The Poseidon, a monstrous ship with passengers, driving on the sea and just Michael Caine with my mini-bar and a bad Telly Savalas discovering the boat ... well , in the beginning the French sea is circulating over the wreck with their helicopter, but as a sinking cruise ship is a daily thing, they just fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine boarding with Sally Field and he can pick up everything he sees (diamonds) if there wasn't a Telly Savalas looking for weapons on the ship ... my God, why am I actually releasing my word here? It's ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine were involved, which makes you think about what went through their thoughts when reading scripts .... certainly not diamonds ....
