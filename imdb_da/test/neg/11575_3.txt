Bad, bad, movie, so bad is it worth seeing. As long as you look at this movie and knowing it's bad and you'll spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy, and the animals look fake, and the play is bad, but seeing the actors' faces as they try to look scared is just a lot of fun. If your sister is being eaten by a giant komodo dragon would you not do anything to try to save her? If she was eaten, wouldn't you fall on your knees and cry out your heart? This guy sat right in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climatic is it? Maybe he should be in shock or something. He goes with his sister in komodo's stomach - that doesn't mean destroying it for you.
