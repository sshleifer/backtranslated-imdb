A by-the-numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non-fidelity and the use of the term "blackwater." The cinematography appears right out of the basic cable MOW country, which removes any kind of spongy, creepy atmosphere from the case. In addition, there are not nearly enough, sex or attractive young things to satisfy the majority of the film's targeted viewers. That said, the actress who plays the occupied man leads a sexy olive-skin presence. What should be said about this non-winner? Don't let rent unless you have something for middle-aged adults who regret their past and rank with clich√© clergy, shrink, his Latin staff members all regret their past actions.
