You don't have to worry when you look at the DVD's cover, Sandra Bullock only appears for a maximum of 5 minutes in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> Just to mention a few of the many highlights that should be aware of: <br /> <br /> - They condemned evil voices from the top bad guys - The special gun cam - The weird masks and outfits of hit killers - The flashy ways to catch a ball and hit the ground - The surface of the bottom-up shot - Spacey scene where Bullock falls unconsciously on the street - Over-clich√© Italian mob guy Moe (LaMotta) - The Cheap Synthesizer Background Music - The Fascinating overdone gun fetishism <br /> <br /> And last but not least: super corny nist fight scenes. Wanting there would have been more of them ... <br /> <br /> Extra point for the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
