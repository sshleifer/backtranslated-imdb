Contains great spoilers, on the off chance you would actually break the story line. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker that clobbers the mains. <br /> <br /> Predictable schlock from the start, and if not enough, it kills 5 seconds of action between the movie and the commercials, which little excitement might have been. For example: Will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dull when we go to a commercial and the action shot before the ad shows them jumping around inside the plane! Well, I guess they'll do it all, but then they had to go again because they're good guys. The action was not too impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy), the effects were a little lame, the evil guys got it, and the good guys came through. The real disaster in this movie was the script, especially the end. Not only did they happily wrap as fast as a soap opera with 24 hours notice of a cancellation, but they intentionally glorified the hacker. So he caused a bazillion death ?? he meant well. And of course, an uplifting final TV report on people coming together. Vomit. It was all I expected from the advertisements, and I'm glad I wasted my time watching it. It will make a good conversation at the lunch table tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Is CBS insulting doing this? Sure, but we saw it, didn't we? Did you count many ads that were for home backup generators under this pig? <br /> <br /> Here we hope for the next Plan 9 from the outer space (which gets better with each view). This is not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
