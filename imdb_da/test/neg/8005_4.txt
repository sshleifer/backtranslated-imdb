Circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of turns and evolved better, the movie has a very gifted casting that mostly works well, but it loses the audience basically, everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are reluctant someone else and working with .... do I lose you? well the movie is even more confusingly clearly written by a first-timer writer, it has some redeeming qualities, although in the play especially Famke Janssen shines like Lily but unfortunately much USELESS screen time just stands there doing nothing ..... the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents are sometimes annoying, but it is still worth watching if you are a fan of one of the actors, especially John and Famke, who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing every second ....
