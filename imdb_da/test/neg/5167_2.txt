It was like watching the trailer for an upcoming movie, except that there was no movie that came up. The film is so unsatisfactory and of course unfinished that it is almost ridiculous. The subject of this movie is over a very short time frame, and honestly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes on the screen. I was hoping for the final Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they were fighting incredible odds in horrible conditions. This is certainly not the case. <br /> <br /> That said, the actors were large and authentic. This could easily have been a good movie with much more money and time, but it's not even mediocre, and I can't recommend it at all.
