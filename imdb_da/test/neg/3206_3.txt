Critters 4 starts, and I quote 'Somewhere in Kansas 1992' and a repeat of the last few minutes of Critters 3 (1991) when Charlie McFadden's recurring character (Don Keith Opper) is shooting the last two remaining Critter eggs in the Universe As we are informed, would mean the eradication of the entire Critter breed, which is against a kind of intergalactic zoological law or something. Charlie's bounty hunter friend Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Counselor Tetra & is a top-ranking employee of intergalactic council & orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them in a pod that will land nearby very soon, pod Lander actually very fast nearby, and Charlie actually puts the eggs into it, but he is also trapped in the graft, which I suppose the cryogenic ally freezes him, as never explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are 'Somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045', where a salvage ship crosses the podium that drives in space (the credits are almost unfinished.) Critters 4 already steal whole ideas and scenes from foreigners ( 1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod & try & get some money out of it. With the help of his crew member, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe) are grafted fresh. They come in contact with the intergalactic council and advise Tetra to go to an abandoned space station where there will be action for grafting and it's content, Tetra also specifically tells Rick that he doesn't open the podium. So in true horror movie tradition, Rick opens the pod, defeats the Charlie and Critter eggs that close, kill Rick & escape in the space station ... Co-produced and directed by Rupert Harvey I believed Critters 4 was a rather useless movie and rounding off the Critter series of movies with a snap rather than a bang. The manuscripts of Joseph Lyle & David J. Schow are both predictable and clich√©d, the space station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours, the protagonists are only emergency aids that are neutralized early so they are stuck against time to save himself, the constant bickering & argue among the crew, the division of people and the loser who turns into a hero and saves the day, yawns. A lot of plot units seem to come right from Aliens & it rips off Star Wars (1979) with a tacky waste compactor scene. The characters are no better and you will probably not give anything wrong to any of them. While the other Critter films could be described as comedy watchers, Part 4 cannot, it seems to be fatally serious throughout. Critters 4 are also incredibly slow, cumbersome and boring. It is over 30 minutes before the Critter eggs are closed and after this short sequence it is almost the hour marked before being seen again, why make a Critter movie and hardly have them? It can't be because of the expensive special effects since they look like glove dolls anyway, oh, how can a mere hours old Critter drive a whole space station and set a course for Earth? How do they even know what the earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the podium anyway? What is all about the female scientist and a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once? Why does the Intergalactic Council want the critics so bad? Why only send four men? Why is this perfectly great station station completely deserted? Critters 4 looks cheap with gentle, dark imaginative sets and even steals recordings from Android (1983) because it is ships and space scenes, Critters 4 was apparently so low budget that filmmakers could not afford any optical effects and those taking off Android looks seriously dated out. For the most part, only two critics are used, although more people start to weed, but it is quite late in the day when it happens, for most movies they are hardly seen, and the effects for them are the worst of the whole series. Forget about blood or gore as the critics only kill two people during the 90 plus minute run, which just wasn't enough to keep my waining interest. The action is also pretty bad with Angela Bassett's over-the-top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few Critter eggs especially cringe worthy. To look at Critters 4 it is just as cheap and unspectacular a production that you could hope for (not) see. The end of Critters 4 has ultimately saved the universe as Critter threat, let's hope it also saves us and our local video stores from the threat in part 5 ...
