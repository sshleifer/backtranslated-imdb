Carrot Tops "Chairman" and his AT & T commercials are living proof that blown fecal matter is available in orange color. NOT AVAILABLE, however, as HBO charges for such waste. Blehhh! COTB's saving grace is that it surely fills suicide hotlines across the country, possibly providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs as recovered memory management was discredited, though (unfortunately) Carrot Top is likely to contribute to its sponsor AT & T's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from broken HBO viewers. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized television viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto, on the other hand, ringing out of last minute's desperation before they go off the shelf to escape the ghost of COTB's orange-haired monster echo in their synapses such as pain of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.
