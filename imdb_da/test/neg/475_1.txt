I just watched this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (I'm working for an independent theater chain in Colorado - that's one of the benefits) ... Sorry, but this is one of the WORST movies I ever have have ever seen! I know there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who (like Star Wars die-hards) will stretch you from the nearest tree if you dare talk something bad about their beloved movie icon ... anyway, Campbell's work from The Chin is a celluloid black hole. <br /> <br /> Before you make any assumptions that I'm a hoity-two movie film that only sees "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways", think again - I'm a big fan of B movies, and especially Bruce Campbell. His trademark character Ash is one of my favorites, and his depiction of the aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. But hi, B movies still have the potential to be reeeeally reeeeally asked (and not in the "good" campy way we all love) ... and that was what looked at this one , as for me and my colleagues. With the exception of the one jumper where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there was no laugh. Overall, we found the story to be mind-numbingly stoopid, pacing mollasses-like, and the so-called humor stupid than a bag hammer. (Sorry, but Ted Raimi's "Pavel" character was not comical relief ... he was just retarded!) Believe me, we all went into this that really liked it, but felt very disappointed and robbed by two hours . <br /> <br /> If you absolutely loved this movie, plan to see it several times, want to marry children with it, etc., it's great - we all like what we like so you get no judgment from me. But do not question the sense of humor or the fan loyalty of those who have no more orgasms over Campbell's latest cinematic coupe. This flick was a steamy turd sandwich in my humble opinion ... and as a true Campbell fan, I'm allowed to say it!
