This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The 1983 rural areas where you have not been in high school junior (or senior? - they seemed to flip flop on one) with weird hair and "Leo-like" good looks have a big plate full of trouble. His place father announces certain plans to have a sex change operation that his mother calls marriage. Sebastian is called the "f" word by everyone and their mother, constantly "kissing around" with different girls, getting high on Ready-Whip at a supermarket and saving a "strawberry" prostitute from her ruthless clusters of pimp. <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "friends" make Eddie Haskal a cross boy; Bad association doesn't get much worse. Sebastian seems to go after "Harold's" suicide attempt record (though he won't admit suicide). No apparent reason why the genius level SAT score Sebastian should educate a year early even though he has no clue about the future and he also does not want to go to college (what does this nonsense mean?). <br /> <br /> This movie is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone beautifully abandoned. The final scene suggests that things will be okay, even though the HOWEN is back to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The authors of this movie seem to be beating exclusively on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male leader. "History" leaves much to be desired. Looking for "what will this beautiful child do next ...?" does not exactly meet. The noisy production values ​​do not measure up to other films, independent or otherwise. A low budget and a weak history need more than a beautiful face to implement it. The result of this project is forgettable and an insult to intelligent biographies.
