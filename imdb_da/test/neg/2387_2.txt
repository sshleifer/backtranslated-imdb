If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, BEWARE !! The cover has Tori Wells and three other "80s" porn stars and has copyright in 1986. If you are like me (and I hope you don't), you think of "80s porn? Tori Wells? Okay!" Scams !! It was created in 1974 and has baptized German stars! There is nothing inherently wrong with the 70's German porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's not something the cover makes you believe you get it. When I passed my anger over the blatantly deceptive jacket, I saw it anyway. It's a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I really didn't expect to get past the rage.
