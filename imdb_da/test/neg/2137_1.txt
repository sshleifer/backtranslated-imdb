boring, horrible piece of italian euro waste about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer (that's what makes him american, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds all the really big theories come from) who studies something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange sound through his headphones and shows that his radio picks up a station in Jamaica. At the same time, a Jack Skellington girl with one of the worst, most faded moods of bad 80's, as it has ever been my pleasure to testify, is to try to soothe the dolphins at Seaquarium she is working on, as they seem to be concerned about The amount of fish she's been out lately. The beginning of the movie was a really badly colored story of two annoying, very Italian people whose boat was attacked by something unseen under the water. The whiny woman is never seen again (the best part of the story), and the boys' bodies are without legs. The weak alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and the stick-girl with hairs begins to theorize that there is some sort of giant monster lurking under the seas off the Italian coast. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They use an electrician to help create an underwater mike so the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend whose only drawback is that she says Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason he is sexually drawn on the anatomical skeleton with frizzly hair, a situation that leaves a flashing one. <br /> <br /> The headline is horrible, the editor a spaz and the story generally a yawning. There is little about how this weird scientific business genetically manipulated this monster giant shark-squid-barracuda thing for some reason that doesn't make sense, and a really unpleasant oily hard guy walks around killing women again, with no apparent reason . A stupid sheriff and his collected deputy are together on the trip with a female researcher (who we know is smart because she has big glasses). At one point, the woman's scientist takes the huge, horrible monster (yes, Ed Wood's giant squid was more credible) with only a small handle and she wins the competition. Hooray for thin little women who of course make the best monster hunters! The solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the Everglades and leave a dead zone for several miles in all directions. To hell with ecology and environment, right? We must kill this giant monster! At the end, the electrician and his diet pose love the sunset on her Vespa, which is like me. since she has died of her colleagues' death, and he is not very worried that his girlfriend was smashed by the crazy guy with the greasy hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a moment, there is no fishing for all this ...
