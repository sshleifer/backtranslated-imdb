Honestly, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen Spider Baby and not this land. Heck I have even seen 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and being surprised by the acting ability of Linda Cardellini I checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try. This is the last time I will ever trust a review on IMDb. I didn't realize that MORONS wrote IMDb reviews while waiting for their calls to be answered on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This movie is so far beyond bad that just words can't express the misery of its cast. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel really is really fun if you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Watch this movie, but DON'T BREAD!
