The reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a Bible? Everything in the film was about mashing, that God was out of it. It didn't happen by chance! God instructed everything he told them where to go and what to do. The people also walked for 40 years after they arrived in Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't walk for 40 years and suddenly found it. It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the movie actually downloaded a Bible first, they would say oh no, we got it wrong, try again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a messenger who constantly messed with Moses. No no no no no !!!!!! God was theirs all the time, and he wanted the people to see that he was taking care of them. How dare they say not even close to the passage. AND Moses was held out because he was angry with the people and was openly against God! He sinned badly and was told that he would not be allowed to do so. When did mashes go and cry to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! In fact, reading your story before you make up what you think is a good idea. Also this whole God got out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true !!! God did everything for the people, He provided for them in every way, and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. All we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways, but it is not how it worked! Yes today he does not work directly for everyone to see, but then he actually killed people after the golden calfing! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible Next Time Echo Bridge or Don't Make Another Bible Movie!
