Why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self-conscious movie? Beginning with an hour of needy plot and amateur business, we are starting to get bits and pieces of bigband swing that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, individually and together the great musicians they were. Occasionally - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra doing "Marie" and a standout, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestral fronting Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell sing "Green Eyes" - we get a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD transfer is just as bad as the actor. My copy has only four chapter stops. That means you can get arthritis in your forward finger trying to speed up where the good things are. The swamp you move through is Hollywood's version of the two Dorsey's lives and battles. Tommy, great on trombone, and Jimmy, great on saxophone, couldn't normally stand each other. In 1935 they finally split, with Tommy starting his own orchestra. Each one had more success alone than they had achieved together. They reconciled when their father died in the 40s, which is where the movie ends. They later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by Tommy, as the big band's era broke out in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at age 51, vomiting in sleep after splashes, pills and a big meal. Jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957. Jimmy was hugely talented and from all accounts, a reasonably light guy. Tommy was extremely talented and from all accounts, often an overbearing jerk. But good music makes a lot of mistakes, and Big Band sounds the two created helped define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the movie, and we see them evolving from juggling thickens (with kids actors) to adult men who are fighting and jamming each other. The movie is lumbered with not only their two parents played by the Hollywood Irish cliches, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who just want their boys to come together, but also with a great sub-story involving a romance between Janet Blair, as a childhood friend of Dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as almost a proxy mediator and enabler, and William Lundigan, as a piano player. Blair is not bad at all. But if you want to see why she never became the star, she should probably have been, just look at the movies, like this one, her study put her in. No wonder she left Hollywood. Lundigan takes only space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, except when we can actually hear Dorseys play? Well, here's a song written specifically for the movie and given to Blair for warble. It's called "to me". <br /> <br /> For me ... are you rosary rose ... the rise of a rising sea ... a star's glow ... <br /> <br /> The rose of a rosary? The movie doesn't get any better than this, and it can't get any worse. Still if you like Dorseys and if the price is right ... yes, afterwards I still won't buy it. The highlight for me is Eberle and O'Connell, who sing "green eyes". You can watch them on You Tube for free. You will also find a lot of each of Dorseys. I wish I had known.
