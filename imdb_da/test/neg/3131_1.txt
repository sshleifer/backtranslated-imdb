This could have been an excellent girl. But as many other people think I do. It is badly done because of the language transfer. If the whole movie is to be read, it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else. It has an excellent rating as far as I'm concerned and I couldn't wait to rent it. But when I did, it was a real let down. Outside here in Boardman, Ohio I couldn't find an English version for something like that. This movie was also compared to Dark Hours, and we will not see that in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. So I think we never know how good the movie was.
