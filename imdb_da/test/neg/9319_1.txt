Now I remember when the studio beat Schrader and hired Harlin to make reshoots for this movie, they were right. Dominion: Prequel for the exorcist is simply a bad movie, it is boring, It would be nice to believe that the studio set aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who so much condemned Harlin's version and praised Schraders even though no one ever had seen it would have been right. <br /> <br /> But they were not. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be and it turns out a great way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentional fun in all the wrong places and badly supporting casts. <br /> <br /> Save your money and your nerves, don't see it.
