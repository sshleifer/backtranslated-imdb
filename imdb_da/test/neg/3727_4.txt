OK if I was in the rental shop and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks to rent, I should say no. The reason was impossible. I have come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves cannot act. He can at times be painful to see (though my wife thinks he's cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually big) was even a bit disappointing as the crooked cop. On the plus side, the plot (because it is removed) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
