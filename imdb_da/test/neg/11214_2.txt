This review includes a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The movie is an American ninja that is mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls to the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated shallow post to the "People's hero" at the end of the movie. This film is extremely cheesy and very poorly studied. It's good for people who don't care about the development of land or reality. Good for children under 14 years. The military flaws in this movie are comical. I remember during my three years in the military that our private was not obliged to greet or call the NCO's "Sir", the film does it in various places. The Colonel's hair is too long on the ears. Master Sergeant's mustache was against military protocol in the long run. At the post, the Colonel was the only officer around. No other officer was shown around the post. You had idiot ninja brandshing swords against troops with m-16s, a little badly made. <br /> <br /> The people this filmed reeked. Michael Dudikoff is not really that bad for an actor, he just has miserable scripts. The nuns were more fun than dangerous. Avoid this movie
