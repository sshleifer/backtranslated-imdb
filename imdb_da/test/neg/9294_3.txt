A very sensitive subject - 15 year old girl abandoned by mother as a baby and going to visit her, continues to be ignored, being raped by her mother's boyfriend, getting pregnant. There was not enough depth to this situation. Too much time has been taken up with the trucks that transport the child. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma - you never see him crying - except once - is being fed, has been changed throughout the trucking test.) I would have liked to see more of the connections, more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor - this should have stood up for court immediately. <br /> <br /> And it was a true story! It deserved a better story than that! <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the subject, I'd have given it closer to a 0 rating. I rented this from the library. Only later did I find out that it was made for television movies. <br /> <br /> Oh yes
