This film is essentially a "how-to" way of being a well-connected pedophile. I am amazed that so many people - especially other gay men - have seen this movie and read the book, and no one has discovered that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in prison, take time for child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (but incredibly beautiful) teenager who he found on a high school wrestlers training camp in the Midwest, brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic images of him, many of them fully frontal nudes, all through Johnson's teenage years. It's not art. It's child abuse. And what's worse, Weber made lots of money out of it, and poor Johnson will have serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's gloomy love for the boy is even scary, like his ramblings of famous (and not so famous) people he is known to try to accomplish Johnson's "education". Creepy, and just boring. The only redeeming thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can only wonder why no one ever considered the effect this had on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson) himself.
