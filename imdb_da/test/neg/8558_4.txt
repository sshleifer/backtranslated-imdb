LORD PROTECTOR is a pram, but for whose children? Obviously shot to television or STV, this amateur rehash CROWL has several stock characters - a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist - on the trail of something or other to defeat the dark forces of being released on their planet. Badly written, acted and staged in accessible California places like municipal parks and a ranch, LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time player. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended target age group of five, will probably not remember him from such an old Disney ticket that DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE. A no-name actor who plays a magician in a creepy silver wig plays at least what the tongue planted in the cheek while those around him seem to be in a dinner theater production by KING LEAR. At least I was hoping for a decent action or special effects sequence. Unfortunately, the action sequences are pathetically tuned, and the few special effects are the old-fashioned painted-over comic strips we used to see in the 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, such as Bert Gordon's MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers planned a sequel that never came mercifully. Often, such cheap Hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. I kept myself inhabited during the movie's seemingly endless running time, trying to figure out which one was in this one. I did not succeed.
