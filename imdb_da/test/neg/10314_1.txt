The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie by the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this movie) is basically the cover text ... and the back cover art ... and the inner cover art ... the same picture. Her name is prominently displayed on the front, all 4 edges and the disc itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed inside the case. This movie should be about her character, right? WRONG! It's her first movie, and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role looks like a minor role. The character dog actually shows a personality. Less than an hour after seeing it, I don't even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I saw it several times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I don't think it would be worth doing. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I just remembered a funny bite! Shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of "Doom-cam". Looks like a first person shooter game. Hands and guns point out in front of the camera. I'm not generally a person who criticizes movies, but it can be the worst movie I've ever seen. I waited for some silhouettes to cross the screen, sit down and start making fun. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad the money we spent on this (spent) went to charity.
