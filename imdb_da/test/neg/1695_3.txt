Maybe it woke them up in the fifties, but that's one of the flicks that doesn't go well. It has the preaching, serious, dimmed workman vibe of a 2nd movement Rod Serling live TV "Playhouse" broadcast. The "plot" is by the book, the uneasy background of the Cassevete character seems dressed, and the love interest is convincing and half-hearted. Sidney Portier gives an OK performance, but he was sure an annoying, haughty snot. If I were to work with this guy in a store, I would probably also like to hit him with a hug. Jack Warden is good because, as usual, he plays Jack Warden. As 90% of the films judged on IMDb (whether classics, mediocre, or crapola), it is somehow rated 7 points - some stars. It is by no means worth it. Save your time
