A girl named Isobel is obsessed with a demon. The local priest (who was previously dated Isobel's sister) should try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Ethan Wiley, the author of "House" and the author / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and liked the other one even better so you would think it would be a winner. Unfortunately, it seems that it was thrown together by first-year film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I have been thinking of accusing the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is almost non-original (trying to cash in on fans of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose"?) But Wiley should have been able to do her magic. br /> You also want to think about veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (playing the bishop) hardly shows up, and Combs has a big role as a sheriff ... in the five minutes he's on the screen (but I love cross-hatching). So no help here. <br /> <br /> After viewing "The Exorcist", all other exorcism movies must be compared to the classic by default, no? And the demonic possession in this movie was not scary at least. No head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. Just a girl with a deep voice and continuous makeup. All the "demonic" things were centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "You get a lot of Isobel jumping on her bed, as if it's a trampoline hiding in his closet and jumping off a hay loft. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese that's gone game. " Unfortunately, it is a summary of the scale of the evil in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who make accusations and shout at each other while the obsessed daughter is in another room camera, this is the movie for you. But if you don't mind saying that, you have a terrible taste in movies, if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The reason seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who is not, but sleeping with his daughter) and the vet to sleep with his wife (who may or may not, but deny it). And then you have a gardener who attacks the obsessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but when the priest arrives at the gardener, he does not believe in God. What was the whole Bible - quoted you doing five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A horrible exorcism movie. Horribels examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad view of the director after the "House" series of movies became classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley was not involved in making this shamefully derived and unoriginal, uninspired movie. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this movie as if it were a cardinal sin if you looked at it.
