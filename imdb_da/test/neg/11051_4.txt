By Jove, what a creepy mess! Vengeance, incestuous laws, mechanical games such as fighting, incessant and completely unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering away in the confused victims, great "surprises" (which actually tend to be "revelatory" as The National Enquirer's headlines) . Adding some shoddy camera movements pretends to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie is undeservedly popular, showing strongly that the very low level pop subculture has succeeded not only in achieving the last decades but also in introducing as a dominant flavor to an impotent audience. (Too much deeper insight into human suffering during mental illness, without "Oldboy "'s vulgar surplus, I recommend an older Dutch / French movie," The Vanishing ".) <br /> <br /> Well, don't believe there is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. In fact, there is. The (famous) scene where the hero (is really a "hero", an abbot father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to gain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) Eats a live squid advantage much of the living presence of the best actor throughout cast: squid itself. The honor that the poor animal, after being eaten, could not survive its only action to obtain yet another worthless diploma for the "best actor" at the Cannes Festival. <br /> <br /> Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless, if any exotic wonder, became a festival of vapid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sic transit gloria mundi!
