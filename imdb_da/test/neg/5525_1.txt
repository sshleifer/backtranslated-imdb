This is so poor, it can be seen. <br /> <br /> The reason is about a grizzled spacecraft crew member taking place on a driving, seemingly abandoned Russian craft. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the two craftsmanship collides (!) in the empty space - and 'Alien' esque fun as a Russian ship's cyborg threatens our crew. The interior of the spacecraft is clearly a dolled-up factory set (metal walkways, boilers, pipelines). In this completely inconsistent setting, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our entire staff hugs grimacing, shallow and continuous and repeatedly racking their shotguns without shooting them. <br /> <br /> Continuity guns are what define this movie and they are nothing short of amazing: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The guns are racked. A cigar gets longer by being smoked. The rifles are racked again just to secure themselves. The contents of a bottle increase by being full. <br /> <br /> The movie progresses through the usual clich√©s using intense ham, poxy camera work and Ed Wood quality props for a showdown climax.
