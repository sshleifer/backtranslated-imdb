This is the result of the city of Milpitas California, which makes a home video and exposes the rest of the world to it. Legendary in some circles as the greatest cinematic turkey, this movie is rightly considered a bad movie. Share comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non-actors not acting. The reason has something to do with a giant monster created by waste and pollution in the area and going on a rampage. The monster, which we don't see until the last 20 minutes, is pretty cool, but it's not cool enough to justify looking at the previous hour's boredom. Quite honestly hardened bad movie lovers will have a hard time getting through to the end. This is a stinker.
