As the main "character" Lillith Silver likes to point out - "you know f ** k all about vampires". It is clear that this statement was aimed at the cast and the crew, which creates a very bad image of everyone's favorite blood-red cape. According to the deceived director, all vampires are dressed in white foundation and stuffed in latex, like a piece of meat in shrink paper. With prisoners reminiscent of Bannana and a bad case of asthma, our main character Lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the "modern" vampire. The plot consists of a 9-year-old boy's playstation collection, which is laid out on a piece of paper, then mixed together to collide this horrible tale. Lillith our pale protagonist is a Vampire Bounty hunter who lives on stumbling members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! Instead of incorporating the classical murder methodology of precision and precision, Lillith melts in through an open window and continues to throw her target necks before shooting them pointing blank with a gun (which apparently doesn't leave bullet holes thanks to the creepy continuity). PC Plod is then assigned to solve the murders, he comes to the grizzly, yet strikingly obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually a vampire and continues to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire shipping tools, including a cross, garlic and a sharpened piece tree . Meanwhile, Lillith, who is used to bending his boss, is confused when an old nemese kidnaps him and requires a ransom to be delivered personally. As you may imagine, it does not conform to the plan. However, I will not put myself through the pain in the following scenes, so I will jump to the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith has won, it is revealed, with all the extravagance that someone is told they have cancer, the two are century-old lovers, and the whole plot was a kind of twisted game. Yes, the kick in the balls was the actual end of the movie. In my eyes, this joke of a conclusion is glaze on latex-dressed cake and seals this film in "Never see this" vault. <br /> <br /> As far as movie techniques are concerned, the movie just does not interfere with creating any style. The director tries to save his catastrophe from the brink by throwing in some close-ups and a couple of multi-edged shots, but it's not the scanty grace that the movie needs. <br /> <br /> You may have to scream "but this is a B movie, it's supposed to be crap!". However, I do not pity. I have seen some bursting B movies, like Evil Death 2, and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and therefore this shame cannot hide behind excuses. The budget was low, this is evident from the lack of location and good actors. Perhaps, but if the director was more creative and spent less on paying for makeup and false blood, he could have done something decent with this pathogenic trial. The seedy sex scenes are not beneficial in any way, and only served to give me a few chuckles on the indecent acting skills throughout. Half of the budget must have been paid to the female caste alone to get their tops off lesbian romps. If I wanted to see a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse, and the effects are amazingly fake. This film had some potential, but its seedy undertone and embarrassing depiction of a classic scarecrow only served its downfall. <br /> <br /> If you want a laugh with a few friends, I recommend seeing this mockery. If you are looking for a more serious vampire action, try Blade or Underworld to prevent your raging bloodlust.
