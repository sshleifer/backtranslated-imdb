Unless there is a huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw fell as I read the positive reviews of this movie; I can't believe this movie was even released, it's so bad. I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to see it objectively anyway, you know it so badly, it's funny, and was still offended by its sheer horror. The play is horrible, they can't have seen rushes and I guess there was a take per scene, it's really that awful. It's the worst movie I've seen for many years, in fact I wouldn't even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay friend who no one actually calls "gay" is just implied because he's so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, it is actually actually developing. The witnesses die on their pathetic asses, the music is so bad that it can withstand faith. The person who composed the soundtrack chose, in essence, the most ear-mutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put into this wasteland. Oh my good Christ, I can't believe that the 80s produced complete waste like this, I grew up through them, and I can't find a thing worth noting here, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema. /> <br /> If you are even considering watching this movie, going to see a psychiatrist, then he'll break you down, you're sick, sick person.
