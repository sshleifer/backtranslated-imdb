I was unlucky enough to watch this movie at a friend's house. What a complete waste of time. What a complete and complete piece of crap this movie is! Absolutely nothing is fun in it, from the shower scene to the Germans' abusive and degrading depiction. There is no plot, the play made me gag and in the end I personally wanted to beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought John Woo movie was bad ..... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
