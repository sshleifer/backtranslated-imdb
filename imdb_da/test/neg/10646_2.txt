In the XXII century, an architect named Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) commands a space station which he personally designed. As can be predicted, a special force is sent to resume the expensive station and put the seller in custody. Upon arrival, they find him participating in a strange ritual using a mysterious cubic. In interrogation, he reveals that they must let him finish what he has started or else in hell that he has released will bathe in blood ... To convince the officers who hold him in captivity, he reminds him of his inheritance , about the toymaker, who built the box and about the reasons why he is here in space ... The movie, which is pretty much the same for Hellraiser, that The Quickening was to Highlander. Something to be ignored and forgotten, as such, will not affect Hellraiser too much. By far the most fragile of the franchise with a much lower degree of sense of it than its predecessors (which let's see it was B or C class film). <br/> <br /> Sometimes it seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn-flick with wood incredible performances that actually think: So when should they dress and start intercourse? Surprisingly not much sex in the film, although the introduction of the seducer-demon Angelique (a completely superfluous character that unnecessarily crushes with what we know of the Hellraiser world) provides ample opportunities for the love-making. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie consists of three suddenly separated stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that lack focus and are rushed together amateurishly. The end result is extremely poor, basically emphasized by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to any of the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some decent gore in the girl, but apart from that is a complete failure.
