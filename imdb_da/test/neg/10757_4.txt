Without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole matter degenerates from about five minutes before the end. If the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth seven. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a woman was added to the cast. (Well - not really!) The prerequisite is good. The situation in which the victims are in is quite scary, and it is quite well done, but you get the impression, the film makers lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said, they switched authors and handed over to another.
