This movie is so God-horrible that it was literally a task to see. I wanted to push it out of my room and throw it over the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually be fun and everything would be okay. "You lose, we win, yay!" This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even entertained the idea that Jackie Mason was fun. Then turn them over the head with this film until the tape cracks. And if you are considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) I have one thing to ask about you: Don't even look at the cover? I mean, with rubbish like this you can tell with a glance how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This movie sucked.
