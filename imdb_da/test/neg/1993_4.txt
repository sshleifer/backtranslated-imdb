It's okay ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his true cinematic BIG home run ... but for now this dark comedy isn't the classic one it strives to be. It's mostly awful, even though it has some good scenes: The first murder victim has been found, the ER clerk is responsible for billing patients who make a surprise discovery, Drummond's error and the last scene where Scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-respect. . It also has some ridiculous scenes: Scott's character is whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital's psychiatrist, Scott's character's rap's character, Dysart's terrible tremor in his short scenes and O.R. doctor pouncing on the operating table to revive the wrong patient because "I already have a malpractice trial". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky is also trying too hard to throw any conceivable obstacle in this one hospital (ie, the murders, administrative bugs, poor people protesting outside, etc.). It might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. Action-wise: Scott is acceptable, Rigg seems miscast, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart mug through his brief achievements. The rest of the molding is TOO one-dimensional.
