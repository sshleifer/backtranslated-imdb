I really wanted to like this movie for every possible reason - the subject is intrinsically interesting and is probably the biggest problem in the world today and has built fascinating works (eg Linda Grants when I lived in modern times), usually from Israeli side of the fence. Also, a block I like told me he thought it was the best movie he had seen all year, so with such a recommendation ... but I actually found myself nodding on points! Admittedly, I was tired, and the movie theaters were comfortable, but I found it to be very hard work trying to identify with the characters. When I got my head around the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with it, but it made it disappointing as a sketch show rather than a movie. I liked the concept of a persistent, almost silent mise a scene as opposed to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja Muslim fighter. But I personally think the movie has been overheated. I'm not saying narrative and plot is everything (it's certainly not), but even a bit more dialogue would have helped.
