Being a great fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/) I was expecting to be wowed by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. Same director, same actress - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plan is a huge disappointment. It is very slow and talkative, which would be fine if the dialogue conveyed insight into the characters, was meaningful or original. But it comes across as a typical soap opera that shifts between irrelevant pillow talk and jealousy accusations. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a little bit of character development or at least "character change" for Pauline. The source material is standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation), but it could have been a decent movie anyway, if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Event, though there are other shortcomings with the Rohmer season cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues over this one.
