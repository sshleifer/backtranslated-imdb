I liked some of the characters, but our joints were very much dependent on a charming smile. I didn't care about two whits about him. He made bad choices and I didn't care when he didn't think either. He seemed pretty incomprehensible. There were a few moments that gave a chance for some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but they are lost in the overall disadvantage of the film. The love interest was acceptable, and the other different characters were mildly interesting, but the plot waved too much and left me on many points in the movie. In the end I wondered why I was so long. <br /> <br /> There are some humorous moments, but in the end I don't care. I can't understand the movie higher. - 3 out of 10
