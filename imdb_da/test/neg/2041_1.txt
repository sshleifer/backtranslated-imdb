WOW! What a horrible, horrible waste of time showed this celluloid cruelty. I remember seeing it many years ago and thought it was fun, but now ... it's simply stupid. Not to mention the fact that it is a blatantly rip-off of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was reissued at a time under the title "The Sex-Orcist". The only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by striking the claim that the events in the movie are genuine! Who in their right mind would actually believe in such a boldly confronted lie? To make matters worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to deposit on the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a few lips on the cover! How low can one possibly sink? Don't be fooled by the false claims, obvious lies or title rip-off because you will be SORELY disappointed if you do!
