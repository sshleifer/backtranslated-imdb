Judging a movie just for landscapes, decor, costumes .... it's just not right you lack the core: History <br /> <br /> A movie should tell something to tell a story something that impresses you. Yes, I was fond of the sea, the rocks, clear water and all that, but ... That is the plot? <br /> <br /> They are more interesting movies with crazy people, like: FLY OVER CUCKOO "S NEST ... etc ... etc. This is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband. Just a clear psychiatric case! Nothing extraordinary. Unfortunately a waste of time .That is all this rage comes from "fish smell" sea?
