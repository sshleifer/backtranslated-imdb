I'm a big fan of the "Vacation" franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie, and at least a couple of back-stage names were involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons, who produced or performed all 4 of the theatrical publications, as well as "Animal House"). For the reasons I expected, this broadcast might be worth checking out even without the Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect the plate to be very good; I just thought it could be a little entertaining diversion. Therefore, my high level of disappointment goes to prove how bad this great turd of a movie really was. It was insane, stubborn, heart-stopping, head-exploding, horrible. But somehow I couldn't stop seeing it. It's a disease I have; I can't seem to go on a movie or give up on a TV show until it ends. Nothing has ever made me, I want two hours in my life back more than this movie.
