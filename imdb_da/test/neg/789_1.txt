I like movies, but I found nothing to like about the box. I was interested in the plot's "hook", but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Anyone who says they understand this movie probably fails so they can feel they are part of something, well I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and destroy humanity. I've heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. It is true that this movie is different from many movies that are currently appearing in theaters, but it does not make it worth the ticket price.
