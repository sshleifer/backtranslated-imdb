I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER again making another "biblical" movie if Noah's Ark is to be the norm. Apart from the horrible, completely uninspired action of the entire casting (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly is the day it agreed to make this movie), the timeline is completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate battle on the sheet deck or the travel dealer who comes on his paddle boat. Hi? All others were dead except for Noah and his family according to the scripture. God stacked timber and added plans to build the ark when Noah asked how ?? I also can't remember reading anything about Noah's wife who constantly gnaws him over the 40 days, or Noah wandered around in glassy eyes and dazed all the time. The writer of course had little knowledge of the Genesis book, or just didn't care that his abomination of a story completely sucked it.
