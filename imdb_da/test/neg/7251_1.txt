Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. This was a movie I tried and hated. Mostly, after hearing so many people decry the burial of typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I saw signs of scandalous for "Eastenders" to be paraded as realistic. Clint wants out of the drug life and to do this, he strives to be a servant. The goal is high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a fax photo of him, or perhaps a curly wig on a stick, was hard to tell offer to hire Clint if he got a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint and a great entourage, apparently walking across England are trying to get him some shoes. Finally, they connect to a suburban home. If not clear Mom helps a girl shoot up Oh now there is some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha tie and found a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis tunes and shocks the kids away. Why has Clint not borrowed any money and bought shoes at a used store? Why didn't he go to a church and ask a friendly non for help? Why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? I just don't know! None of these things seemed to be under him. Blessed groups, like Goodwill and Salvation Army, have shops to help people. I know people working there! If someone with any money appeared and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but a form of footwear. Not many of these groups make mobile phones the underprivileged, but shoes are usually no problem. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, is simply not so cruel. In England, it may be from "The Queen's Royal Charity" instead of Goodwill, but people who need shoes get them. <br /> <br /> Apart from the search for shoes, there was no visible plot to get in the way of the action. Not that it made the movie any faster or more bearable, think of you. Although you checked the ribbon jacket several times, I didn't look at the 20-hour extended version, so it only seemed like that. <br /> <br /> Has Clint got her shoes? Did the card by Brad Dourif hire him in the restaurant? Have I ever seen another stranger ever again? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> As for the fate of this movie, I decided to finish it all. I took my S & W .45 out and shot half a hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental shop, and amazingly ever PLEASE CALLED TO ASK ABOUT IT !!! This of course means that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something I didn't do. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> BTW if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has actually put a ball through it, take it as a sign. And if you work at the Kroger video department, I just talk. <br /> <br /> Footnote: This classic has not yet seen the light of day on DVD, for which we should be forever grateful to the digital gods.
