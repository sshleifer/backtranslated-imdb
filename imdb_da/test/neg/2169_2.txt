While the writing was horrible, the actor was horrible, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the chest count, but it wasn't enough to make me see it again. All told and done, I'm actually stupid from watching this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman, who starts the film wearing a garbage bag and makes speed sounds, should have made me realize what I was getting into. This was by far one of the worst ever exposed by the Troma team. The best place to show this movie would be for the invalid, the sense that they can't come up to change the channel. Finally, it is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
