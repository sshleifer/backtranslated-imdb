I can't believe I actually created a 'season pass' on my TiVo for this, apparently they had a good example or something. I can't imagine it myself. After looking for about 5 minutes I thought of myself .. why do I look at this. It is certainly not reality, and some of the worst acts I've ever seen on television. I am a total addict of reality TV and there is nothing real about this. ACTING .. (if you can call it that) is terrible. The only ones who are almost 5% decent are the girls who are meant to draw viewers to the show. Although they would be much better off saving this train wreck .. if they wanted more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably didn't have any talent either. This is, of course, a very low budget production with 'actors' that seem to be very cheap. There is no way they could get a job in something else. Someone has to lead these people to a job in the food service. Maybe they could. Oh and by the way, Parco P.I. no longer takes up space on my TiVo or TiVo season card. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
