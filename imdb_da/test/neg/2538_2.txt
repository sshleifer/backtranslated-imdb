Anyone who wants to pay to watch Troma movies knows, and appreciates what to get. That said, I didn't think it was possible to make a movie, so bad, and still convincing. I found myself looking just to see how much worse it could come before the end. First and foremost, it is an Indonesian action movie featuring an American protagonist who looks and acts as a bastard son of "Taxi "'s Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He puts posters himself dressed up as Sly's "Cobra" everywhere and even has a custom-built blast area (with action-focused cuts of his biggest enemies) in Jakarta, even though he's in the CIA and just arrived days earlier. There are lots of actions involving gun play (no mouth-blinking on these M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles (breaking through walls), karate (where nobody makes physical contact) and even some sex (where all the actors is ugly). The most important plot of an epic like this must at least be reasonably likely, but not here. It involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel that seeks to find a "medical detector unit". Why should they need it? It's never revealed why not kill drug sniffing dogs? It makes no sense, but it is taken seriously. The actors must praise because they really seemed to think that this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to "act". Best line? "Now dance to your grave, you dirty whore!" Best scene? Rambo jumps on flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as he falls, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown into water. F ** king genius! If you can't appreciate waste, don't see it. If you can it is fantastic. One last thing, did I mention it was ruled by the three Punjabi brothers?
