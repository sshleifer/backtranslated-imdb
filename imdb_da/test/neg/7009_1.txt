I just throw in this review to show that I'm not crazy - I like a lot of Wynorski's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law is fast and very enjoyable - just to prove I'm 'I'm not blind , I should mention this with some Shannon Tweed "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something", they are miserable - I have nothing against extracted sex sequences, but Julie Strains breasts are so unnatural, you can't help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect, but I do not enjoy staring at them - and more members of this caste seem depressed or uninterested - "Erotic thriller" was the worst thing to ever budget and thank God that their day is more or less finished.
