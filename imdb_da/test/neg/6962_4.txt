I fed this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. I sat down to see it with this mindset and was pleasantly surprised. It is not good. It's not even that good; In fact, it's pretty poor. But it's not as bad as I had been led to believe by a long shot. It is rather inappropriate and obviously a cost-saving measure, many stockpiles are being pushed into use, many of which have no apparent relationship with the story. <br /> <br /> However, it is an intense personal film made by a man who apparently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you discounts _Glen or Glenda? - Out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. Me, I'd like to be able to draw, but all I'm trying to draw comes out as stick men. I would love to sing, but all I do scares little kids. Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he did not have what it takes to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring movie for the Puritan 50s, but exploitative or incoherent it seems at first glance.
