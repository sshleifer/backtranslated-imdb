... without anything to go away with. This movie starts with scenes in China with the finding of a newborn. Although this is not a new concept, I would not give up right there. Then there is a glimpse into adolescence. Husband's wife and biological child are tired of the father who has neglected them. While this did not seem culturally accurate and the film made no move to develop these characters or the purpose of the adopted father's devotion, I pressed on. <br /> <br /> Next we are in Malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low budget (fill out form: acting / camera work / lighting). <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away more of the plot because I assume that synopsis is accurate: The movie is meant to show how a Malibu girl (although compassionate and compassionate) interest in helping others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to China) is pampered and inappropriate, finds herself a healer and helps both body and spirit. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. Now I'm a tough critic, so maybe take one of them LAME and you're going to be in the field.
