Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, the part-time comic and funny guy plays a Latin American assassin named after an African scavenger prairie dog? I suppose all the good Spanish nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Navaja (leaf) etc. were not available ?? And why would some South American assassins be familiar with a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army? Last time I checked, the IRA did not seek to open a headquarters in South America. And why would some prison-hardened Irish terrorists look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? Perhaps I thought this movie would be a spoof of "The Crying Game" when Geres's character was introduced as the person to chase "The Jackal". What a bad casting! And why would the FBI hire deprived terrorists to track murder? It looks like a terrorist is going for mass destruction, and an assassin usually hits a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only one who has ever seen Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought this movie would be a remake of the very big movie "Day of The Jackal", but this movie is just a stupid version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both of these movies are really stupid, and part of the stupid thing is that we, as audiences, are forced to see Bruce Willis review his routines and we must say "Wow!" Isn't he smart? "PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better movie about murderers." The Jackal "is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who could get paid to stand around looking beautiful and pretending to be smart!" Jackal "is so bad that I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke, and Jean Clod Van Dumme make comedies like "other" hitmen or FBI. Needless to say, "Jackal" has shown FBI for twenty-five years, but As soon as Richard Gere comes to work, it is only a few days before "The Jackal" is captain! I assume that the positive message of this movie is: "Thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from killers." Overall, "Jackal "no redeeming qualities.
