Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC-clad, bad bitch Alexandra, Faust's faithful acolyte, a vicious entity trapped in hell. Determined to free his master, the vicious minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magic gem vital to her success; but while performing a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the stupid jumping enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, resulting in the loss of the pearl and the release of two diminutive troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark. /> <br /> Now, Alexandra will find a replacement gem that won't be easy: The only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of his ex-lover, police director Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis) who is investigating the store robbery and who knows only well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the clever crackling mid-dimensional half-tiny Lite and Dark have come into all sorts of problems as they try to find their way home. <br /> <br /> In Jim Wynorski's combed movie world, all women are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie, whether she is a police officer, an antique manager or a mental patient in an asylum? Is hot, hot, hot and not much, and this is the fact that makes this otherwise completely insurmountable piece of STV shit just about portable. <br /> <br /> But be warned, even though the presence of the half-necked quality crest makes it a little easier, there is still plenty of this movie to guarantee that it will be labeled as an ordeal: the action is wood and the dialogue is painful; the black humor (as the DVD script describes it) is about as much fun as a knee to the knocks, with the comical banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy; And the special effects are the purchase basement, which consists of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have been dated ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for the high bimbo quotient.
