Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, must be the hottest thing on two legs, EVER. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Like "Troy", this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it particularly offensive is that they actually developed a homosexual character so people could hate him, making him so dastardly and vicious as any sign in television or cinema history. This is sadly insulting when Hercules might have had a wife as it was the expectation of the old days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it is ironic that they should create a gay royal opponent character for this movie. No, not ironic. Evil. The creators of this travesty should hang their heads in shame.
