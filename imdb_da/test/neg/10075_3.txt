I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It did not disturb me that Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and I just hoped for a good monster movie. It was about "Dinosaurs eating people." However, it was disappointing even at that level. First, there were not enough people to eat, and while I kept it secret, how many people were eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no lack of variation in the dinosaur community, there were hardly "enough" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are. <br /> <br /> START SPOILERS) Then there were Pterodactyls. The numbers I read put their body weight at about 15 pounds while the film made them closer to 300. Worse, they didn't get to eat anyone, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them off high. There was no end to the movie, neither, it was just sudden credits. (END SPOILERS) I now wonder if the edition I saw lacked 40 minutes of film. My only conclusion may be that they taught Pterodactyls to keep their long beak smooth in your pockets and get your $ 7. at least you will not be disappointed.
