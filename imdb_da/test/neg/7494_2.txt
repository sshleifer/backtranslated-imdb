Perhaps it is unfair to dislike a movie, for what it is not, rather than what it is, but I was hoping that a film producer would finally make a movie about small towns with gay gay men. Instead, focus is primarily on the fierce bigotry (big news!) Of the locals (and those in remote areas) and the really horrible torture / murder of a young gay man. <br /> <br /> So much time devoted to stupid people who are crises about AIDS, sin, hellfire and perverts. So much time for the ghoulish preacher who ranted about the Bible and gay people get what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more of the people who came to the "small town gay bar", not those who opposed it. Moreover, the young man who was murdered is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie acts as a warning rather than a party and it is very suspicious.
