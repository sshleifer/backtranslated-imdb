Bad shot, poorly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, failed adaptation of a novel. It doesn't get much worse. Decent plays and good popcorn saved me for this one and a half hour - felt more like three hours - sorry. Occasionally good one-liners. <br /> <br /> David is a poor young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy of mumbo jumbo video, although it doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt collector band, with each member having an IQ below sea level. A missing script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, does what could have been quite fun cases of unsuccessful debt collection, look like an amateur homemade reality show. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment from a primary school teacher Haraldur, who, by dropping a few sentences about his own meaning, convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminals in Iceland. A seriously missing script does not offer David something to base his opinion on. A few scenes show that Harald would do something David could have interpreted would have done the work. The film's potential as a media, unlike the text in the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. <br /> <br /> Initially, David's affiliation with Haraldur raises his debt collector status, but the predominant paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The film is fine, but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better movie. A good scriptwriter could have made some of this material. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The action is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson does not have much to do with, but does his best with the small material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) manage okay. <br /> <br /> Overall Opinion: What could have been quite a fun and entertaining movie about a weak anti-hero in a debt collector band, becomes a dull, poorly crafted movie made after a bad manuscript. The star of the toes for an hour and a half would be more comfortable.
