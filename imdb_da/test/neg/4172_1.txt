It was apparently an award winning one. Apparently, someone had a gun against his / her heads and was able to nominate Maize: The Movie. <br /> <br /> Or it must have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the most incredible movie ever made. Screening and editing is the biggest horror in this movie. Two little girls are lost in a grain field and are stalked by a person who can be laughed at under his rubber mask. The little girls run into their hero-father and then run away from him, W.T.F. The hero's father in the movie keeps losing them within minutes to see it here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the girls were not educated actors and had no common sense to them. They were so annoying and so infantile in the movie, it's not even remote communicating. Hear them screaming again and again as a broken record was the reason why I came up and went. You can't even listen to this movie without almost going into convulsions. <br /> <br /> I can beat a better prize winner than this garbage.
