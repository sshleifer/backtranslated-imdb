Seriously, all these Satan come to Earth movies always involve the Catholics. Why does Lucifer never join the other churches? The plot is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but wasn't he always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with her child. Except maybe she is not his sister. The reason is not aware of this, and they split these scenes where he sees a shrink about his problem. <br /> <br /> The leading girl becomes pregnant while still virgin, with an incredibly crazy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact .... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by a washed and looks much worse for wear Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise be! <br /> <br /> Now, the demon child takes the mother's body for a joy trip and chooses to see a truck driver, his friend's boyfriend and his friend all by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the child when it is born. We find that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal that runs it all. <br /> <br /> The end is basically incomprehensible, and if you could do it so far, you have a stronger stomach than I did. (I stopped the movie a couple of times, it was so terrible.)
