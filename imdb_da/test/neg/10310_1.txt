Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn VHS, a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name have been written on the top. I just think they had the chance to sell the movie in the nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is just something to see in this movie, and her performance is the only thing you can call action. The rest of the film ?? It's fun to see in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but after that it gets worse. Much worse. Management is terrible. Acts are terrible. Script is terrible. Dialogue is terrible. The action is horrible. Music is pretty good indeed. Typical score for the 80s action movie. This movie is so bad that it is close to everything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It is so bad that there is no word properly to describe this bad attempt to be a movie. But there was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now get the movie out on DVD. It could be cool! And they have to write on the cover: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOCK IN HANGMEN <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
