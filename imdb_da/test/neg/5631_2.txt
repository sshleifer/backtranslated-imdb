STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Uortodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) flashes his time winding up the local constable and trying to romance a member of police officers. But everything changes when the host of the Thames side pub he frequent is found murdered, and a transcript of an unpublished novel announcing the legendary writer Charles Dickens exists. As he digs deeper into both mysteries, he further falls into mystery and danger than he commits to. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former football player Vinnie Jones shot nothing out and took everyone to surprise with his gangster cult classic lock, warehouse and two smoking barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by his acting ability, but his presence as a hard man looked to secure a decent career as a movie hard guy. But it all turned out to be a hit, and all that he really did after that, supported role status among much more recognized actors in films such as Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before coming down to the realm for DVD hell, the lately to be this confused and working thriller who may have been okay, he had not taken other renowned and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith with him. What made him fall from the dizzying success heights so quickly (except perhaps being a one-pony pony) is it any guess (a dodgy personal life is a possible guess), but here he is. <br /> <br /> A script so far fetched and incomprehensible as it would have been a task in everybody's hand, but with a miscast looking Jones at the forefront, it's even more a task to understand. Jacobi's equivalent roles as a former thesp tramp and Dickens himself speak directly to the camera through-out are of course hints to build up for something and the manuscript is predictable also in other areas. Add to these inexpensively great production values ​​through out and debut leader (also author) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What do I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *
