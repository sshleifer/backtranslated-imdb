It's a good time to say how well I think about this site: It allows me to revoke all the frustration I lived for two hours, waiting for something to be said to appear , being insinuated subtly, for a symbol, an idea, regardless. No, just long, endless violins, shifted by a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Drilling is the long dead of the mind, and this film is from the point of view a public enemy. How many thousands of living hours will still be stolen for thousands of innocent onlookers. I do not claim my money back just for my time and the time I invited people to look at this thing ... oh God!
