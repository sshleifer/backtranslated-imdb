I've heard a lot from this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia over the last three years. Apparently, on the thresholds, mutating to something highly contagious and millions of millions of people will be wiped out in a global pandemic. Just thought I'd mention this if you haven't got it to write your will yet. <br /> <br /> I also thought I'd mention it since I saw something called CARRIERS tonight that wasn't about naval warfare, but opens with a scene that is a cross between OUTBREAK and a episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago. I thought I would see something with added resonance after hearing the stories of the danger of bird flu, but after the non-unimpressive opening CARRIERS falls into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like any other TVM you see the protagonists are female, of which one is a ballsy authority figure, while the other lead woman is a toddler mother. Of course, it's also a fun sub-plot <br /> <br /> What's annoying about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what might have been a pretty good movie if it was made into a movie theater. There is a pretty gory scene of someone coughing blood over a nurse's face and a very impressive jay walker getting down stunt, but those bits are quickly forgotten as the mood falls into the family's feelings since this - and almost every other TVM ever made - was made for a largely female audience
