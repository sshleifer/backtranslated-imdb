I actually joined this site just to write about this movie. I sat in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-published public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was totally shocked to see that there was an overwhelming amount of people who thought it was amazing. I needed to have my word, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a task to sit through. The "Witnesses" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizoso's manic depiction of this unpleasant character should only appeal to the age of ten and below. It may actually be a stretch even for that age. I'm too slapstick ridicule, but there's not even the weakest hint of joke or wisdom. I have an idea, let's take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now it's fun. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies that you should watch, take stupid humor and add comics and originality: Marx Brothers' Night at the Opera, Monty Python's sensation of life, South Park: Bigger, longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. You must not lose one and a half of your life on creepy crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (the other author) did very little in film after this movie is because he was immediately blacklisted. I am actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover from this mess.
