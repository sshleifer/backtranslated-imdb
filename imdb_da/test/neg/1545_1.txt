The worst movie ever made, bore none. Give yourself a pat on the back if you may be able to sit through every terribly painful minute of it. Apart from the bit where the lucky lucky loser turned disturbed psychopath from forced medical experimentation, his pea soup pours on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should ... it's all.
