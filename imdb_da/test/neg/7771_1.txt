In 1970, the feminists invaded the "Miss World" beauty contest in London and ended the occasion by pelting the scene with flour and eggs. Why? Because they rightly or mistakenly felt that the event was degrading and degrading to women. I do not criticize their actions. It is a free world we live in. What I want to know is: why do their modern equivalents not invade the studios, where such and the like are done? <br /> <br /> 'Sex & The City' is about four self-proclaimed New York women: Carrie is a slave to fashion that turns into a pussycat when a man so much applauds her, Charlotte longs to find the perfect man (they do not exist, love) so that she can use sex to disappear the bad devil, lawyer Miranda scares the men away by twisting nonsense as 'out of touch with my feelings' and finally we have Samantha, living performance of the old Martini ad 'anytime, anywhere anywhere'. Feminists stop these characters - especially Samantha - as a shining example of today's femininity. Well, if you shout rude words in busy restaurants is progress, I think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what they should represent. <br /> <br /> Had 'Sex & The City' been the creation of a man, it would have been pulled from the airwaves to be sexist. Instead, as "Charlie's Angels" before, it has apparently preached intelligent women to believe that it has acted as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show. 'The Benny Hill Show' was also sexist, but at least it was fun.
