I caught this movie some years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. But since it was an action movie, I can't give it more stars since humor was unintentional. Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises leading Chuck to seek revenge for the rest of the movie. Well, too, 'the cuz subordinate who worked by everyone involved began to grow old very quickly. In fact, the judge was pretty good, but I can't really describe what makes him work. You have to check it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And the usual Chuck Norris drives are scary classic!
