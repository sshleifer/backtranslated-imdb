Neal N Nikki voted for this year's worst movie of Planet Bollywood. It's hard to believe the famous Chopra's has produced this miserable movie. It was presented as a movie to the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. It also does not make you laugh, but sad, and it does not have any sexy girls who make the movie look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever without acting. Having made many Super Flops and not received any films from a producer rather than his family. He gives a total crap performance that drills you to death. Tanisha, who is and will always be known for being the sister of Kajol, gives a terrible achievement. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age. It has a special look of the very sweet Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The end was so bold and stupid, I can't believe I actually paid the money to rent this crap.
