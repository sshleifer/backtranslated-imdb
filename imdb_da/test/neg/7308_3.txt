In fact, it happened: The royal father-in-law and father-in-law ate the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money publicly. This worried young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the question. We must remember that she was only 16. She was so embarrassed that she feared sex all her life. Perhaps this began to seem like a trauma. Also the constant interference of his aunt and mother-in-law. As you said, she kept all her children away from her, criticizing her teeth and manners (which she found inappropriate for an Empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter and mother died in law owed her for the unfortunate and premature death. She was never restored.
