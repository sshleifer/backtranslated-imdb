I'm in a movie class, and I know I don't know all about movies, but this is one of the worst, stupid, retarded and wasted movies I've ever seen, and I saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally awful. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the movie, it's not a heartwarming story and Pat Conroy overcomes nothing! I'm not saying that should fight and throw up, but it would experience this more than bland movie. the kids they want to act in this movie may have been the right children from yammacraux island, they sounded stupid and could not work as far as i was worried it was a stupid idea for a book and even worse idEa to a movie i don't know why this movie was made, divergent top five worst movies all the time.
