A 10-year-old boy met his parents argues to raise a car and go on a surrealistic journey across America to find the Motorama card, which is a petrol station card game, that if he can figure out "Motorama" a chance to win $ 500 million. He meets many bizarre characters along the way. No one can make an 'instant cult classic', Joe Minion's earlier "After Hours" achieved it with pure profit and a great instructor, but it wasn't instant. This film, on the other hand, is just bizarre, just to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of it. The reason is random at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos. It's just not a funny movie or a thought-provoking movie. It is also too merged. I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch movies. It's damn near heresy, for even Lynch's 'worst' movie (worst in quotes, since he doesn't have a bad movie really) is still miles over this drunk. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is Topless Very Short <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Trailer to "Joe Dirt"
