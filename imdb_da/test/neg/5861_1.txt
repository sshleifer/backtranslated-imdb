* Spoilers at the front, but it should not matter as I hope you will not see this one anyway. <br /> <br /> If you planned to see this, I strongly recommend you not. Because this was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours I've experienced. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete rip-off of the big movie "Battle Royale". It's as silly as watching a llama American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". The reason is completely predictable. One challenges pregnant and another is a nurse. Anyone who makes a logical thinking understands at first what should happen between them. The concept is torn down as mentioned before, and the film lacks the necessary violence to make this movie enjoyable. I think preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or even traces of the stroke in the back. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding any good, so take your money and get a copy of the Battle Royale instead of seeing this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, too bad I couldn't judge it lower. Almost make Scream 3 a masterpiece.
