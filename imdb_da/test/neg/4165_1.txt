I was initially thrilled with this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was constantly disappointed with the lack of depth and interest in the plot and subplots. Midway through the movie, I preached poker fun on the characters and set to avoid having to turn it off. I enjoy the premise of a future of merged cultures and separation of hare and do not have. What could have been an artificial and intelligent look to the future, morphed into a plodding, semantic sci-fi channel midnight flick with horrible actors, cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Perhaps he should stick to his socialist political ranting - it has all been downhill since Shawshank.
