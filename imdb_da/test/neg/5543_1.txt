Well they've made it a new pumpkin head movie, the first pumpkin head movie was perfect for its time, a stupid, gory and cliched monster girl. so heres how it goes, one loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the forest, causes her to raise the pumpkin head and make it murder all responsible. Unfortunately, the film authorities have found it irrelevant to try to do anything other than this, for the film's fourth outing, and consider it far more suited to adding some lame romeo and Juliet subplot involving an idiotic family celebration (over a car !!!!). and surprise surprise some gory pumpkin head slayings so far so formal, but it doesn't stop where the play talent in this flick is gloomy ... oh so bad half of them can't even hold up a southern accent without slipping into their original and often posher accents. Lance Henrikssen is on board, so he would probably get some gravitas for the film's work ... but no lance just ambler on the screen lets the words fall out of mouth with absolutely no feelings or apparent direction and go out again, I honestly think he just appeared up for the money, then went out to his trailer for drunk and reminiscent of foreigners. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete cack, there is no redemption feature except it ends credits that signal it all. <br /> <br /> despite the failure of ph: bf ... if you want a no brainer that makes you laugh for all the wrong reasons, see it. <br /> <br /> If you want something with abit more meat and originality avoid.
