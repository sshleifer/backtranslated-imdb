Well, I was hoping I had heard this movie wrong because I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and really didn't want to see him slip up; But unfortunately, this Giallo-style supernatural burden of nonsense is just as bad as I had to believe it would be - and it's pretty terrible! The reason doesn't work at all, as the film tries to mix murder and a supernatural theme through a phone and it all feels very forced and silly. Moreover, it is not much that makes sense, and you have to ask yourself "what is the point" many times throughout the film. The ground focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorized by a telephone. The best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the good points stop pretty much there. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are gory; but everyone is incredibly stupid, the one who sees someone killed by coins sticks out particularly in this respect. Overall, I really can't recommend this to anyone; Non-Deodato fans are unlikely to impress, and Deodato fans will likely find the movie depressing. Avoid!
