After seeing Shootfighter 1 and the blood boxes they throw, I was ready for another bursting jaunt with open-hearted massage and chiropractic in a cage. But no, it was like the Barney version of the first movie, with the lame from the Karate child. In any case, Bolo Yeung still kicks the booty, though he has to do more movies like Bloodsport and Caddyshack.
