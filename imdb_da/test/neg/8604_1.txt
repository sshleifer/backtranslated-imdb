I found myself watching Sex Lives Of The Potato men with a brow forehead, puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a movie so totally devoid of humor. Poo and wanking jokes are fun when you are eleven eighteen plus you start losing friends around the water cooler. Perhaps you could enjoy this movie if you are the kind of person who often plays handy jokes involving dog jewelry, brown bags and battles, or maybe participate in "man" competitions on evenings by asking companion / urine etc. ., when you are not back on your parent's basement and throw your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then "Sex Live ..." it's hard to recommend. Perhaps if you are really curious about masochistic cranial surgery and spending your evenings, happily relaxing the elderly or looking at toilets flush, you might think a bogie is close to cinematic distribution. <br /> <br /> I'd have been discussing characterization, narration or performances I hadn't zoned completely after the long tuna-paste / vagina comparison.
