Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Killing, imaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of movie that the Irish film industry shouldn't do. And with the added bonus of a treacle-coated finish. An eerie example of how talent and originality is brought to the benefit of an almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes - the kids are cute. Yes - it almost looks like it's done professionally. But this is film production by numbers, a direct smash and grip on what the director obviously thinks is 'success' - a film that protests and despises the audience. It's amazing that Working Title would pour Â£ 3m into this rubbish. But then they actually paid for love. Don't waste your money.
