I don't think it really matters too much what this movie is about, the most important thing you want to see is the extreme amateurity of the whole production. The action is what you would get if you randomly pick people out of the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a shot shot in your ear, while the dialogue may be a fifth as high. Various on-set sounds dominate the soundtrack to a great extent, with dialogue with a distant back seat. The theme music sounds like it was about a quarter done when the movie was released, as much of the movie has no music at all. Camera work can best be described as a shattered mess, with close-ups, where an intermediate angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every way, absolutely no attention by framing any scene, they just shot everything no matter what position it was most appropriate for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was a foot higher than the actors, and you end up looking at the top of everyone's head as well. Editing is just a butcher job; Everything is thrown together in the most abrupt way possible, no flows or transitions in any kind of word. I don't know if this was shot on video or maybe a hired video camera, I tend to think it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before I knocked it off, I was just as annoyed at the low quality of production that I couldn't take it anymore. It's like a ninth grade audiovisual class project.
