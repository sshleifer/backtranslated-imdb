It's a male bashing bonanza. I saw this on Sci-Fi some time ago, and the idea seemed interesting. It could have been a good movie, and I don't see the plot itself as male bashing, but some specific references to men become very annoying. I can still see the movie again, though at least it tries to resolve itself by suggesting that perhaps the women in the movie are not as violent as they claim, but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring man -bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after a while. Not only that, but supposing that the majority of women in the world would accept to become homosexuals so easily and that few backward heterosexuals would be such a minority to go "in the closet". It's just too incredible. There are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions who would bow to this, it is absolutely incredible. I think I know his sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint that it is possible and that is too impossible. The term "truth is alien to fiction" arose because fiction at least seems to be plausible to be welcomed, but the truth is not always. This movie is not. Apart from that, the film has some good plays and any morals of history that something like what happened was wrong, redeem it a little, but not enough.
