'' The Queen's Queen '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I have already seen. The only thing I like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything but that. (Since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington from Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how you start. So many stories were cut, as the twin's legend (one of my favorite) Armand and Dania's relationship and even Louis is not present to name a few. (The reason was dead) First, they should have made a movie of '' The Vampire Lestat '' because it is the second book after '' The interview with the vampire 'and not the' 'Queen of Condemned' '. They tried to squeeze in one movie so much information that you didn't get almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles. So many meaningful characters don't seem to have any real meaning in this movie. For example, it's Pandora's case. The actors they choose to play all the characters do not match many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, who is supposed to be a beautiful, tall, impressive blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from Lestat). I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's maker to Marius instead of Magnus. <br /> <br /> "The interview with the vampire was a great movie, I loved the actors and Tom Cruise, as Lestat was perfect and far better than Stuart Townsend. (I'm sorry that Tom Cruise dropped the chance to play Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras like Armand did not match Armand's appearance, yet, much better from this crap movie called 'The Queen of Damned'. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice was so fussy about Interview that I didn't get how she just sold the rights to this horrible production.
