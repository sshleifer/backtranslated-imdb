Is there a fire fighter clich√© NOT used in this movie? From the opening line "I'm getting too old for this" through firefighters' "antics", the "worrying wife", the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the last funeral of the fallen brothers, this movie looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department in Disney ("Our studies show that the audience really likes it when ..." and then they get stuck). There is nothing original here. Any feelings we feel for these guys have been brought in for our admiration and feelings for firefighters. <br /> <br /> Go see rescue me if you want to see real heroes: Everyday guys with bugs that don't seem to run into a burning building to save strangers.
