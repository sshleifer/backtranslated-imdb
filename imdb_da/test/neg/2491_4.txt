This movie is a final 5. I finally caught it on HBO the second night. I remember when it came out in theaters that tell a friend that it would never be a hit because the Americans did not want movies about the story, especially movies that were more about ideas than action. I do not know if that was why FMLB did not do well, but now I have finally seen that I can add a few observations myself. <br /> <br /> Only while Dwight Schultz has been fine in Star Trek and The A-Team, as the lead in this movie is he off-putting. I expect him to shout out Jon Lovitz-like, "I'm ACT-ING!" His wording and sound signal sounded like he was trying a lot to be an ACT-OR, at a stage where he had to emphasize strangely different words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I enjoy the sweet positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator who, at every turn, strives to occupy these cats (scientists) together to reach his goal. <br /> Third, there was a discussion about the moral implications of creating the A bomb and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough of this, or as in depth as justified. Finally, there seemed to be a terrible mass of phrases thrown in for dramatic effect. I don't know how much of the events in this movie are true in life, but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or have a lab accident caused by a spilled coffee cup (and a scientist killed as a result) were stretching the limits of credibility. Maybe there were things or things that were really random, but it sure felt that different scenes were added exclusively for dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to read more about the actual events knowing whether it was over the top or just mostly correct.
