Bank heist / Cop thriller sounds OK right? Chaos looks good: nicely framed, good production values, high concept action hoist ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> The reason has the unique achievement of being both smart and incredible , blatantly unlikely in "how we actually got the money" mode and overcomplicated in "who did it and why" section at the same time ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Ryan Philippe is NOT shouting, seriously NOT rather hard or scary ... and he is not particularly hard or scary when he throws a crazy fit. In fact, his big outbreak is the only really fun scene in the whole movie. Must make him excited that he knocks down Anakin Skywalker's role and does it now .... Stratham is usually good as the hard but silent hard nut with the self-humor, but here, the extra lines are so ridiculously bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the klich√©d mush required. More quietly seems best <br /> <br /> Snipes are actually OK in a typecast way, but another nail in a talented actor's coffin: he needs an actor role, not an action hero rehash. Perhaps the company with its treasures will allow him to break that mold, and the public and critics will let him vote for the sympathy. It would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time. <br /> <br /> The lines these guys speak when they don't do plot development and detective work can be summed up in a word ... .pheeeuuuh. <br /> <br /> The movie feels all out of whack and it never gels: I found it annoying for the first 45 minutes and the tighter last part was acceptable. It should / could have been good, but it just can't solve the terrible lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of annoyance with the levels of plausibility. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have almost never done it: incredibly annoying, and Ryan .... please, get rid of goldilocks ....
