So, after the first disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to be barred by no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself for a warm reception and now a dedicated fan base. And the reason for the movie's success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast-moving sequences and some cool as hell characters. But if you have not played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this movie as it is the story that takes place from the game without prior explanation and you will probably get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. Second, there is no sign development without prior knowledge of the game. Your opinions about the characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool". Of course for the movie FF7, the movie is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to see all the characters you grew to love from the game, which were reproduced in some pretty amazing computer animations. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, tried to slam too much in less than two hours, and therefore works the last half hour or so terribly rushed. If you played and enjoyed FF7 than it is a worthy watch, but nothing too special. If you haven't played FF7, it's best that you play it first before watching this movie.
