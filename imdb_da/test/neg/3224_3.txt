This movie may be if not for all languages ​​in it. I think the story itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or children watch the movie. I know the kids will learn all the difficult words in the end, it's true, but parents shouldn't help them in the process by letting them see and hear the things that are subject to entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used to like Robert Loggia; he has a distinctly greedy quality with the rough voice of his, but in the last few years I have only seen him who has roles with a lot of languages ​​in them. If we had a price for using the F-word, he should be a competitor. Unfortunately, I think he has now lost me as a fan. When I see his name on film in the future, I think twice about retrieving the title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not bragging. I sometimes also use languages ​​in extreme circumstances, but when we look at a movie, for the sake of E N T E R T A T I N M E N something we hope will bring some joy and escapism. I don't want to be reminded of what is happening in the street in any big city these days and it's hard to wonder if a movie is okay for my family to see. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it is a pity that he is affiliated with an image that has eased his image like this. He probably did a similar job in the movie, but I beat approx. 1/4 of the way through after getting my ears attacked once too often by others in the casting. Why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to continue with this boys language? When enough actors (especially the big names) have kicked it up, the authors will stop putting it in the movies! I'm sorry but I can't recommend this picture. It's also a shame because I think it would have been okay if it had been good enough for decent families to see! Thank goodness, I just wasted $ 2.00 on it!
