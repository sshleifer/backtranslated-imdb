Terrible! One of my friends (who of course thought I had an abysmal sense of humor) recommended this. <br /> <br /> It's coil. I almost switched it off. It is only my anal desire not to leave things unfinished that prevented me from doing so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a British attempt to make a movie with a crowd also drove television actors using some lame script from their buddy in the company. I struggle to think of something that even approaches the beauty of this movie. Less fun than global warming. I am usually not that fierce, but I saw it well over ten years ago and thought I was wasting an hour or so of my life on it is destructive. <Br /> <br /> Puerile, plot smaller, useless tosh. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my feet than see it again.
