In Michele Soavia's confusing art house zombie movie, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett, Francesco, a caretaker at a cemetery, where the dead are not buried for too long. With the help of his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco treats the cemetery zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade. But soon after falling to the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his newly interred, Francesco finds himself busier than ever before? <br /> <br /> After getting some very positive comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officianados, I decided to see what it was all about. I just finished watching the movie and I can honestly say that I have not been disappointed by a horror movie for some time. <br /> <br /> With its dull, confused pseudo-philosophical plot, and an extremely bland performance by the leading man Everett, Dellamorte Dellamore is an annoying and babbling mess that doesn't even spattery gore (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and the welcome free nudity (from busty Anna Fialchi) can save. I'm at a loss to understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious lens has received from its misunderstood fans.
