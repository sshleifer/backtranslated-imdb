Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may have problems. Sheba, a private investigator and former policeman, goes to his father's help. But someone will stop by nothing to run her father out of life. An attempt to show their muscles goes wrong and Sheba's father is shot in cold blood. These guys are messing with the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I were to describe Sheba Baby, the best thing I can do is Pam Grier Lite with some really bad plays. For a Pam Grier movie, Sheba Baby is pretty pretty. It's almost as violent as some of her previous films. Gone are the over-the-top pictures of Pam that put a little revolver or razor blade in his afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can't keep a light on some of the real villains that Pam faces in his previous films. It is strictly by the number and has almost a TV atmosphere. As for the bad play, the evil ones Pam faces are so unnatural in their delivery that I have seen. As a result, characters like Pilot do not come across as threatening as they should or should the movie work. <br /> <br /> That is not to say that there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did not enjoy (Pam in a gown and Pam brandishing a spear gun), it is just that when compared to Pam's other movies like Coffy, Foxy Brown, and even Friday Foster that the movie fails. <br /> <br /> A final observation - maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I can't remember a time, even in the security shots 70, when you could take a suitcase full of guns a plane. When Sheba flies to her father's help, she has an arsenal packed in her luggage!
