Maybe we have Aussies just a completely different sense of humor and there is my lie the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which it was) and so when I go into a new one, I always refer to IMDb for as info as genre, runtime, instructor , wires, etc. I noticed that it was a comedy, and then I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted some light and a good laugh. Well, it wasn't! There was absolutely no laugh at all and a tremendous amount of gratuitous profanity (is there REALLY radio ads allowed to broadcast the kind of filth that Steve Jones stands out? What if a decent child happened to be stationing?). <Br /> <br /> Instead of enjoying a good laugh (or even a little giggle) I found it all thoroughly depressing. I've given it 3 out of 10, but to be honest, I don't know what they are 3! I suppose the basics were not so bad! <br /> <br /> We have an apparently quarry loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and stay in what could be a nice apartment ( who pays his rent?) Given the opportunity to form what could have been a kind of meaningful relationship to what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew it! Maybe it was she (Lynn Collins) who earned this movie the 3 points! That she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense ("I do so much in one night, do it as I do in two weeks hairdresser"). <br /> <br /> Unless you want to be depressed and upset, forget about it!
