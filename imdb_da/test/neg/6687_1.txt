Seriously, I couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. For some reason, the author decided to have a lot of actors in random places, caves, groveling, and shouting like Cro-Magnon Bipedier. I understand that it was about gymnastics, but seriously, what about all the roaring and human bleeding? I also saw at least five actors with overactive terrestrial syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. Although this movie actually has human acrobatics, I have to say that it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any understandable form of human speech patterns. This is really a milestone in the film-making story because there was no deliberate decision to get the characters to express anything more than a timely Urrrrr! or Rfff! sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
