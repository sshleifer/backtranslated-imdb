This movie is as bad as it gets. If you like logic (or lack of it) on National Treasure and bad, then it may be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer. In fact, it looks like a poorly produced promo or demo image to promote the people involved (ie, actors, special effects, and so on). Unfortunately, they produce really poor exposure to their lack of talent. In a case like this, the film industry must be ordered to repay money to those customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really miserable.
