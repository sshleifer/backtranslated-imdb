Fame did something strange. It was not just a musical that was originally created on the screen (most are based on Broadway musicals), but it created a television series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct this sentence. Fame is not a musical one. Musicals have song numbers to promote the plot or to show the characters' feelings. The song in this music is not used to doing either; in fact there is no need at all. People sing only randomly to fit into the plot. And that's not the kind of musical I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called Plot of Fame has an attack of characters (all introduced at once - the last time I saw it in a movie [Gosford Park] it had disastrous results) as an audition for and enter in New York High School of Performing Arts. Everyone is in favor of different reasons, ie. recording, song, etc. Quote-unquote drama unfolds like these middle-aged people who pretend to be teens through their four years. My biggest complaint is that high school should be selective. After all, it's a free college and they can't let everyone in. So how is it that some people who are really bad come into college? Obviously, this drama can follow between all these different people. And why is the person billed at the top, not even in the movie, right up to the end, with no reason whatsoever, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations that these unsigned people come into, but you can't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters realize things about themselves during the movie, but you don't understand that because you don't know what they were like in the first place. <br /> <br /> As for the song, it pops up randomly (and must be humorous?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller is all in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, at least. I'd say more, but most of the movie has happily gone out of my head. Just don't see it. You will do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rated for language.
