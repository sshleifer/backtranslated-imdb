Take a couple of dark and stormy nights, fog comes in from the shore, obsessive thoughts and doubts, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hate, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe at night quenching a glowing cigarette blunt and finally a cunning heroine who finds herself threatened so much by her own doubts as by one - but which one? - by the men around her It sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir. Instead, under the leadership of Vincente Minnelli and with two A-lists, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent an almost two-hour matin√©e melodrama, a long slap of threatening anxiety in the midst of the perfectly groomed, coifed and dressed cast. When you look at your watch halfway through a movie and with a sinking heart, you see having another hour to go, both you and the movie probably have problems. <br /> <br /> In one of his earliest non-musical films, Minnelli is not as heavy on the rococo hothouse as he later knew. Still, it is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession that becomes an infinite Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Hepburn shows us in carefully enlightened close-ups how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, dizziness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less together for the trip. <br /> <br /> Hepburn starts the movie as Tomboyish Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with her inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to get her married. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it is love at first glance. Garroway is the smooth, beautiful, dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, which was crucial in the war and made him a burgeoning millionaire producer. He is a captain of the industry, as one of his many Washington friends says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, can still be a bit of tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social host for all the congressmen and judges her husband knows. She learns quickly and eagerly. They are both of course and happily in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The cancer is gnawing. Ann realizes that she doesn't know anything about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem likely to talk to them. As she learns bit by bit, Alan's mother died in the old family's home in Middleburg while sitting on the piano, or that he has a brother, Michael, who has disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes goes to anger. He always apologizes. But wait again. Does his mother really play the piano? Wasn't she really dead in bed? Wasn't Michael caught money from the family business and Alan sent him away? All this plays out against the exquisite hotel suites, the manicured country house in Middleburg with the horse stable and tasteful ranch house by the sea. Everyone in the film, except employees, is dressed for the nines. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black-and-white movie, Minnelli can't help giving us dining tables full of crystal and china, tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of dress. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, when everything is finally known when Ann on horseback is chased along a loud, extremely well-designed mountain trail of the bad guy on another horse when threatened with death by Stone and her successor finally meet with the horse, it is a relief. Even Michael Mitchum, who plays Michael, can't bring much excitement to the movie. What might have been in smaller hands a tight little B movie, instead of the A list, is just an overwhelmed melodrama, too big for its bones.
