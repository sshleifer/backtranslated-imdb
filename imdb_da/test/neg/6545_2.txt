The only interesting part of this movie was the jazz and reggae New Orleans back drop. It tries to be one of the movies that has two struggles the heroine must overcome, one from the past and one from the present which she does not convince. The play is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video. The end result of this movie leaves no one satisfied or convinced to include the actors themselves.
