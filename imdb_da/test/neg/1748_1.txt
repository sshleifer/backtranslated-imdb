I was so offended by this movie that I have to write something about it, so please humor me. The only redeeming virtue beyond any good acting is that it does not go beyond 107 minutes. Even the length is about 30 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> Comparisons have been made here to the brilliant darkness 'The Grifters', but I can't see it. They are two different films entirely. The closest 'Swindled' to an existing movie is' The Sting 'made in 1973. It borrows (sorry STEALS) liberally from this amazing George Roy Hill' entertainment, which is exactly what was. I enjoyed it because it didn't seem to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herring in 'Swindled' that I thought I was in an aquarium. It's very confusing, but it's just one of its many problems. The most important thing is this: If you make a movie where everyone is to everyone else where everyone is coincidental, we have no anchor on the ground. The inevitable result is a mish-mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks. <br /> Just about everyone in this movie is conniving and objectionable. Surely a basic movie 101 class would tell us that the audience should "care" for someone. We can't 'care' for anyone here: they are all pigs. It could have acted as a straight comedy, but it plays it right from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ NOW. BIG 'SPOILER' COMES. SORRY, BUT IT MUST DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much false blood and so many false killings that it does not span credibility - it destroys it. The end is quite ridiculous - a 'murder' in a crowded airport that is not at all a 'murder'? And the 'murdered' guy, blood-soft, simply stands up, brushes off and goes away, fake blood dripping, with the boot? Everything while the police and hordes of people are looking at and no intercedes? The director must have many cojones if he thinks we should buy into this. Noirish B movies from the 1940s did better. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European flicks, but it confirms that Schlock doesn't always come from Hollywood. As far as "Swindled" is concerned, my rating of a famous line from the often untouched producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew all about schlock: 'Include me out'.
