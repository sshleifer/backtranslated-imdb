I don't want to tell the story of the movie that some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the story is. I also don't want to go on with all that is wrong with this movie because I will be here for many years if I do. The story is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should see if you are a serious movie buffer (like most of us here), small things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you are a casual movie guard who likes to have a good time when they see a girl, this movie is perfect for you, much fun. It would also be a good movie to take a partner to. Just not for us movie buffs. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
