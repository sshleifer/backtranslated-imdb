Eating Living is a small movie that opens in New York City and the Arctic, where tribal men shoot snake poison in a few people, then a woman enters the police station trying to find her sister who has disappeared after 6 months Sheila is from Alabama, but her accent sucks, she's with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the movie. They go alone through the Amazon to find a community with people, and they find the sister, they are confronted with a sour man who has probably seen one too many Jim Jones preaches. He will bring them to a better place, it could be heaven, but no, Mark and Sheila find out that later it is actually a suicide cult. <br /> Why do I call Eat Live a "small movie"? I tell you, but when I saw it, I became the floor through all the run-ins with the cannibals, Robert Kerman has a different role than his cannibal holocaust professor. He's a little annoying when we meet him on an arm wrestling match that looked like Russian roulette we know one hard guy. The strong misogyny makes you just hug and it looked like I saw it somewhere, and the animals in the animals kill each other. But the whole movie is about these scenes a picture of nature with parts of a movie But after seeing this movie, I realized that most movie scenes were taken from other cannibal movies, although the death of 2 of the characters is good .. most of the movie is. That's why I call this a little movie when I found out that scenes were borrowed, I felt like throwing the disk over the room, it's not a movie just a simple fitting of varieties.
