This is one of the weird, self-sufficient, self-indulging films that are trying too hard to be profound. It is not. Instead, it spits clichés trying to pass for Profundity. Typically, the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown), how man starts breastfeeding, then moves to suck the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife and eventually ends up life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a number of characters offering their life perspective, the universe, etc. During Adam's journey through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends and fiancé that he is dead when his car was found in a military test area that was smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best way is an escapee from a mental hospital that speaks only through the voices of others. The actor James Kevin Ward makes some amazing impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But when the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the deep. It is a long trip that draws in many places. In fact, it's the longest one and a half hour movie I've ever seen. And the final makes it hardly worth it. <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. It teaches me. Next time I will try harder to sleep in.
