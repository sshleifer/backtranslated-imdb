How this character was ever hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There's no way a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid, and that's probably the meaning of the movie. How they could go all their lives and not see a lift is also enigmatic. I didn't take the movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible plays, and this movie is not fun at all. It's just a boring stupid mess. I liked the mothers clothing myself. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
