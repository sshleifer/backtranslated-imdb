What could have been on Irene Dundee's mind when she accepted the role of this scary account of a woman of negotiable morality? It is determined that Irene Dunne of the 1940s, whose reputation as a faithful Roman Catholic who publicly abhorred slips and removed film scripts or Hollywood societies, which might even be far perceived as a devastating public morality, would never have been associated with such a dubious project like this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps New York gave Cardinal Spellman in her private audience a good dressing over this role? We will probably never know this, as long as she never talked about it in recent years, even though she terminated her moral suspect, 1932 movie, "Back Street" as the "garbage bin". <br /> <br /> Surely when she received the prominent St. The Robert Bellarmine Award in 1965 for exemplary public Catholicism, Ann Vickers was no longer revoked by the public. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say, "Ann Vickers" doesn't work as entertainment or social commentary either. <br /> <br /> Miss Dundee's role as a haughty social worker who sleeps around (between prison reforms and writing a best-seller about correctional rehabilitation) does not diminish with her temper or on-screen demeanor and suspects that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheekbag, (what can we think of when we see a montage of Miss Dunne's sympathetic beatiful look overlaid with a shot of a female prisoner being tormented?) After the film's end, she has rejected career in benefit for marriage (to crusty judge Walter Huston no less - and what kind of lunacy would ever be perceived to pair these two romantic?) Irene Dunne completists will no doubt want to see this curiosity if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her responsibility: "I'm going to get you away from the cold turkey" !!! Well, if nothing else is so bad to go on, she presents her light years from her usual environment of operable trills, furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates - cocaine addiction is not the first issue you associate with irrevocable Miss Dunne.
