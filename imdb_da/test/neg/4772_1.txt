The ruins are for Turistas, as Deep Impact was for Armageddon, a worse version of a mildly entertaining film, except much much worse. One of the signs must go to medical education, so why are they all retarded? "You can't keep cutting." - Best line form this movie. This is a horrible movie. I like horror movies, but fully understand that most of them are horrible, but had little hope for this movie after seeing the reviews on IMDb. The situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. It's terrible, the only thing that makes it a bit tasty is its cool Australian background, despite using the vast majority of the movie in one place.
