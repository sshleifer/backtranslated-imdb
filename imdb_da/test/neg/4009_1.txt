It has a bit of the indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and that places an explicit sales date on the visual style. Signs are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan. Street hoodlums in Greece carry new clothes outside the box without curls or stains. They all seem to visit the same marine hairdresser. All uniformly exhibit the same low IQ when making their inappropriate underground business connections. When things go wrong, it is all because they are not real Greeks - they are pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night world. Make a big gut about disaffected immigrants, but never bother to actually investigate the issues of Russian / Kazakh / Albanian culture. If Giannaris had the right perspective on this project, it could have made a wonderful Bel Ami production. The fleeting glimpse of toned chicken meat is the only spark in this generic little gangster programmer.
