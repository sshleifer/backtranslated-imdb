Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He has another approach to the madman. He carries out unorthodox treatment methods. He treats everyone as a family, there are no locks on the patient doors, and he lets some of the inmates act out of their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) is the mother of a doll, including letting her put it to bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens, without letting judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) cut a log with an ax, turns out to be a bad move as Dr. Stevens's back is turned, the plant condemns the ax in his shoulder. Shortly after, the nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives to Sanitarium after arranging an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She meets the main nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams), and offered a track position. She gets to know and likes the patients. But things are beginning to get miserable, the telephone lines are being cut, an old lady named Mrs Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has cut her tongue out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right on someone manner. Then one night all Sanitarium's dark secrets are apparently revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this movie has a good central idea that builds on a cool twist ending but ultimately is a bit of a task to sit through because of the low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are just too many long boring lines of dialogue from the inmates, not much really happens until the last 20 eight minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it is set entirely in the Sanitariet, and these are reasons that are largely a big bland house in the middle of heaven. There are no graphical things in it, a few splashes of blood here and there and that's a lot for you. There is a bit of nudity, but not so much. The action is quite strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and unexciting, and I can't even remember what the music was. The twist end is great but it just takes far too long to get to it. A movie that had a lot of potential that was probably detained by that budget. OK I guess, but I think it would have worked much better if the story had been transformed into a half-hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.
