In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) seeks an opportunity to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from his former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up in the phone and the disturbed and amorous Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo arrives in London, he concludes that his desire for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior. <br /> <br /> "Transgredire" is another "soft porn" by the sick director Tinto Brass with a low and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to reveal the intimate parts of the women in the cast. The amateur camera exposes the body of the beautiful Yuliya Mayarchuk in every possible angle, and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her lovely body, but without showing explicit penetration. This flick is recommended only to fans of this instructor and as a voyeur experience to see the Yuliya Mayarchuk nude in erotic situations. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pervertida" ("The Pervert")
