This movie proves a theory I've had for some time - in Australia, as long as a movie deals with the right topic, it will be a success no matter how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz may not be worse - the play is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a bad Warrior's knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea of ​​ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang of the 21st century Sydney! The last one Once any Irish gang was in Australia, it was about a hundred years ago in Tinker's time!) But because of ethnic rivalry, one of four topics that are successful in the Australian cinema (along with fighting families, minority groups, and biography) is guaranteed. of a famous Australian) it won several academic awards. I always suspect that Australian critics will clear up any waste that deals with these issues, but some of me believed or at least hoped they had their borders. This movie otherwise proves. So for all of your Australian hopeful filmmakers out there, don't mind thinking about your movie or choosing people who can actually act or even get your facts right - just write a bad family script trying to make ends meet or any of a foreign race comes to Australia and has to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or if you want to take a leaf out of those people's book, some ethnic gangs are fighting another ethnic gang that is not actually plausible in The period the movie is set and your movie will win five academic awards no matter how pathetic it is!
