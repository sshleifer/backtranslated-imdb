This 1988 movie was recently shown on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie supposedly started, but because a mix, Rent-a-Cop, was shown during that time. Never seen it since it was commercially released, we took a chance on it. A bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonders what the people are behind the image to continue with "Rent-a-Cop" or how they sold it to the study behind the distribution. It seems that this movie is erroneously big time. This movie does not add anything new to its genre. It is quite predictable, as when the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or maybe the direction Jerry London gave him had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has one expression throughout the film. He just doesn't register any feeling at all. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the Chicago Hotel, makes no sense at all. The romance between her Della and Church seems false from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds plays one-dimensional characters. Don't waste your time with this turkey.
