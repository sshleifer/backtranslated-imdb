I just wanted to leave a quick comment as it didn't listen here, but I just watched this movie, the version I just rented was released in 2005 as far as I know, and it was actually called "Don't go into the ceiling" I only understood that it was the same movie as Devils Harvest when they searched for some of the actors who then knew about the movie. Anyways I'm in Ireland so maybe this has only been released here and in the UK now, but that's what it's called here .......... not really it matters because I wouldn't recommend this movie. The only word that gets in the way of seeing it is CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE !! My one mark out of ten is exclusively for the one small jumped bit: o)
