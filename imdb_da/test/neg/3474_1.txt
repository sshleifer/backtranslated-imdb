Perhaps we are too much attached to big glasses when we hear of antiquity brought on the screen. Maybe we expect too much of these movies. But if we, as viewers, are offered too little, what happens then? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, part of the Roman Empire production series. AUGUST by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM movie, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this movie contain? <br /> <br /> Almost something accurate. The historical flaws are so serious that the film changes the facts and rather constitutes a distorted picture of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see Nero Young: young man during the supposedly long reign of Caligula, young man during the Claudius kingdom and finally during his own (historically 14 year long) reign. And ... he dies the same. According to the film, Nero, born under the Tiberius government, lives for more than 40 years, but seems to be in his late twenties when he dies ... Continuity combined with finished history is the biggest problem in the movie which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable. Nero loses his father, raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agrippina, was banished by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries Emperor Claudius, who already has large children with fresh married to him Messalina. At these moments in the film, we see Acte (Rich Schmid), Nero's mistress. Okay, it's historically "accurate"; However, no source shows that she played a crucial role in the uprising of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devoted Christian, but even a witness to St Paul's miracle (he brings back a young girl Marzia to life). In addition, Nero was historically not seen at the Caligula Court since Nero was born in Caligula's 4-year reign (A.D. 37-41). I understand that movies can change, but such a mistake makes the script completely unreliable! And many many other shortcomings regarding content that is hard to count, but after 30 minutes watching this movie I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy. Regarding its artistic features, which provide us with entertainment, they are just as paralyzed as the story here is. The performance is artificial, the cast simply has beautiful faces, but weak actions. Maybe I'm too much attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson doesn't fit Nero at all. He could have some of the good moments as an actor, but never as the infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome to a song? Is he a cynic who spoils the love of his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "alleged justice"? None of these. He's just a young man who doesn't know how to control and in the long run begins to release the fire that burns in itself. John Simm is out of place in this movie as Caligula and absolutely subordinate to other portraits of Character. Elisa Tovati is only sexy as Poppaea; but she could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze. Low budget result in low effects and thus low entertainment. But what made me most angry with this movie and as a result I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - Death of Poppaea and St Paul with Nero in her body of death, <br /> <br /> - Claudius's mention of the current conquest of Britain at the party and soon his death (he conquered Britain while Messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus kills Agrippina ( Laura Morante), Nero's mother <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in the speech of senators <br /> - Finally, Nero's death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to morality, said by Acte "Let us forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a waste of time and is absolutely unnecessary as yet another production of the Roman Empire. It is better to make a good film about 30 years than ten minors for 5 years. 1/10 - shouldn't have been at all.
