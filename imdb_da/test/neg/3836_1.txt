The worst movie I've ever seen. I still don't understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had bills ... The best and cool part happens during a backlink that brings us during World War II when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. It is the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be fixed in the early 80s, but then a New Beattle ... appears amazing! This movie was directed in 2001 ... I am absolutely sure it took less than two weeks to make that movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife asked for divorce when she saw the picture and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted being the man under the yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!
