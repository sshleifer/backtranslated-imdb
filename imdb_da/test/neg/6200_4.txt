I was really ready to see when two of the best film critics took this movie as a "grin riot". But the film turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be asked to watch this movie that keeps the brain at home, but you simply cannot ignore the mistakes and shortcomings. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda couples looked horrible. (He is 49 and she is only 24 ... more than double of her age) 3. Salman's comedy is less to act and more overactive. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs are good but interrupt the pace of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes were deliberately attempted by the filmmakers to be fun and 6. Poor and flawless history. <br /> <br /> However, there are few pluses - 1. Govinda. Great Individual Performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> 3. Katrin Kaif. Looks and Acting continue to improve with each movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Rajpal Yadav's Don sequences. Although underutilized but fun. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad .. this will be 4/10.
