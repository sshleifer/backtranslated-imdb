This would probably be a good movie to see .... provided you have already seen all other movies in existence and thoroughly examined yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly opaque, with some of the worst (or non-existent) films ever recorded on film. There is no saving grace for this movie; Even the animatronics are a little weak, and it's just a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Quick. It is beyond terrible. <br /> <br />
