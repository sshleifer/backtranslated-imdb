In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (like Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking part of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hops branded and thrown into a torture prison; there he is raped. Upon release, Hopper picks up aboriginal David Gulpilil (like Billy) with whom he seeks revenge on sadistic Bill Hunter (like Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (like Detective Mainwaring) and others. Eventually, revenge becomes heroic; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and chased by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "hardly human" performance certainly fits into the diverse sense of the movie. Sir. Gulpilil has a strong backing. The staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" does not just make it worth a visit, but also a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
