As a semi-movie buff, I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a $ 15 million film about the Roman emperor Caligula's tyrannical regime, complete with hard grain pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie, but it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it !! ?? A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel, and this movie came back in my head and finally my curiosity became the best of me, I hired the DVD stupidly and fooled it even more foolishly. <br /> <br /> During the first 30 minutes I watched acts of sex and especially violence that would serve an NC-17 even to today's standards. It was really necessary to have a scene of a man who had his urine trace closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic detail). And a scene where a guy gets his d *** cut off and fed to dogs (again in very graphic detail) .... and it just scratches the surface. The argument for this movie from those who like it, thinks it is the only movie that honestly portrays pagan Rome, and it's abundance. In fact, what this movie really is is pure exploitation. From the beginning to the end you see nothing but endless torture, and beheader and any kind of violence and gross behavior that can be imagined (sadomasochism, rape, nekrophelia, it's just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, which could have caused him to become angry, the horrible childhood he had that cast him into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historical movie, it is sleaze. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this, since I didn't gagging, I was just incredibly bored. When it was over, I was depressed, not feeling as much as eating, and this movie makes it impossible, it can actually beat you away from sex. What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. I read that the porn segments were filmed after the main shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors must have known what they came in. Right from the opening credit, "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents" are listed. And the scenes in which the famous actors actually participate are completely abominable in themselves. Apparently, director Tinto Brass wanted his name to be removed from the finished film, just like the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole asked people not to see this when they were opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the quality of the movie is terrible. Everything is subdued and creepy as if the movie was dropped in a swamp before it was developed, and that is when you are lucky enough to see a scene that is actually in focus. The sound is badly duplicated, much of the music is awkward, and editing is godly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this movie to myself. My advice ... do not look at this, do not look at this, do not look at this ...... as for myself tomorrow, I need to see something brighter .... like the DEATH OF THE DEATH!
