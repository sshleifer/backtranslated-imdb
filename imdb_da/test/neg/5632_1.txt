This movie was a clean trash can. Not the worse movie ever. If it were to be broken down, the play was good enough to finish the work, but the manuscript was so out there and so stupid that you were thinking: "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ who I love (and that's why I saw this) was wasted. Totally wasted. She didn't even leave an impression. The management was so remote that none of the characters left me much of anything, but to see Redgrave leave nothing. Her part was nothing. She was good as an intermediary, but it was. Make depth and she has given depth to small roles ~ see Venus and Atonement. I wouldn't waste my time and was sorry to have spent $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. No return. Skip movie over. It will only give you grief ... and boredom.
