I received this movie in a package called "50 All-Star Movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This one was horrible. It was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better. A curly ex-jock dares to train a team of young criminals. They learn from him that they can do it if they play by the rules. I'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can't imagine what the people who launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already overwhelmed topic. I continued to wait to see the 'new twist' or 'new angle' but honestly it doesn't. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want the 96 minutes in my life back.
