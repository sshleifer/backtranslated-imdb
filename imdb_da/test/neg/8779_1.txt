I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80s. First, it sounded like a good idea. A tale of an American classic using modern film techniques of the day. There was a bit of a back lash over the treatment of the original "Lone Ranger", Clayton Moore. The film studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued to portray himself as the real lonely ranger. (Moore performed at children's hospitals like the Lone Ranger for Sick Children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the only lonely ranger. I had always felt that the studio could have been entitled to both fans and heritage from the lonely ranger if Moore had been treated better. Maybe even a como in the new movie. Where it was, that was not the case, and many of the audience stayed away in the evening. The story and the action were also weak. All this added a great office bomb and rightly so. I am personally happy that the studio lost big money according to the way the real Lone ranger was treated. You do not treat an American icon that way.
