Well, Anne is too old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he shouldn't. Louisa is too young and too cheerful Oh sister Mary is too beautiful. She must be average, not beautiful. When this actress complains about how Mary should do everything I think is that she is too beautiful to be complaining. Lady Russell is too old. This is insane. If you read the novel, she's Anne's older more mature friend, maybe as old as Anne's mother would be, which would be about 18-20 years older than Anne - then about 50 NOT 70! It's crazy, doesn't fit. So where is Anne so happy at first? She smiles when she says "Oh the worst is over, I've seen him now the worst is gone" yes right. OK, if anyone saw the 1995 Roger Michell version than you can't compare these two. One is right on. This one is far away. Read the short story and you know what I mean.
