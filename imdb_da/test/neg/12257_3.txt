A truly weird, surreal dream of visual ideas that probably looked so incredible on the printed page; Just what Robert Redford took for the project, you can never know. Sidney J. Furie leads this knockabout journey of a selfish motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the child looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to monkey his amorality. Disjointed and dissuasive - although some of them do not think that Redford is capable of disrobeing, being able to disturb or have been denied, is enough to justify attention. Lauren Hutton also gets naked, but all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the clever who's simply no story. Perhaps Furie made an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. If that is true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach followed, as the film was not a success. * 1/2 from ****
