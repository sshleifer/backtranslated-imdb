This DVD is almost 30 minutes long and has boring interviews that reveal that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of about 30. But these aspects are least problematic here. The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (The only reason I say "one of" instead of "it" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) As Ed Gein's girlfriends, this band's music is blended from old metal cliches to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. In fact, their image is fun; Their videos are like excerpts of cheesy horror movies, therefore they at least fulfill some purpose as entertainment. However, their music consists of nothing of quality - at all: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-one-million times before played-exclusively on guitar-neck riffs that are not related to each other and yet randomly grouped together to form "songs" that have no connection, no highlights, nothing. But if the riffs are really bad then the vocals are even worse: Slipknot singer has a stereotypical and hence uninteresting "evil" roar - the kind of 90% of all metal bands today - but it is nothing compared to when this fake hick begins trying to sing! Still, what could you expect? Rule 39 in the "Nu Metal" handbook says quite clearly: "You will grow and sing alternately. Ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well because most of your fans are so dead that they will love you even you **** into the microphone. "Slipknot is in their absolute worst when their" singer "begins to hang out" tunes ". <br /> <br /> But back to their picture. It is stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from anyone other than Mr.Bungle. Have you never heard of them? Of course you don't. You only listen to nu-metal, and Mr.Bungle is quite far from it, and beyond any categorization anyway. They also had masks - grotesque, horror, similar to Slipknot I could add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This band, whose frontman is Mike Patton from Faith No More, never hit it big because their music was not aimed at the average music fans (to say the least). So basically Slipknot is just the original in the picture department. They have nothing new to offer and will therefore be forgotten for several years: When the masks become boring for the legions of their sit-facing fans, which is when Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music. <br /> <br /> Talking about Mike Patton, it is interesting that a number of now-metal bands often place his song as a major influence. Predictably - and fortunately - Patton is not flattered by this and has refused to be proud of any influence on one of the worst metal sub-genres ever ... <br /> <br /> When it is That said, enjoy this short DVD and the cheap tensions it can give to the untrained ear and bored eye ... And then polish these Slipknot posters, for in a few years no one will take care of them, the poor deer. <br /> <br /> After seeing Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed," I finally understand why he is wearing a mask: he is a bluish baby-faced ginger that looks like Dave Mustaine's younger brother! Not exactly scary. <br /> <br /> For several of my music world clubs, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br/> <br /> You must punish me hard, very hard, by clicking on "no" below.
