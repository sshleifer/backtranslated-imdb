I think this movie had a really poor production value. Lack of action makes me believe that they should mark it as an early docudrama. It may not have had any money available. I feel bad that it was a ruffle ride in Major League for Jackie Robinson. <br /> <br /> I think he was much better than many of the white players in his day. He had to be really good at breaking the color barrier of the time. No one to get around, it was a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> Want more information on its decision makers. They may have been limited by the quality of players willing to take on the project. Maybe no money to get good people.
