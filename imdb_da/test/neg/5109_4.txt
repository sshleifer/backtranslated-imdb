From the brilliant mind that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruising." Unfortunately, "rampage" is more like the latter. It's an extremely messy movie that has a great TV mood going for it. The whole movie pretends to hang on to the question: "What if" Boy Next Door "was a serial killer?" but instead it becomes an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on insanity and the death penalty that makes no sense. The movie is very loosely based on the Richard Trenton Chase case and strikes a few facts here and there to make a false character and another result. One of the main points of the movie seems to be ending the life of a terminal braindead child and ending the life of a killer is somehow analagous. "Sometimes you just have to choose," says the protagonist. Yes, sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug ... on your TV!
