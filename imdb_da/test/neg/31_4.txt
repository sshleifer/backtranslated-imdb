It hurt to see this movie, it really did ... I wanted to like it, even go inside. Shots obviously for very little money, I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I appreciated the film at this level, the play and editing were terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were serious thumbs up territory. A 95-minute movie should not pull. The judgments for this are so far good, but I'm afraid that friends and family might have had a word in one. What were these transitions? Dear Sir Editor, Did you just buy your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the cool transitions that come with the stupid application? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion and a little more appealing editing, and that makes a decent movie.
