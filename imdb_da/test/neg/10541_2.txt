Yes, a long time ago it became a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with a junior high school, but there's lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess that's how it is like a prison. Not really myself. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, gets caught in jail, he is stuck in the queue and walks over to another line so he can talk to his friend as if queuing for airport security check. So for a long time, he and his friend throws a blow, tastes around a few security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You are attacking a corrective officer in a federal prison, they are shooting you on the spot. Yes Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second blow. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Confederate prison. <br /> <br /> You can't dress like that at most colleges in America. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person likely to have performed more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, might have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of these shows on television about the greatest celebrity fights ever, and as number 7 or 8, this rivalry was between 50 cents that had lived life in reality and Ja Rule. Who didn't. Every time I saw Yes Rule on the screen the only thing I could see was that 50 Cent laughed his ass out. Yes Rule looks like a tough 9 year old every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, come back to the plot. It is fun. Sasha is an FBI agent who works undercover and he agrees to be sentenced to jail so he can get behind the criminal organization. He is sentenced to five years, and the old line between determination and stupidity disappears immediately. Nothing else in the movie means that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences, most of which are not even well-choreographed. <br /> <br /> What happens to this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of "New Alcatraz" at some point, accidentally releasing all the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without as much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid that they might as well have played hopscotch. So some guys are sentenced to be the first person to ever perform in Alcatraz's top competition, apparently not stealing $ 200 million in gold, but not to tell where it was hidden when he was caught. <br /> <br /> Hello, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. It's a great way to learn the truth! So some gangs break into prison planning to stop the execution and get the $ 200 million position for themselves. <br /> <br /> Oh and the $ 200 million is in gold. I doubt they believed in how difficult it would be to turn it into an exploitable currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the issue of the workshop in prison. He's some hard-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio reminding me of a joke. I once saw this comedian talking about people in California who are talking hard and calling each other and home and every other kind of nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they are like, "Oh my god! People live there? It's like a total shack!" <br /> <br /> The best thing is when US Supreme Court Justice arrives, and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their weapons in his prison, "I don't care if she is a US Supreme Court! " This woman could make him squeeze him like a grape, and he thinks he is responsible. Ha. <br /> <br /> By the way, the justice of the Supreme Court, hosted by the film, is the evil guy that she is 53. It's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was fun. The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is wrapped around in the prison like a bag of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. It was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> You know I'm working for the company that produced this movie (as I why I saw it) and I still haven't got one positive thing to say about it, except of course for the one scene with Ja Rule being spanked by the Asian woman. <br /> <br /> Then read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie, Ebert wrote something that I agreed with so much like anything else he ever wrote: <br /> <br /> "I imagine the flywheels on MPAA congratulate each other on a good day's work when they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13 after giving anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' en R. "Way to go boys.
