I'm still waiting for the dark muppet movie, where we don't know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could make a hoarse experiment with animation. This time I was intelligent not expecting such a thing but deeply wanted. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a made-for-TV level, which lazily seemed like this with the clich√© of cynic. Muppets were more lifelong than she was. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie, bar Pepe. I loved him. He was the only one who ever made me laugh (while Goldbergh as God made me choke and curse). If we can't see a dark muppet than what with at least one PG: 13 one with several of Peep's controversial jokes and animal metal head, egg-chuggin persona. <br /> <br /> The worst Muppets I saw even the boring Christmas Carol knocks this one out. Muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday. <br /> <br /> 5/10
