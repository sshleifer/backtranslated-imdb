When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "Hey, what dunk it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and went home to see it. When I inserted it into my DVD player, I was shocked. Well, first of all, nobody told me it was a Mexican movie and was spoken in Spanish, good things had subtitles. <br /> <br /> OTHER, it was nude, nude NUDE! Since I have no background in Mexican movies, you could see my shock when I saw it. *GASP! Covering Virgin Eyes, NOO * THIRD, predictable to say the least, but actually being predictable, was no excuse for me to like movies because I didn't seem to care about it being predictable unless it's way over the top. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, how Heidi and Kike were reunited, so cheesy. <br /> <br /> Fifth, how the movie ended. It was a bad, bad ending. How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping that he was not so easy to accept what the director could just hasten. <br /> <br /> After all this bashing of the bad things, the good stuff has come here. The movie was actually quite hilarious at some point, with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and everything, Heidi's attitude, Valentina is poetic with words. What I really like about it was the song that Valentina made with her girl friend. That's all, and for the other things I haven't mentioned, they were just so-so.
