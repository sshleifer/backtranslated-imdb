I was surprised that the film's makers actually came out, saying this movie was a true story. Most of the scenes looked fake to me. For example, when one girl ate her sandwich and there was a roach in it. While she was eating the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. It's fun how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich, when the girl ate it. Another scene is when the gang went to open a closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown out to give it effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is very doubtful that the events that happened were true that night when "St. Francisville Experiment" took place. I think the house can be haunted, but not at night the movie was filmed! The end was entertaining when Tim and another girl were chained in some sort of basement. Paul and Madison found them and rescued them! I'd rather see the Blair Witch Project again, so I have to sit through St. Francisville Experiment movie again. As I said, if the film's makers didn't say this was a true story of true events, I might like it more. You're better off getting more entertainment from the Blair Witch Project (though it's not a true story either) !!!
