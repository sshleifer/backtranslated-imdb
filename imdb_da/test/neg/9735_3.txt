I was hoping to learn something from this movie, but I was disappointed. It's about Rommel and lauds as a great general, but in no time throughout this film we ever got an idea of ​​why he was great. What made him so successful? Was it his drive, his reluctance to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a Patton-like representation that really comes into the character, but it went far flat. Most of the dialogue is constructed and sensationalized and feels outdated and artificial. There are some good actions here and there, but not much. The end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler, was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. But as a history lesson on Germany's greatest general, this was a failure.
