The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a miserable, uninspired gentle story, without imagination. Why then completely rewrite a wonderful sci-fi classic? Is today's movie audience for the hip of H.G. Wells write pretty much the way it is? The 1960s George Pal version told a much more unique story, even with lumpy, low-budget effects, the beach-party appearance of Eloi and Morlocks, resembling Smurfer on steroids. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version must have HG Wells turning in its grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is a old sci-fi cliché. This distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) That made the 1960 edition so endearing. This puts an unfortunate and distracting tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein have realized the time paradox dilemma ?? not having the dawn on him 800,000 years in the future ?? from a Morlock no less, Doh !! What's wrong with time driving just for fun and adventure and curiosity - as described in the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you saw the first movie would you even realize what Pearce did to the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal movie carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​'travel', although a fourth dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look like a geeky, a worn out old stereotypical scientist. In the 1960s, Rod Taylor was also a little nerdy (at least around Weena), but managed to be sneaky, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 60's version - abandoned in remake - is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Breaking the moon to destroy humanity is meaningless - and it doesn't do much for science skills. For over 4 billion years, the Moon has slightly stronger powerful asteroid effects, which would make any nuclear equipment a firework. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but it's just stupid and pointless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is also stupid. Apparently, our traveling neutron bomb invented this thing. Blowing the Machine to Kill Morlocks is a kind of "outfit" machina ex machina 'In return, Pearce never returns to the 1800s to tell his story to his incredible friends, an important part of the Wells story with the irony of a week goes the journey in the long term and back. <br /> <br /> 6. When Morlocks runs around the day, it completely destroys H.G. Wells' wonderful spooky, ghoulish depiction of them as shady creatures of the night. A real cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells portrayed Eloi as fragile and childish. These guys in the movie looked as if they could go on Morlocks if they weren't so big baby wusses. <br /> <br /> 7. One wise Morlock ?? kind of a bleached Star Wars Evil Emperor - had potential but is so boring and secluded that he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home? Boy, what a dramatic highlight! In the book, the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and struggle to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The goof ball hologram on N.Y. Public Library is too much. It shows the light of the idea of ​​human cannibalism. The 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that provided a chillingly somber eulogy for humanity. The play evolution is serious. It is sad that the wonderful effects of this movie can never compensate for a tired, built-up clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket and popcorn and let the DVD when it comes out (soon without a doubt). At least you can quickly believe the boring parts, like our time traveler.
