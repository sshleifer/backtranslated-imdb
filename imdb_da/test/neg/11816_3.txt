The title gives you almost what you get. It's a class C howler but not as incredibly fun as I hoped. Directed by the development film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before instructed "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this film of low budget 1972 was, of course, filmed in the Philippines, but put into an anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and retailer Lee Daniels, superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while the long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the second half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary leader to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. They are, of course, antagonistic to each other, they are in a woman's prison camp, where they wear unexplained bright yellow mini skirts as uniforms. Run by a wardrobe and lecherous matron, jail is just an excuse for a prolonged shower scene and some half-hearted fights when Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape, but are linked together with the "Defiant Ones" and continue the cat fight until they attack a few nuns to steal their habits. Meanwhile, different groups of invisible men in persecution - the loutish drug gentleman is looking for Lee who stole $ 40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen and the incompetent police (suffering the humiliation to expose their individuals to the lord of the substance ). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to mind, but not before the free news of a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen panties and some of the worst 1970's men's fashion (a beer belt revolutionary carries a leather lame top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but it is really sad how much of the potential black comedy is completely missed in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointing in this excursion because her character is not much to do beyond dealing with everything "jive" while Markov is an Amazonian blonde, whom I am convinced, desperately trying to be credible. As no one shows any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except for balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as a drug master. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an option.
