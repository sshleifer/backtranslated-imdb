According to "Lucien Rebatet" in his "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338), Beethoven's character was not particularly compatible with women. He had a series of "Platonic Passions" with female members of "Vienese Aristocracy", to which he dedicated some "sonatas". But musicians, even composers did not qualify for men of "fine ladies". Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died of drinking or poisoning, and Bethoven was, according to Rebate, a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. A British cinema, Newman, says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before he was 40. That he was deaf because of it is possible, but not safe. The ninth symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824 in the Kärntnertorth Theater in Vienna, along with the inauguration of House Overture and the first three parts of Missa Solemnis. This was the composer's first appearance of twelve years; the hall was packed. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf, the theater's Kapellmeister, Beethoven was divided the stage with him quietly. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this "Female Fantasy". Ed Harris's interpretation and characterization is pretty good, but for linear, based on the painting by Ferninand Waldmüller date 1823. I have it in front of me. It shows a man who despises (maybe hates) the world. With good reason.
