One of the worse surfing movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. Okay, let's start with the premise - a guy from the mainland who hardly knows how to surf travel to Hawaii and go into a big wave competition that he more or less expects to win. A good analogy for those who did not surf would be one of a grossly obese chain smoker who relaxed a few running shoes and entered the LA Marathon with expectations of winning. No way! And the competition is being held at The North Shore, which produces images of 15 + footers, but competition day is the waves maybe 6 feet. The play? What is shopping? If you have to see this woof watch it on TV, don't waste your money renting it. If you want to see a pretty good surfing movie - given, it's wrong, but it's another story - rent Big Wednesday.
