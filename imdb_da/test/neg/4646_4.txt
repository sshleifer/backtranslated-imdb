Now I've read the book first and thought: wow it would be cool to watch a movie than I started searching and found that there was already a movie made of it ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and so it .. they made it terribly wrong! in the first place this child is Hapi, who is not a character in the book, so the mixture between the two books ('the river god' and 'the seventh roll') than Nicolas needs funds in the book, he himself is in fact the whole thing is also wrong with Hyksos. Taila should have invented the lightweight wagon .. the whole grip on the tomb is also very wrong .. there must be a channel that has some kind of vacuum suck on it. The tomb itself is made in a maze with only one opportunity to pass if you know the rules of the old boa game. There was nothing in the movie that Nicolas was English, and Royan was a Coptic Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were few things good about the movie, the actors who played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well-chosen, the rest were just parodies of the letters, Rasfer was the worst, it didn't come close to the character in my head, while writing the book .. It is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a poor reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith has ever given his permission for this ..
