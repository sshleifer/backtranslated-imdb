This could have been a breakout role for Valeria Golino, but the film instead chose to shift its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and mother of three. She is a free spirit and prone to outbreaks, so the rest of the village and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa outside Sicily, and it shows everyday life there with teenage boys in raging gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun-drenched stone. Grazia's eldest son Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) loves her and always tries to protect her during the depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a thriving young girl betrayed by a local policeman and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very sassy and mocks the cop's accent. After learning that she has to be sent to Milan, Grazia runs away and Pasquale helps her save her in a cave while everyone is searching for her. This movie could really have made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus on Grazia. We see some outbreaks and irrational behavior on her side, but theirs is no follow-up on these scenes. Nothing comes of it. The movie looks good and is beautifully photographed, so give the director Emanuele Crialese the credit for it, but the story needed to focus on something more important. The film does a good job of showing us how life is on this island and what happens in the lives of the three children when they grow up. There is some speculation that Golino's character gives a hint of being a mermaid as a creature, and therefore she has difficulty living on land. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way, and if you do not, you may be exposed to the harsh realities of its rules. All speculation, but I think the film's attention could have been with Grazia's character. When she hides in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a way, the character becomes stagnant. I wish Golino had more to do because I always wanted her, and when she's on the screen, you just can't take her eyes off her. She is a bundle of rage, passion and raw energy! What a shame Crialese did not write a more complete role for her to trade in. When the movie ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story.
