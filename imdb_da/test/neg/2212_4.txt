Yes, it can't be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you don't think about it, it's really not that bad. The story has Alvin and his gang, going across the world in search of a bad person and the misadventures they come into contact with. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good and the story is cute, and the songs are forgettable, but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars.
