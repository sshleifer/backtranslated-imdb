Back in the 1960s, those of us who were poor movie plays believed that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made and would stay so forever. To put things in perspective, we also thought that $ 3,000 was a lot to pay for a new car. As we got older, our innocence was gradually removed when we were exposed to films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at Memory Bank", which completely redefined the "bad movie" genre. In this context, in my evening, my son and I saw "Alien From L.A.", which pushed the envelope into an extremely unimaginable one-generation ago. Calling this movie "bad" (or miserable or executable) completely fails to do it justice, just as there is another label in English. Although there were words to accurately describe this movie, it would have no consequence as they would be banned in civilized society. Alien mentioned in the title is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took some time to model swimwear for Sports Illustrated, to start his cinematic career. Her casting may seem a kind of recommendation until you actually see the movie. The makeup artists made their money by making Kathy look so boring and unappetizing that you would not touch her with the distant end of a costume spree. To put it all, in this movie she has a face that would freeze Medusa. Even worse than her appearance was her voice, which was so generous that I initially failed to credit it as a human origin. Throughout the film, I found myself longing for a tablet to draw my nails across to cover the screaming twang of her dialogue. At the end of the movie, Kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if they had put her in the swimsuit at the beginning of the movie, so at least we would have had something to see. My son nicely pointed out that if they had removed the swimsuit and filled it in their mouths, it would have significantly improved the film on two points. I postpone to the smooth gloss of his observation. If in doubt, compare this dragon to "Barbarella", where a skilled filmmaker shows how to utilize an ethereally beautiful leading female's qualities in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> The plot itself has little to comment on as there was little evidence. It is said that if a million monkeys entered uninterruptedly for millions of years, one would eventually come up with "Hamlet". In the process of elimination, the rest of the time will come up with something that is approaching this manuscript. Imagine if you want a modern Alice to fall into a hole and drop 500 meters on a stone slab, then get up, bump into herself and start looking for her far-lost father in the city's kingdom of Atlantis. Once in Atlantis, she spends most of her time driving, fighting or climbing stairs and rising, and essentially trying to keep off a generals hands that seem to have no soldiers to do their bidding and who would make little Tim se macho. This summary, as abbreviated as it looks, is probably longer than the shoot script. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, which you enjoy in the production values ​​and take in what you can of the sets and costumes through smoke and drop, you realize that this is a movie where you can actually see on the screen where everyone $ 20 of the budget went. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​holding through my heart was that filmmakers should not be given access to drugs and alcohol while shooting a movie or perhaps earlier, if it leads to results like "Alien from LA" even though in fairness I must admit that I do not know if they were actually involved in drug abuse or were simply brain dead at the start of the project.
