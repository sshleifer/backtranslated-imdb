This is the biggest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, it makes a terrible sequel and destroys the first. Now I'm not mistaken, I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I liked the third one really good, but this movie is horrible. I am a great fantasy / sword & wizard movie fan and I hated to see such a horrible sequel made for such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the whole idea of ​​the film is ridiculous. Dar and his wicked older brother Arklon (who was not mentioned in the first movie ... Hi?) Crossing into our world through a practical dimensional time gateway. You can see that the earth is just on the same parallel interdimensional plane as Dar's world. While with the first movie, you are led to believe that the movie is just happening in the past, but with this you have shown that it is a completely different world altogether ... it's just one of the many things I hated about this successor. It didn't work with "Masters of the Universe" and it doesn't work here either! Movies like this must take place and stay in their own timeline and their usual surroundings. For Christ's sake, what's next? Hercules in New York ... is, uh .. bad example! Moves on ... Arclon after a unit called a neutron detonator to use as a threat to its enemies to control its own kingdom. So it is up to Dar, his ferret, his eagle and his tiger (not a spray one this time) to go out and save the world ... but along the way, they help a young, cool, and hip Senator's daughter who gets caught Throughout this mess and she shows Dar around LA, takes him to a joyride in his BMW, and helps him get him in tight situations here and there. How practical right? And in terms of practicality, I found it very comfortable and easy for the Arklon to sneak into a heavily guarded military base and get away with a stolen, highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and L.A.P.D. after him .... waaaaay for easy, even for a wicked barbaric wizard from another world. There are so many plot holes in this I don't know where to start; just as why did Arklon go to L.A. zoo at the end of the movie?!? He has absolutely no reason to go there; And wouldn't it be the last place you would lure your greatest enemy, just so to have the practical ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And you just love these kind of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at a guy, are they still unable to hit him? The police in this movie belong in the "Police Academy" series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the movie's title makes no sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they never went through an "hour" portal because the movie is not set in the future of Dar's world, it is set in a parallel world along our in the astral plane so they never go through time, only a dimensional world along their; so NO real time travel is at all involved! This movie is trying to come out as fun and it does ... not because of humor, but because it's just so bad ... and it puts it mildly. The action, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the end are all so cheesy it's fun. What more can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad sequel)? Very missed here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful management and serious feeling of the first !! Avoid this smelly piece of garbage as a bubonic plague and stick as the first and maybe the third if there is nothing better on T.V.
