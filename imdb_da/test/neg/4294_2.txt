"The Yoke's on Me" is undoubtedly the most controversial movie in Stooges' 23 year shorts. The reason is understandable; According to today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown if it is ever on television. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that the Japanese in the movie were not soldiers; they were Japanese-Americans sent to a floating center during World War II. They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this movie. In all accounts - including the US government making an excuse and replacement in the 1980s - the Japanese Americans during World War II were just as loyal and hardworking as any American. Their prison during this time is a dark blut in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some Stooge laughs in this movie, but the memories of how Japanese-Americans were treated during this time are blunted by the entertainment value. Let us not confuse the loyal Japanese Americans with their representation in this film as evildoers. Loyal Japanese-Americans and the Second World War's evil empire in Japan are not synonymous. 2 out of 10
