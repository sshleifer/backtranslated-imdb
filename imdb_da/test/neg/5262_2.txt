This movie has a really weird mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It doesn't really pull it out - it should have attached to a genre. The best thing to say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the movie, when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop off at a hunting lodge / motel. I'm not quite sure what the point in this sequence is - it just works well in the extreme. The hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy guy. For some reason, Moses starts a conversation with Charlie about porn, jacking off, gay sex, sex in a threesome ... Charlie's picture of his "wife" seems to be Charlie dressed in a row. There is no reason for this really young dialogue and scene. Yet the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment a naked Moses ends up with Carter's gun up in his ass and Charlie sees them through the window. The whole series of school music humor about homosexuality - horrified and titled all at the same time - which I don't find fun at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who always races about Adam Sandler movies. This is the first thing I've seen - after this I'm not sure I want to see more. <br /> <br /> BTW, it's my husband's account - he has seen Happy Gilmore, and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler another chance.
