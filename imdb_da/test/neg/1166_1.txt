When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers made Ed Gein the Ezra Cobb, although the resulting film was actually close to the facts of the infamous case. I suppose it was probably fictionalized that they thought they should change names and the like. "Ed Gein - The Butcher Of Plainfield" masks as a true story of the Gein case, but actually bears little resemblance to the story. As a biopic-type movie, it's a travesty. If there is ever a need for a movie that changes names, it is one, far more than "abandoned". It's so close to the true crime story that "Dirty Harry" was to the true story of Zodiac kittens. <br /> <br /> So is the irritation aside, how is it like a horror movie? Well, like a horror movie, yes, like a movie in general, it's pretty awful. One of the worst movies I've been through for months. Problems run like this: 1) Kane Hodder is quite astonishingly mistaken as Ed Gein. Completely inappropriate in that part, Hodder just hangs through glowing menacingly. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the casting is rather "amateur drama" and completely unworking. It is painful to see that some lines are being delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional stylish film production effort seems to come from "The Big Book Of Moody Cinematography Clich√©". You've seen it all before, better executed. Apart from the action in style, the rest of the film production is largely inappropriate: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are long-lasting pointless shots that keep pace back ... which leads me to <br /> <br /> 4) It seems to go on forever forever. It is under 90 minutes in length, but sitting through it is an ordeal. You would swear it ran two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein seems almost secondary. For the most part, the film is concerned about family affairs for a newly promoted deputy sheriff. The next one is played by a creepy actor whose shoulders have no film to rest. Is there anything good about it? Well, Gore FX is very good. Some convincing wounds are on display and make-up is generally excellent. However, none of this constitutes the massive mistake of the film. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even have any kitsch value, it's just bad; not pleasantly bad, not "so bad, it's good", just really bad. A movie to avoid and despise.
