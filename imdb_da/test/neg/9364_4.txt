The evening's film was The Legend of the Suram Fortress and during 87 minutes of playtime it quickly managed to jump into my top five hardest movies all the time. It's hard to see; movie so different to everything else that you see something completely foreign. A short synopsis would be: A group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from intruders, but every time they are about to get started with it, there is no clear reason for it to collapse. So they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay, they must find a youth, a tall blond blue eye boy to be buried in one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that construction work is carried out smoothly. And of course, in the closed moments, he is happy to be smeared in cement and eggs, giggling as he is buried alive with only his mother grieving. It's actually a pretty simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, who works in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not too long after leaving a fifteen year prison period, does not follow any of the filmmaking rules we are used to. There are very few close-ups. Very often, the action we must follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape image that is extraordinarily easy to miss. There are very few close-ups and sometimes it is difficult to tell who does what to whom and why. Occasionally, the movie goes on digressions which have no bearing on the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer. The music is completely sour, with found sounds, on screen instruments and church group apparently fell randomly. At times, when nothing happens, a jig occurs that almost plays time until the next scene comes together. But scary, there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all, so you are forced to try to understand the message, whatever it is. One of the times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you see.
