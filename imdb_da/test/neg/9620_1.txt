I watched this movie as it premiered in LA. I think I laughed 2 or 3 times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous / badly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is actually the only saving grace in the movie. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, which I usually find entertaining. If you enjoy watching your friend's crazy homemade short film that they shot on their mother's 8mm video camera, then there's a little chance you can enjoy this movie. So again, part of what makes these movies enjoyable is that it is your friends who play every part. You do not know these people, so you will probably find it as boring and silly as I did. Dear Mr. Nelson, going back to the film school, a trainee for a while as a PA or a grip or a low job so you can see how things are being done right in the movies. So watch as long as you need to find a director of photography who knows what stop is, make sure he has ND filter at hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
