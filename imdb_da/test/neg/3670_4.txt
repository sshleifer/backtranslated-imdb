The casting (and direction) of the Undercurrent is more incomplete than inspired by this noir clunker, which does not disappear from the start to get out of the ground. Robert Taylor's wooden style is almost an instant stretch for the heavily hit Kate Hepburn, and that's the bad chemistry from the start. Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls for the beautiful aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes to the altar with him. She soon finds out there is a lot she doesn't know about him. As Alan gets farther away, she goes further into the creepy past, and Ann soon finds that she lives a nightmare instead of the American dream. Subcurrent is similar to a pair of Hitchcock plots, but Vincent Minnelli quickly states that he is not the master of excitement. Hepburn is not shrinking violet, and she is a tough seller for a character more suited to the reticent styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never succeeds in causing Kate to defer desperately to Taylor's limited actor abilities. Her attempts come across as silent Gish, while Taylor's wide descent into madness tackles Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes miscasting as the sensitive brother. Talk about chopping. <br /> <br /> Cinematographer Karl Freund provides some highly stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and cast utilize the atmosphere wisely and the excitement remains lukewarm. With Minnelli far from his forte (musicals) and Hepburn's sacrifice role to suit a bad suit, Undercurrent kills everyone involved.
