This is the biggest problem with this movie, along with quite a few québecois' greatest films: Performed in a pretentious way by pretentious people. It is really sad, but "great shot" filmmakers (driving Dodge Stratus ...) from this province believe they are right, they know what the little people like. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province every time a big movie like this (30 million? !!?) is made, it cuts off a lot of others who can't see their movie made because of lack of state aid. So it creates mediocrity; Only movies from "family friends" should be made. <br /> <br /> I sound sour and I am. I went to see Nouvelle-France expecting a journey in the life of my ancestors, but I was stuck in a weak disagreement: French accent (we must please our cousins ​​so our québecois' language) and lack of historical research are only few. Add a campy love story and the same music score over and over again and stupid québecois' viewer opens up and asks for more. I am glad that this pretentious piece of s *** did not as planned by Dodge Stratus Big Shots ... It will help filmmakers who are not in Québec's very detained "movie business". <Br /> <br /> Rent Cruising Bar instead and get a great time. <br /> <br /> PS: I will never forgive them for destroying such a great title.
