This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb, to write some kind of review, and as it often happens, it's not because of a really great movie, but a really horrible one. <br /> <br /> Take the narrative style that the youngest can relate to the Max Payne video game series, a casting of virtually unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself), bad dialogues, some dark scenes, But not many, and make a movie of it. Don't worry about the bad action, the length (too long), the lack of immersion (the protagonist must be one of the not-interesting I've seen for a long time - couldn't fit less if he died) or they often ridiculous solutions they find on certain issues, the protagonist leads in. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here, giving it 10 stars. I gave it four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I want to see it again, but the only thing that thinks about it, takes me dangerously close to killing myself. Oh, and a so-called noir movie is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The final song sounds like it was more suited to a Western movie. It's not romance, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. It would be my review if it wasn't for at least 10 lines.
