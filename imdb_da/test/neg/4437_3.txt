The best thing I can say about the "Quintet" is that it is not as bad as I remembered it was at my first impression. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This weird sci-fi thriller isn't quite like any other movie I've ever seen, as I guess, at least gives it a newsletter stamp. But it is a borderline disaster of a movie and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made. On the DVD's special feature of producing "Quintet", it is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell movie should be. <br /> <br /> It is in a distant future when the world is seized by another ice age. The movie was shot at the abandoned place in the Montreal Expo '67 and I have to admit that this gives the film some interesting production design elements, although much of it seems to be filmed in an ice-cold shopping mall. Paul Newman looks out and is completely uninterested in anything going on around him, and Brigitte Fossey, playing drifters wandering into this futuristic city looking for Newman's brother. Soon, Newman comes into a deadly game "Quintet", which all the bored inhabitants play for lack of something better to do and whose rules are never clear to the public. All we know is that the purpose of the game is to kill everyone else you play with and remain the only one who lives. This gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only excitement, because as one of them says at some point in a psychobabic soliloquy, it is only by being near death that one can appreciate being alive. The movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch because of its relentless gloom. It's almost as if Altman deliberately set out to make a movie that no one would want to sit through. There are no signs - oh yes, actors go around talking lines, but none of the lines really matter, and the impressive list of international players Altman gathered for this registry is nothing. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance that could possibly be found in a movie like this. But it still manages to create an atmosphere, though that atmosphere is one of sheer horror, and it is strangely fascinating to see fascinating looking at a man slowly starving himself to death. <br /> <br /> Almost a decade of amazing movies, Altman hit a dry spell. The "Quintet" followed closely the vicious "A wedding" heels and was followed in short order by the not bad, but mostly forgettable "A Perfect Couple", the overwhelmingly horrible "Health" (which I have never seen because it is not is available everywhere to see) and the disastrous "Popeye." God God thanked him again. <br /> <br /> Degree: D-
