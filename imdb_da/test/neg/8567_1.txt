The movie is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it is too scary ... not even close to the threshold of scary ... It's just another case of "another teenage horror movie" - but one and you've seen them all. First couple of minutes in the movie and you know what will happen next time. The worst part is, the script is blunt than the latest installment of scary movies. Would have been better if it is written in Spanish. And don't let me get started with internal jokes and punchlines. <br /> <br /> Although I will give some credit for the special effects. But believe me, just like any other Hollywood scary movie, CGI and special effects have little or no effect on a horror movie's ability to scare. In fact, it makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Between the fresh face of Anita Briem and the creepy location, there is not much to see in this movie.
