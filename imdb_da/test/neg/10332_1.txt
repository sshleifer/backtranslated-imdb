I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only joy I got from this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background "car sound" sound disappears only under the stage with Danny and Dog in the dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (eg repetitions with slow motion machine guns many times). Sandra Bullock essentially plays a part, totally unnecessary for the plot. To say that this movie actually has a plot, does more justice to the writing than it deserves. The antique computer hardware is a bit interesting. This movie was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the IMDb database indicates), and then the current "high tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Perhaps the PC was the real star of the movie. It was at least interesting. <br /> <br /> We got this on DVD for a few bucks in copenhagen at WalMart. As the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!
