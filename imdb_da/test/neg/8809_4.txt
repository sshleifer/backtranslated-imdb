Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I saw this with a bunch of friends (and though it may not be the best way to watch a horror movie ...) and most of the dialogue and action was ridiculous. It left me yearning for a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of excitement in the movie. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes that remove any visible voltage. <br /> <br /> And the ratio of twists? Yes, they suck. I don't want to say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the movie / storyline. <br /> <br /> (In relation, I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. Mediocre at best, maybe not even that.
