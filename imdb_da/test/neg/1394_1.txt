Yup, it's real people, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television history. If you want to see a sad, lonely and spooky hacker try to entertain the masses with half an hour of faded and tired social ramblings, as your mildly delayed cousin commented on the Thanksgiving table, then it may be the show for you. This is billed as edgy comedy my friends, but to be honest it makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you're a masochist.
