Basic Summary: Ipswitch used to be a witch community and escaped the Salem witch hunter by forming a duty of secrecy. The first-born men who originate from these families have supernatural powers and must abide by the seductive, addictive nature of using these forces. I usually give the movie the benefits of doubt and start from a 5, from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 too much overt sound without synchronization, +1 for nicely performed special effects, darklen actually gave me chills, +0.5 for beautiful coloring the stupid blue), -0.5 for the stupid soundtrack, +0.5 for the opening sequence - I am a sucker for stylishly composed and flashy title design. History / script: +1 for decent head page, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 not to explain some plot threads very well (spiders, darkening), -1 for boring, predictable ending, -1 for gratuitous exhibition, both as words on the screen and as bland monologuing. Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for poor bad acting, although it gets a little better when the movie progresses, -1 for lac k of character development, especially among all females <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for gratuitous male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for no sex scenes, which for this genre is usually made very bad and end up being boring over hot, +1 to hit his target audience, teen sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, although this movie is not exclusively one of these genres. Conclusion: This is not a "movie", this is a movie. There is really nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) pure fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of boys are fighting in style with DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or thoughtlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, exquisitely produced movie masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Using my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.
