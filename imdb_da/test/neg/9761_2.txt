Do not take in because the condition of this film is good. It's, but it doesn't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a reputable script and masterful direction. Unfortunately, this poorly executed movie has neither. Leconte, a good director of other genres, does not deliver in his comic farces (Les Bronzes series is another example). The comic timing is horrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other films. Others just sit there as if they gave you time to laugh. The plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and does not develop or envelop the viewer. It's not fun, and it's not credible for a second. Compare this with any comedy by Billy Wilder (some as it is hot, a foreign afair, etc.) or by Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a genuine GENIUS in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde etc.) And you will see the difference in their tight scripts, amazing comedic plays and timing with every joke leading to the next. Seeing Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign of a comedy.
