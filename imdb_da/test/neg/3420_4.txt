Recap: Not quite familiar with the Shakespeare story of Macbeth, but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original that is only set in the present. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valued hitman and in favor of leader Duncan. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than that, and are planning the murder of Duncan and any competition from the throne. This is a story of treason and cold, brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comments: Very interesting idea I have to say. To use the story but change the setting to present the time, but still keep the original dialogue (?). It puts a great contrast between the classic poetic work and the violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it's a promise it keeps, but not in the imagined I imagined. It's very bloody, but the violence is slow. Not only figuratively speaking, it is calculated, which it is, but also literally. A lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion, and that's what brings the movie to the knees. <br /> <br /> What might have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and the poetic dialogue and the extreme violence, is now becoming quite different. Now, both moves slow down painfully, so much so that it actually becomes boring and boring at times. Also I can't figure out the context, the three witches work inside. Set for presenting time and reality, I expect such magical witchcraft did not have room in the film. Apparently, it seems, but for me it works out of place. Not a partial plot, but a complete sub-story with its own rules, quite different from the rest of the film. Seems completely out of place. It must probably have been possible to convert that part to something modern. Drug-induced hallucinations might (as I suppose the director suggests, but then he has left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clear next to the story, and I just waited for the real movie again. <br /> <br /> A definite disappointment, but perhaps something for Shakespeare buffs? <br /> <br /> 4/10
