This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempt to parody different sports films is half-baked and not at all fun. Even things that need to be fun - just like the female kicker from India, who always has a traditional dress over her uniform - is not really fun. The fact that the football team is studying and getting good grades that make the trainer crazy, did not get any laughs either. <br /> <br /> The reason for having a traditional loser gets a chance by coaching a loser in high school teams having real potential as a spoof. It is a classic and sporty theme. But akas, the manuscript was too weak for ALL cast to pull it off. And this throw is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is free use of women in bikinis and underwear, so that's not all bad from that aspect. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, this is not.
