Two years after this short, the last "Our Gang" card was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted much longer. The quality of "Our Gang" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this brief is a perfect example. Gags are all very unfunny and Froggy's last line of this is the happiest day of his life, painting a bad picture in your mind about how it is for him the rest of the time. A very bad example of film production.
