I was not very excited to see this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to watch it on opening night. I want to get up and go out and try to get my money back 20 minutes in this movie. I felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many aspects, including "gaming". I tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie when I watched one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was frightening than this movie. The sad attempt to draw in a gothic girl, a overtime businessman and a 15-year-old geek, and a random guy in a video game that kills you, is a bad plot to begin with. Then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene, where the protagonist kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. The theater was packed when the movie started, and then just over half of the people left before it was over. If you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... prepare yourself to feel cheated.
