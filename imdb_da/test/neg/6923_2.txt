Writer / Director Brian Burns has, of course, seen a couple of romantic comedies, and he seems to think he has discovered the formula of success: lots of place-shot in New York (preferably in the winter), appealing to old Hollywood movies (especially musicals) fun musical soundtrack. Unfortunately, all this is just compensation for Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many authors-directors who produce independent films is not why they cannot continue with major studies but how they get some support for their films.) Usually, our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the protagonists, But the couple in this movie simply have no appeal. This is not to blame for either David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are only poorly written. What we respond to in such classics as When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or older films like his girl Friday are the hallmarks and shortcomings of the protagonists' personalities. Missing the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us a post-school specially inspired by Men from Mars, Women are from Venus. How can anyone see Burns as the successor to Woody Allen's beyond me. I didn't even laugh during this movie and the screen is full of echo chamber dialogue ("I want to paint the city red." "You want to paint the city red?"), Which is the most telling sign of someone who has nothing to write to live. In one of the early scenes, we see Krumholz's actress girlfriend recording a thoughtless television sitcom. It is the only moment in the whole movie that the dialogue feels right; Perhaps that shows what Burn's talents are great for.
