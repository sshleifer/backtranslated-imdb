The title of this review about how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine which audience would be for this thing, if not for the hard-hitting fan of the 1980s, slasher movies that simply have to see - everything from that era. Otherwise, you won't even waste your time on this. The story resembles most movies of its type: something terrible happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. Been there done that. The truth is told that none of these 80's slashers were known for their originality, so I can't see the point of harping on the movie simply for this. <br /> <br /> But where the movie fails is in its excitement and murder sequences. I've seen some scary horasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. This just fails to create any real excitement. The director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional instructions here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not afraid. Gore is also pretty tame, so anyone who looks at these things for the purpose of seeing some beautiful 1980's makeup effects, is sadly disappointed. The movie is able to slacken a bit together. Honestly, the key component for almost every slasher is the tight pacing - you have to keep things moving fast and keep the murder set of pieces staged at regular intervals, let's see, we don't see these things on the big characterization and the star's plot. But pacing, whether it's the script or the editor, is completely out. The murders are separated at odd intervals leaving us with some long-lasting scenes (no doubt intended to build "character") that only serves to drill you and let you ask for the next kill (as I have said, usually not everything is done so good anyway). <br /> <br /> As far as the killer is concerned, don't expect something original or even extremely scary. He (or she?) Carries a jogging suit, a fence mask, and his (or her) primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just dared to believe he came up with an original "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just comes out as impractical and stupid. Nor is there much emphasis on the film's "whodunnit" character, as if they either forgot or did not usually place some red herring in the mix to throw us away. <br /> <br /> I have sensed that the people behind this were trying to do something decent and respectable, and at times it turns out that their intentions were probably more genuine in making a quality movie as opposed to countless others knockoff slashers from the era. But unfortunately, the experiment fails for the most part. However, there are some pretty good plays (at least for this type of movie). There are attempts at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything at last, so ... it's a waste. Here's everything you can do to mash down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough. In the end, if you really are in these old '80s slashers, in every way, check it out if you only say you've seen it. There is a complete in all of us. But don't expect to be blown away or something. What we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that doesn't give any real impression at all.
