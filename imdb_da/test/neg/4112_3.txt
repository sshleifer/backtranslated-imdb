I begin by admitting that I enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site. I find that if I can see what the creators were trying to do, I can appreciate their work. The Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see which angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story. At large, they tried to create an entertaining movie. The reason was preferred, but most of the action movie plots are. Ed Burns does not know how to wear a rifle, but still has his own good as an action fight as he is not asked too much. The biggest problem! Destroying the entire movie, is the awful CGI. It is totally unacceptable for the animals and backgrounds to look soooooo very fake. Apart from that, the animal's ideas could have been really good, just as the action scene could fail because production failed. This could have been a truly memorable movie if they had just finished it. It really looks like they were going to go back and fix all the awful CGI, but ran out of money and still released it. Save your money because someone failed this movie. I give it three stars because it really could have been good, but was completely unsuccessful somewhere, I can't say enough.
