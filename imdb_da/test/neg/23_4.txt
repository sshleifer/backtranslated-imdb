When people say that children are annoying, you think my little cousins ​​can be annoying, and I said LITTLE. These kids turn 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty kids you will ever encounter (in a movie). Let's start with the blonde - Debbie - She is a girl of a girl, I think she has mini skirts, she has stupidly soft hair and a freckley red rabbit as a face. She seems so innocent. Next we have the second child - Geek - who thinks he is so cool, with his long range and his use of a muffler (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil clear smile. The next child is the quiet one you don't care about, so it's all on him. This movie twisted me on the children's intelligence and the only pleasure I got was from my cousin who was bitching on them.
