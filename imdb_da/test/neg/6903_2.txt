It was so boring! No plot at all! Basically, an emigrated version of Lion King is mixed into Animal Farm. Again, no plot at all. Terrible! Worst one and a half of my life! Oh my darling! I had to go out of the theater for a few minutes just to get some relief! Maybe I chuckled twice. All the semi-fun parts are in the previews. I hate movies like that. Yes, the movie sucks a lot. I don't know how it got such good reviews and reviews. There is no reason or history !! If you go see this movie, take a pillow or a boyfriend / girlfriend to keep you inhabited. Terrible. I don't think I've ever been to a movie and don't like it so much. It was good that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be sad if I would have paid $ 7.50 to see this crap.
