Terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through, and every aspect is terrible. Kevin Bacon's and Gary Oldman's overall talents are totally wasted, and even though they provide good performances, one wonders why they bothered. The manuscript from Mark Kasdan is a complete mess, and Martin Campbell has the narrative jump everywhere, but if you can't follow it, take it as a blessing. There are too many pointless, crazy scenes that just don't make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is also not very helpful. Although there was potential in the plot, director Campbell's approach has completely destroyed it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
