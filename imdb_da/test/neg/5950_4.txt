Just finished watching this movie. I couldn't imagine seeing this on VHS, as there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in English. Visually, the movie is pretty appealing. The few CG effects were very obvious inserts, but the prosthetics / creation effects were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which was pretty good) did a lot. Action was generally poor, although how much may be due to the director, I could not say that I had never seen any of the actors before. The exception I think was M. Gomez (Uxia). She stole all the scenes she was part of and not just because of a very beautiful face, but there was something akin to her performance that none of the others had. The script could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many Lovecraft details were entered, but I could personally have done without most of the dialogue.
