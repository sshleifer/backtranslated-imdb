After seeing Caddyshack 1, I had heard that there was a sequel and decided to look it up. The movie seemed pretty bad, and I told myself to stay away, but stupidly I gave and bought the terrible thing! All reviews and everything you've heard about Caddyshack II is true. The movie is simply worn out by ideas and the noisiest plot and jokes I've ever heard, the gopher acting the whole movie is really bad (Randy Quaid was fun though). Just stay away from This movie as much as you can is all I can really say. I'm deeply sorry to see and buy the DVD, but not sure which decision was the worse decision. Just get away as much as possible.
