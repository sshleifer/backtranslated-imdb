A multi-millionaire marries a female doctor. He hasn't worked for a day, and she's dedicated to her profession. He sees her out every day. Something has to give. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something about his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but soon gets fired when poor people need the job. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stanwyck) abandoned her practice? What is there to do? Kirk (Fonda) buys a bankruptcy hospital and the two now have to be happy to help others while spreading an existence. <br /> <br /> What's with the writing here? When she's annoyed with her husband, Dr. Hunt, "You've acted like the Gestapo." This should be a comedy. Hogwash. <br /> <br /> A very boring, boring movie. Very little is going on here.
