When I and my GF went to watch this movie, we didn't know what to expect, but she assured me it had good reviews. So I went with it. We got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while, sitting there waiting for the movie to start, no one went through the door. I was very suspicious as you usually get at least a few more people in any movie screening. The movie finally began and we sat there. After a while with very little dialogue and very "arty" kind of humorous scenes, I began to realize why we were the only ones there. It was uneven with random cuts from the main story of children in a skate park, the story is of course not sensible. The child was supposed to have committed a crime when he did not. If he did, it was not an answer to write a letter to anyone, and you should not feel guilty just because you wrote the letter he should have been punished. There was no opinion at all about this movie. I have no idea why we did not go and get our money back part of the way through the movie. I tried to give it a try I think. There was little concept for this movie, and the performance was shameful. The author and director and almost everyone else who made this movie should have understood what they were doing and stopping. It's an hour plus that I'll never ever come back. I'm sorry someone who liked this movie, but ... it's just so terrible, I really mean really really bad. Oh, at least I should never undergo it again.
