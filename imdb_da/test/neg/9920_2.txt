"James Dean Story" is introduced as "Another kind of movie," explains. "The presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible through the use of existing film material, tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of still images." The only "tape recordings of his voice" remarkable is a short recording Mr. Dean does while visiting his family in Indiana; He wanted to record family stories of his grandfather Cal Dean, fascinated because he played a similar called "Cal" in the "East of Eden". Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learned that the relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and of course had a warm relationship with his family. It is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. An amazing "screen test" / "outtake" from "East of Eden" appears from the film's end. It's a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (like Aaron Trask). Dean is at his fascinating best. If this scene was only shown here and no "East of Eden" movie was completed, this documentary would be an important, high-quality movie. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered an "East of Eden" extra. The Dean's "Traffic Safety Film" is also worth seeing. <br /> <br /> There are expected interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) going through a box of things Dean left with him and Dean's family. There was not enough from Aunt Ortense, and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice. More reading of the dean's letters would have been welcome. The Dean's unidentified author friend seemed to have a better dissertation for the film; filmmakers could have considered developing it as the main focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's direction of Martin Gabel's reading of the Stewart Stern script is horrible. What did they think? Maybe filmmakers can be forgiven because of the dean's proximity. Don't expect "James Dean Story" at all. This film is more about the dean's effect on people (both fans and filmmakers) than the man. It is very clearly an early piece of the James Dean myth-making "legend". Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved". The story refers to the dean as "he" with a godlike air. Dean's play, which seems to "know" the moment he dies, is really miserable.
