Wild Rebels are fun in a bad way, but also frustrating because of the actual good or at least useful elements of the story. It's about a racing car driver (Steve Alaimo) who gets mixed up in a group of cyclists called Satan's Angels, who hang a lot until they decide to steal a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also being recruited by the police to report back to them what the angels are up to and where to rob next time. It is not even that the film is really too 'dated', although of course it carries the significantly raw and silly music in the movie (from the band on stage in a scene to Alaimo "performs" if you could call it dragon it to the ordinary generic score). <br /> <br /> It's just because the filmmaker is no longer taking care of logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. As it was, I didn't have a big dislike for the movie, as I did with Hellcats, but it almost didn't leave me indifferent. What could come through as unpredictable comes only through stupid things like the name of Florida Town ('Citrusville' ho-ho). So it's not totally unworthy, as its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status is too late. The commentary is good on the movie, although once or twice I would almost hear what the characters on the screen said if it could have any value. Wild Rebels can be more of a good time if you have a six-pack and low expectations, but like that I wouldn't see it again.
