This is a semi-fictional memoir of an "international man" who has experienced various political upheavals over the past 30 years. I hoped this movie would give a unique insight into politics and war. I also hoped it would touch and affect. However, I was disappointed with this movie. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, with the protagonist Ricardo living in a country for 10 to 20 minutes. As might be expected, no detailed history could be deepened in such a timeframe. The excuses to move to another place were often explained in pairs. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented rocks shot in different countries.
