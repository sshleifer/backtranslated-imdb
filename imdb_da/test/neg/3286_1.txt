The actors and actors in this series are ok, but the scripts have been horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even fun. In fact, scripts often illustrate how not to be a parent. The scripts are so bad they make Homer Simpson a better father than this one. <br /> <br /> Anyone who becomes a parent if you want to see what to do with your children is the perfect guide. I think the garbage that this show gives us is without words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong lead in and better, much better scripts than what I've seen at this point. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generational, my teenager even rejected a show of this because they thought it was horrible.
