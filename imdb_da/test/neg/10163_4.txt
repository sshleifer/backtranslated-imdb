John Wayne is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved actors of all time. His career stretched over forty years, and within that time he played in films like "Angel and Badman", "The Green Berets", "Iwo Jima Sands", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska" and "The unbeaten ". <br /> <br /> The film is mentioned above, hailed as one of his best, unlike this 1934 "Randy Rides Alone" action, which has been largely forgotten when the time has passed, which is not Surprisingly, as it is nothing memorable except for the very short running time of just 53 minutes. A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for ever never really explained, arrives at a salon in the middle of the sky and finds that everyone inside has been killed. While looking around, a bag arrives and finds Randy there, and they arrest him and accuse him of being a gang member and demanding to know where the rest of his gang is. He is arrested in prison accused of the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the salon and was murdered, arrived at the prison to see Randy to clarify that he was one of the gang members (she hid in a secret room when shooting took place). Sally doesn't think Randy is a murderer and doesn't recognize him, so while the sheriff is out, she releases him the keys and Randy escapes. As he runs away from the sheriff and his pockets, Randy stumbles comfortably into the gang's shadow in a cave-responsible cave. Randy sets out to clear his name and also bring the gang to court. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you are a John Wayne fan. But at the same time, it has too many errors that are impossible to ignore. The movie is also extremely dated as you would expect; We have the horrible camera shooting that makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is horrible. The action is also not great, and Wayne's character is very wood and he, along with the rest of the casting, resembles wooden dolls that are being led by someone (in this case it is director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the helm and does a good enough job, but the story is paper thin. You can't help feeling that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the movie, when Randy just comes out of nothing in the salon and is looking to meet someone. An explanation of why Randy was there later, which turns out to be something like he is a P. I was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the city. To be honest I didn't really get myself, most of the time I hoped the movie would end. <br /> <br /> But it was said that I didn't find this movie to be horrible. I enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times. But it's really not a good movie, and it's not really worth watching or tracking. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is a boring Western with very few redeeming qualities. Can be fun, but generally it's not a good movie and is definitely one of Wayne's weak outings.
