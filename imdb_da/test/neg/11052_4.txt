Fortunately, I haven't seen this movie in a movie, big screen, just on a small video screen. I doubt I would have been able to sit through the movie in a movie theater and see all the violence that is present in the movie. After seeing the first 30 minutes I was both disappointed and curious. Disappointed by the hard-to-follow story, the barely understandable screens, the enormous aggression - I still don't know why I had shown the Daesu (protagonist) who pushed another person's teeth, his beastliness on women, he cut out his tongue. And also curious to see, what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even though the movie was not boring, I didn't get any answer to all that horror I had to see from the beginning to the end. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take a new war movie and if you want an eastern movie, there is much better titles out there. Afterwards, I take the assessment from the Cannes Film Festival with greater caution when Oldboy received much praise from the jury, it did not have much to say to me and only had 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <I'm hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
