Am I the only one who believes that the entire Forensics and Scenes of Crime community in the United States should deter this omnipotent patch in their faces. A curious policeman is first to a crime scene where her backup is so slow to respond that she has time to send the child who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. When he returns (still no senior police, SOCOs, or any other help to the lovely Jolie - it's New York, isn't it?) It's starting to rain, and she's going to work to photograph the evidence only after that she had stood in front of an Amtrak to stop the disturbing scene. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming distorted the pictures !! The fear continues: - Not in the film itself (pretty common, I'm scared), but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. This man is a very dedicated probation examiner with many years of experience who, instead of the highly trained, but invisible, local probation examiners, leaves the work to an untrained policeman, a beginner who continues to find the completely obvious traces and move them before photographing them. and contaminates each product and makes DNA profiling almost impossible. Now it was a bright idea eh? I know that one must be able to suspend disbelief to some degree, but those who say that this movie is intelligent must have completely interrupted their ability to think to find this movie credible. <br /> <br /> I have given this movie 4/10 for the amazing performance of Denzel Washington and for Miss Joly's lips, which are the only things that require my disbelief to be suspended!
