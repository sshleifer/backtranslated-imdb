Okay, here's the short of it ... This movie is full of corny dialogue, over the top actor and a wireless script. There are moments that were meant to be very dramatic, but just came out humorous because of the overworking and poorly written lines. I couldn't help laughing in moments that would be very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. Seeing the circus in its thriving was definitely a treat. <br /> <br /> There are moments coming through as well. But then nosedives just back in B-movie territory. I was tempted to stop seeing it several times. <br /> <br /> I certainly don't know how it won best picture, though. It must have been a slow year!
