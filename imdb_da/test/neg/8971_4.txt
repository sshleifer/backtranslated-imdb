This feels very stuttered and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially of the leading lady) laughs a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comics moments that help relieve boredom, and the dance is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!) the shopkeeper and the young guy who made spectacular tapestry , were special highlights. And I liked Peter Hayes' impression of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well.
