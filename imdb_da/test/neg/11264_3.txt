I watched this movie last week during the Berlin Film Festival and had medium expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier, and I was familiar with some of his previous works in French cinema. I actually enjoyed some of his previous films. -The cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I was looking forward to seeing all this talent on the screen. -I was not aware of the book on which it is based, and I had not read anything about the film beforehand, but I was told that it was a study film in Deep South (we have seen many of them earlier maybe it will be so good like the others ...) 2 hours later the end titles show: THANKS GOD, IT WAS OVER! - The reason is without understanding. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many smaller characters, and there were many useless plot arches. We didn't understand anything! - the accents My God! Tommy Lee Jones' accent is decent, but I still have nightmares from Mary Steenburgens Cajun-French Song ... - Poor casting in my opinion. I can't believe old man Tommy Lee Jones can knock the crap out of a lineback-built goon ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We hardly understand who all these signs are and what they do. There is a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - The comic trials were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably its "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were horrible. No excitement. Bad plays (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there are sci-fi stuff. No spoilers, but it gets ridiculous and annoyingly strange. I usually do not write comments on IMDb, but I thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But it's just me ...
