Don't make a mistake about, High School Bigshot is a bad movie. High School Bigshot is about a geek who plans to get rich and get the girl. But he goes about it all wrong, and of course end up at the end of the movie once with a few other people, fortunately with the girl. <br /> <br /> The morals of history are all women caring for your wealth. Also for us men, we assume that we just have to accept that we either "have it" or "we don't have it"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1, but it's over the very best movie. The play is not terribly terrible and the production values ​​are not very terrible. Over all, it's a bad movie and not worth seeing for many reasons. Of course, if you insist on torturing yourself, please see the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
