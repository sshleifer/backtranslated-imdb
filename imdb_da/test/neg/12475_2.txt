A movie by Almodovar - sends a tingle down the back every time. The capitalized print that opens the Spanish author's latest feature, instantly evokes memories of blissful nun, gentle necrophils, wisecracking transsexuals ?? And I haven't even gotten as far as infant's terrible criticism of critical early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving over a wind-swept cemetery animated by a shadow of widows feberishly scrubbing the headstone, I thought Pedro had me under his evil spell again. <br /> <br /> Once again my nostalgia had subsided, there was little to fill its place. For a director who rejoices to bring humanity to assassins and rapes, he does a very bad job of finding any emotional depth or quality of love in his women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a haughty housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's unintentional killing of her fierce husband. Fortunately, she lives in Almodovars Spain, where your friends will be happy to help sell a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails. Add the butter to Raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentric warm-hearted matriarchs. "Volver" literally means returning, and Pedro seems to recycle old material. The subplot of incest feels as if it was attached as the obligatory "taboo". Instead of commenting on or undermining the issue, as with his treatment of pedophilia in poor education, it feels forced and unconvincing between the film's chick-flick sentimentality. I suggest that Almodovar call his next movie Salir (to continue).
