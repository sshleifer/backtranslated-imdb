Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's theory of relativity, time is in the perspective of the one who sees the time. (Or I've heard) In other words, this movie feels much longer than an hour and changes. Even on the fast-forward (And you come to the fast-forward button) it runs in a place around eternity. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (this is where they buy a home video, but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into your local Wal-Mart's fright section), you won't Be surprised by the complete and complete lack of entertainment value contained. <br /> <br /> The line provision (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly horrible. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between Schlitz's cans. The camera's work is drunk father shooting holiday movie quality and while the special effects are okay, the sharpest effect is breast augmentation scars in the naked scene. The story is horrible, the sets are from a haunted Halloween set on the ADHD middle school student and again the lineage (remember this does not work more than sinking to the bottom of a pool swimmer) is distracting beyond mere words. Avoid.
