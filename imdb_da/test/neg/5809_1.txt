This movie is on a par with "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" for the biggest pieces of waste that have ever hit the silver screen. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's homosexual friends, this script would have ended where it should have: like some great movie expert toilet paper. I hate this movie, it causes me to hurt people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly I would rather see Step Up 2. The ultra sad part was when I logged into IMDb and read that you are doing the trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. This is a testament to all the retardants in our society who want to look at horrible movies that are only an hour and a half long cock, freak and grass with wild or no originality. Having seen this rating, I'd like to suggest "Tyler Perry's House of Pain" to all of you who enjoyed this movie; You will see some high quality humor there at about the same level of this abominable abomination.
