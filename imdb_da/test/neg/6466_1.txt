Ladies and gentlemen, we must present the worst of all Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it should have been "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat didn't get any real good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than fun, Doug E. Doug didn't get any good lines, even Dean Jones's como role couldn't save this movie! The only really good characters were the city's only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were only short. All in all, I would say that if you are considering watching this movie, you need to get something more intelligent like a Barney video.
