* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word that shot in mind as you watch the movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only critters movie I've seen from the four movies, but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too complicated since I hadn't seen the last two, but I thought it was a pretty good movie all the same. <br /> <br /> Critters start with a man, his son and daughter who stop on their way to a vacation (though it turns out they end up in their own home - which I have no idea what hell was going on) The girl meets with a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they hang out in a nearby forest. They meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters. He seems a little psychotic, and if I were in that situation, I wouldn't talk to him. Critics steal a ride of the girl and the boy's car and end up in their flat things. They hide in the basement and end up killing this lazy tremor. They almost kill this fat woman and the girl's father. They are hunted higher and higher up on the flat until they hide in the ceiling. Critics eat stuff in the kitchen (Spoof of gremlin's kitchen scene ???) And I can't remember (not a good thing), but I'm sure they have to go back to something / someone. Anyway they end up getting out and saving. The psychotic guy comes back, and before he kills the last two critters, he is told he can't because they are threatened so he sends them home. The end was disappointing, and I was annoyed that only the lazy guy died, as there were a few annoying signs that I personally would have turned off. It is an exciting, exciting movie that is worth watching. But if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend the Gremlins movies. Pardon!
