Many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying ... Men are standing in close groups and talking in pushed tone ... a few guys are coming in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter can see today ... soon you will know that someone in the house is dead ... The dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting next to her gives an idea to make the case easy by preparing simple roti sabji ... One of the dead person's son speaks to a person over the mobile. Daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but her daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people visit their house and therefore prefer jeans and T-shirt over salwar kameez .. Another son asks his mother to end all kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to leave the office early ... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly because of the wind, revealing the face ... Its Anupam Kher ... sudden alarm ringing and he rises up from bed ... Is it his dream or a flash back? You don't get the answer to the end of the movie ... Well, that's what comedy is to director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later, you find out that this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and thus makes everything clear that the previously described was a dream. Is it a movie comedy? Well, it should belong to that category ... But it doesn't actually do that !!! There is nothing that can be distant from comedy in the movie !!! More about the director tells that no one will get justice from the police !!! so everyone should cheat cheats !!!! or forget about justice !!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is ok ... Nothing much to tell about other sectors ... Bad script destroys everything ... not even Anupam Kher's performance manages to make it at least a paisa vasole ...
