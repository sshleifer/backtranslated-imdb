I wish I could have given this a zero. Sure I admit that I also mistakenly picked this up because it was the Spielberg version. A smart marketing power will release it at this time and become prominent in the video store. But I was willing to give it a try at least - I wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I've read some of the other reviews here and have to say that I disagree with anyone who thinks some of the play was good - sorry even C. Thomas Howell stunk. None of the show was any good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Although the play was decent, the dialogue is horrible! "Ginormus" and "Dick Skinners" do not cheat it properly. <br /> <br /> Now with regard to history well - it was terribly customized and must have been edited by a 5 year old. The protagonist runs constantly in situations that are comfortable - or at least that way, because of how the movie was edited together. For example, he tries to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break, someone randomly addresses the directions to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he comes to New Hope, he just stumbles on his dying brother. Then there is the part where he has traveled away from his destination for several days, and it just happens to come across the car his wife and son went into. He went in a different direction as they were how it was car where he was? He has a black backpack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. There are parts of the movie where the characters just wake up in the morning, and then two seconds later it's night - or worse yet, dusk the next day. Nor can I forget the protagonist and preacher who falls through a house in a house for no reason - we do not find out later that a stranger landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment they go and suddenly find themselves standing under a stranger so they do not notice. What the hell are foreigners like two stories with big body and several legs - how could they miss it? There is a point where a foreigner kills a random citizen, apparently spitting a kind of junk on him - but you never see things flying it just appears on guys face. The special effects are generally awful. The whole movie is like a bad "train wreck". When we finally get to the end after this guy tries to get to DC to find his family, they just appear. No search no ask questions nothing. Just oh there you are, I'm so happy - the end. I'm sorry if my review hits a little, but this movie was so bad that I had a hard time organizing my contempt. Save yourself time and not see this creepy pile of cinematic stench. It may be the worst movie I've ever witnessed. I'd rather have got a root canal - it would have been less painful.
