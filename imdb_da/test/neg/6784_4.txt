Visually beautiful with a nice music, this movie otherwise has a pretty good quality for TV. The romance between two characters, spanning a cultural and educational division, is simply not plausible. Of course we knew from the start that our persnickety heroine would light up, win over the locals and find true love, but it makes it no less boring that the film had to take such quite anticipated turns. This film had a lot of promise, which makes it a shame that the promise was unrealized. Maybe a nice under-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but I certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.
