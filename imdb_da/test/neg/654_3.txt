Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it's a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no contact with reality at all outside of soap (kind of reversed by the protagonists of "Pleasantville") and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Now it's a cute movie ... but at the same time it's also a dark, very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons to complex to tell here. Either plotline would have been enough on its own, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very devastating. I didn't enjoy it much.
