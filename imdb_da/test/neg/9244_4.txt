Korine is now established as a talented and impressive artist. Promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (although there is one particular I have not yet seen in promotional material: a blue-clad nonn plagues a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with fierce rain pits down). The first pictures of this movie, Michael Jackson Lookalike (Diego Luna), driving a small motorcycle around a track, are strangely convincing and beautiful: Roy Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow motion. There is also a fun and fantastic order, where the same character mimics a dance without music (although a radio sits like a quiet dog beside him) in the middle of a Paris street; Corine splits in sound effects and cuts that evoke both a sense of infertility and dogged release in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely exciting; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest who will fly with some nuns and leave food to poor areas nearby. In a scene that is both light hearted and influential, Herzog has to deal with a stubborn enthusiastic local who wants to make the plane ride with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog withdraws from the man a confession: he has sinned, and his frequent adultery is the reason why his wife left him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, gets special weight after learning its improvised origins: The culprit is played by a non-actor who was in progress, when Korine and co. filmed - and his incredible ways had really given him a lasting, overwhelming guilt. <br /> <br /> The future is the movie hit-and-miss; a number of really interesting moments that add to a whimsical, confused tale. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frameworks, Mister Lonely feels like a victim of the reworking editorial space. A few scenes were cut from the film, which would otherwise have painted fuller images of certain characters due to continuity errors in the costume - a result undoubtedly due to lack of acting and Korine's tendency to improvisation. A particularly deleted scene - where Charlie Chaplin (Denis Lavant) and Madonna (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later in the movie (I won't spoil it, but that's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only half succeeded). The two strings of the narrative that are not related literally are best addressed as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (There is something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But there are not enough of the Herzog scenes to deserve their place in the film, and therefore any connection between these two allegorically connected strands is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is gradually boring. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy who, at least in the lookalike segments, suffers from having too many characters for the movie's running length, a mistake that would have been even worse whose great star names played all (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many of the image's self-contained beauty and moments of true, true connection to the soundtrack, it feels like it would be much more suitable for an art installation or photo exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of imitation it would not lose any of its power - for me it might be more impressive. The loneliness associated with iconic performativity (such as that which has come across both the icons themselves and those who strive to be like them) is recorded in images as what "Marilyn Monroe" (a beautiful Samantha Morton) seduces The camera with a Seven Year Itch is in the middle of a forest or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles, after dancing, with the back of the camera overlooking an incredibly quiet lake. As are moments like these and all those where the title is randomly selected Michael Jackson songs crawl around the stage, are married to each other in a movie story that is much less influenced than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith under the scene of the singing, then on. You know which scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, like a kind of gimmicky attempt at it new film language that Korine has previously been acclaimed for.)
