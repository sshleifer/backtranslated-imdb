This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo play, but in my humble opinion, a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the characters of the characters to a start. He seems to make Miranda insane after stuck on the island for so long, Prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part. I couldn't imagine Shakespeare thinking that his characters were like Jarman portraying them. <br /> <br /> Caliban's appearance is perhaps the only thing he got right, but then again, I was under the impression that Caliban was a troubled, deformed monster, but turned out to be a crazy wandering, northerly, like the whole time lumps, not as I would have imagined him. Ferdinand makes a short look, the most naked and quiet. <br /> <br /> In fact, until I stopped seeing this terrible fit, they had been so many lines cut from the game. If anything, I think Jarman was trying to write Shakespeare again and include his own scenes most of the time. So much text has been cut out in the first part, it does not make a Shakespeare game, but a burden on the melodramatic, packaged waste of the 70s. <br /> <br /> An attempt to interpret this game more realistically in the end, but this game was never a realistic one and nothing was done as the text proves to be.
