After missing out on these countless times at TCM UK, I decided to check it out in view of its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree: I knew I would be in a thoroughly stupid trip - but it was also amazingly bad ! In any case, perhaps appropriately considering the signs involved, the manuscript changes many sci-fi titles of recent vintage - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the same sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The reason is simple, but not as interesting: From the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet, where all this takes place - so our ragtags buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves that steal ice blocks from the tyrannical temples (!) rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the deposed king; By the way, the casting includes another famous offspring: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate band - luckily the actor's mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an Oscar (under her father's guidance, not less) for PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as "Supreme Commander", the filmmakers chose to have their own screen explanation - 78-year-old John Carradine (who is seen attached to some kind of operating table during his one short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: Alien uses the toilet; kastreringsmaskinen; the clumsy antics (including the karate-style battle!) of the inevitable robot comrades; the adhesive slave / eunuch make-up is worn at some point by the heroes; the recurring attacks of "space herpies" (whatever it is); The Climax, where the characters are made as they go through a time chain (Crosby becomes pregnant, is born and sees his son grow up in 30 seconds, while the leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford's stalwart Hank Worden for this scene! ) - On the other hand, the jumpers adopted here (the intention to denote the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful but just annoying.
