Sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series to be quite engaging. So much so that I invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. It's in mind almost ten years after the first release of DKC 1. The graphics were groundbreaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought myself and my boyfriend dozens of entertainment hours. True, the second game was better than the first, and the third was perhaps missing the 'edge' in the second installment. But all three offered different games and I enjoy them for this day. By the way, I'm old enough to remember as there were no video games at all (and TVs were black and white!).
