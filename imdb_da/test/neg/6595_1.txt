This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the real family and other depicted characters have lawyers who claim hell out of VH1 for that depiction. The play is terrible, the writing is worse, and the portrayal of characters is scary. It should be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad play. I usually like Flex Alexander's play, but this time he has completely missed the mark. <br /> <br /> You could argue that he took this role for a couple of laughs himself because it was so terrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT SELECT THIS. But if you're in for some laughs about bad acting and stupid writing, tune in. Apart from that, don't waste your time.
