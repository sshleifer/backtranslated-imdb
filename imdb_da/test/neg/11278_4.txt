For this movie, based on a TV show and a serious final. I thought it was a miserable way to end a serious one. "M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, Goodbye, and Amen" was pretty good, but not this. I was a loyal fan of the Even Stevens show, but the plot was too gimmicky and Dave Coulier, man, that guy doesn't have 'I've done anything good ... good ever. They shouldn't have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good at the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give it a 4.5 / 10
