While the premise of the movie was unique and exciting after seeing the first 5 minutes of the movie, I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She gets some interesting comments and responses from her topics, but not really enough to add to the movie's validity. I also felt she was a little overboard with many things. If a guy said a dirty comment, grabbed her or made something disgusting to her, I'd say go to it, bring him down, he's a pig. What disrupted myself is that she would walk around revealing clothes and being surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I think she forgot to be attracted to other people as part of human sexuality and much of who we all are. Guys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women will look at men when they have a tight tank or no shirt at all. <br /> <br /> Some women must hate me for this, but I hope not. I have great respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was in the middle of my family for years, but I don't really feel that it did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker himself said, some women were offended by their project.
