This movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. It can be enjoyed by anyone who believes it would be fun to see his mother in a crowded disco full of people half of his age "invent" something ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be "hip" (in parlance of that age). To see Ingrid Bergman stoop for such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to see. I was embarrassed by it. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the music in the disco was not at all realistic - it is the false idea of ​​some Hollywood instructors about what pop music was like at that time. It is always a general shame in most films in the era - ersatz music is canned and carries only a painful and accompanying resemblance to the music that was popular in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Mathau is hopelessly mistaken as a kind of ladies man; he looks just lecherously grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is just too stupid. The beautiful neighbor in her apartment is depicted too seriously and seriously. He seems like a Brady kid lost in this farce. Painful, pitiful mess.
