Oh sex lives on the potato men, what wicked demon did you create? This is a movie you see, smirk a little over time and so when you mention it to others who have seen it, you just can't help but smile while you talk. But it's not that the Sex Life of the Potato Men is actually a fun movie and one that inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, it's just that the movie is so bizarre; is so insulting and is not shameless in his attempt to cross a gentle laugh at dealing with sex and sex life in general, that you just can't help but get your mouth out in a laugh. Keep in mind that what follows after the ointment is a sight on the head; a subsequent shake of the head and a raising of the index finger and thumb of both eyebrows when you gently rub them in an attempt to remind your time of seeing this trash. But that's what the movie is, it's trash can; It is very brave and shameless waste, but the trash can be no less. The one who came up with this idea put it on paper and spread it that the industry is trying to get it made, must either be very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a movie that is absolutely 'about' something, but one that does not have a decisive narrative under any circumstances. This follows from the idea that most of European film is artistic, and its stories are ambiguous and open and themes take precedence over most other things. In the sex life of the potato men, the same situation and technically plays the same joke over and over again, and it is an ideation consisting of: 'sex is a very, very fun thing'. These ideas may be more suitable for an American movie, so it is no wonder that things are starting to feel a little out of time after a while. The movie begins and ends in the same way, creating a sense of a circular journey a tour that has gone nowhere, and absolutely nothing has been achieved. Three blokes sit around a table talking and what not. Their boss joins them, and the conversation is limited to whatever raw and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios each can think of. The unequal thing here is that when a man says something ugly, the other grimaces but has an equally dirty story to give in return a contradiction in what these men find crossing the line and what they do not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined Tolly (Coleman) when the movie looks appropriate to throw in a third face to crack some more unpleasant sex jokes or destroy some peculiar stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but problems where the film is more concerned about exploiting for the sake of humor rather than studying. <br /> <br /> So what is the situation in the Sexlife of the potato men? The three to four men are in a crisis, and in the length of the movie we will adopt the role of the unfortunate fly on the wall as we witness which foul game these people face in a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then Jeremy is just scary. It all starts pretty innocently, and it seems that there is a woman he likes, and the one who likewise likes him in return, but when the essence like Jeremy is just a stalker creeps in, that's when the jaws fall. The character of Jeremy is used and laid out in a way that makes pristine love and stalking in general, just look 'fun'. Jeremy is sitting in his apartment listening to classical music and writing off letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing a kind of psychotic persona more connected to Hannibal Lecter, writing his letter to Clarice in 2001's Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we may have for him at this time, it is made completely false when it later reveals the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly, we feel like an audience that we have been pampered by feeling a miserable past, and whatever he did did what he did in the first place, just seems wrong and unpleasant. To say what it was, would ruin so few surprises in the movie. Sadly, how does he write in one of Jeremy's letters about something that exclaims to have "No artistic vision?" Just a big mess. I hate it when words spoken by the characters echo that movie they are in. Sex life of the potato men does not explore others' psyche or particular interest in a fetish, or why they feel they have to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to chop ridiculously scary jokes and situations. Rather than taking group sex and exploring what drives a person to find it, it makes a stupid joke out of it (tickets with numbers!!); rather than getting into the idea of ​​a fan of sadomasochism, the film has someone hanging from a basement ceiling and warns everyone about 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climates. Ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera falls to the next scene without much of a fuss. It's a relief that the movie didn't get any audience in This is part of the British culture, in fact, of the British mentality that I pray will be limited to our shores and ignored accordingly.
