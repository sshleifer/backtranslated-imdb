This is a crummy movie, a pretender for a genre of surprising ending movies. And a genre that has been made so much better before. The plot suffers from a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so odd, they are almost unavailable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is completely miscast here and is stiff and maneuverable. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialogue is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my merchant list. Yes, it is so bad that it goes from misogynist to just gross, as in besides frat-house gross. With so much real talent out there, I'm really surprised that this movie has ever been made. It shows the overall lack of imagination of the office suits ...
