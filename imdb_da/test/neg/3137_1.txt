Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic says Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? What is beautiful about filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera, if you can't do it in style and capture the mood of the environments. Karim Hussain certainly can't. I've seen children make better footage than Karim does in Subconscius Cruelty. But that's not the worst part. The worst thing is the whole recording, I refuse to call this a movie, is just a bad excuse to show nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, piss, cannibalism, child murder and much more. I love gore / splatter and I love horror. This is not one of them. This is totally crap, and if my comments only make a single person jump over Subconscius Cruelty, it's worth it. Always remember that your life doesn't last forever, don't save two hours of precious time at Subconscius Cruelty. You have been warned.
