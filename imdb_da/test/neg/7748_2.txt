This film had a very coherent plot and very matured attitude that I honestly couldn't follow, which is surprising considering that the play and dialogue could only have been a product of a nursery's writing. If you like Kathy Ireland then you might want to see it here. The movie was probably made as a means of trying to get her into Hollywood, but if that was her goal, I'd have to say I hope she didn't invest too much money in her production.
