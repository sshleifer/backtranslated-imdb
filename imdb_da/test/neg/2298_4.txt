You know, I really have a problem with movie lists. I read Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 best B movies from time to time, and of course I know to go through and see them all and write reviews of them all. That's why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. in the video store the other day and recognized it from Maxim's list of the 50 biggest B movies, and I decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a B movie list so I already knew it was going to suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of movie it is, I can't say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, as it is no more than a late 70's T&A movie, and it never pretends to be anything else. The only place where it extends widely from its goal is in a spooky subplot involving a few ex-cons who have stashed many stolen money in the house that the self-proclaimed H.O.T.S. Move in because this subplot has absolutely no space in the movie. Although the rest of the movie is so good, this subplot is completely redundant and unnecessary. The story is based on a few rival sororities of the beloved FU, which exists as one of the universities that contain a total sum of sorority until the rejection forms their own to get back to the snobs of the other. This new sorority, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a sorority that is supposedly based on helping seals (seals subplot is another that doesn't really belong in the movie, and a little emphasis is placed on the importance of this name Besides having a seal running around here and there the whole movie). <br /> <br /> This sounds weird, but there was actually a scene that I was pretty impressed with in this movie. A SHOT I was impressed with, I should say. Ca. Halfway through the film, one of the girls in Pi, the rival sorority, pours alcohol into the punch, and she pours something for herself into a glass and drinks it. Strangely, what she does when she drinks the alcohol reminds me of something that Charlie Chaplin would do, which really brightened the movie. Clearly, nothing in this movie comes close to anything Chaplin has ever done, but the shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4. As a whole, the movie is exactly what you would expect to be, many people run around looking at excuses to take off their clothes (I liked how removed-one-pieces of clothing-to-each score in the football game at the end was one of SMIRLS 'ideas. Riiiiiiiiight ?? ), and not much thought is put into much of anything else. For example, there is a scene early in the movie when a pair of Pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments on an H.O.T.S. party that accidentally gets caught in an incriminating image (the girl who took the picture did not understand that she was photographing them at that time), even though the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen movies like this before, it's like Gator Bait, but without the violence and rednecks and Coffy was not far away. Even Barb Wire is much the same, just with a bigger budget and more silicon. Fortunately, Maxim's 50 B movie list contains only a few comedies, because while these cheesy teens entertain T&A movies every time as bad movies with the occasional semi-nude scene after seeing H.O.T.S. I think I've decided that I like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies. I'd rather see many terrible actors pretending to be scared than being fun.
