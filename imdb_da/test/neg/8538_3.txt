First, the editing of this movie consisted of a big mistake that I didn't understand how to miss. You see consistently that the overlying microphones bubble in and out of the movie. The first time I saw it, I just said "good, wrong" and brushed it off. After approx. The tenth time it began to be incredibly annoying and distracting fun. If you haven't seen the movie yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone. can do for some interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie. This movie started with the creation of a rather solid "ghost" story; But the plot twist at the end completely destroyed it. You begin to see the movie under the assumption that the TV commercials show that the haunted house consists of ghosts that can only be seen by children; especially small children, which makes it even more freaky, as they will not be able to effectively alert the family of the imminent danger. The opening scene did a great job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the movie. ** (SPOILER) ** The movie starts with the family being stalked and eventually killed by an "invisible" force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is started when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where "it" is just before "it" grabs her and pulls her and screams into the basement. The young boy also testifies to this supposed "invisible force," killing his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family has been killed, the boy tries to drive and hide only to be shaken away. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie began with the effects of a pretty ghost movie where the family would be stalked by an "invisible force" with their only hope of survival rests on observations of a two-year. This began to be destroyed less than halfway through the movie, as the daughter also began to see the ghosts; completely destroying the "only children who can see" the illusion of advertising and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, the movie was not "destroyed" until the plot turned at the end. Where the man who had helped the family grow the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the start of the movie. Suddenly, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill the mother, daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown, where he believes they are his family; as he killed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved issues and lets me go wtf. First, why was the family's souls caught in a house? If the director went for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach where the family, after convicted in rage, would haunt the house and kill the one coming in, why was the restrained stop after the father "caught" by his family's ghosts? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man who killed them, why did they attack the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants bloom fully in time for harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family in the beginning, the man the ghosts apparently had angry with the whole movie, lived on the property for months. During this time, why did the ghosts just joke him? <br /> <br /> This movie featured many clich√© horror movie frightening as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. But I tell you that this movie could still have pulled off okay, if not for the plot twist in the end. It's as if they just ran out of their budget and just threw something to an end. For this movie to be a success, they should be stuck with the "only children who can see them" and ended with the family either getting away or being beaten off as the family at first (would have opened the door to possible successor also).
