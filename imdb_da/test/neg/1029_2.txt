It's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show couldn't even hold a light for past cooking stories, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show hosted in television history, not since Ainsley harriott has had a horrible cooking show host i have seen, at least Harriott has some great moments and a style, this one has no style at all, she is horrible as a host, the kitchen looks awful, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad , it makes me sick. Now I enjoy dining experiences that had a cool style, but it has absolutely none of it. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
