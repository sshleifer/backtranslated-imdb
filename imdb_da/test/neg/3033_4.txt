The movie moves quite well, but acting, direction and editing make much to be desired. The characters are mostly lifted from other films and Vinnie Jones lookalike is just out of Gone for 50 seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast, the stupid dealers in Lock Stock and shoot out that leaves everyone dead. You should never really know if you should laugh or just sit there in shock. This movie had the right elements, but it is too easy to sit there as a person knitting and spitting on the small details that should have been pointed somewhere along the line, and when faith has become worn, one just gets more and more critical. It was a shame it was a brave attempt, and even though Clint Eastwood is famous for saying it will be ok for a scene, he puts in the work before he shoots and he is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and repetition for the line's delivery would have made a big difference.
