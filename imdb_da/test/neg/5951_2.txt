I totally agree that reenactments kill what else could be a good show. I admit I had seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and it was not clear at all that it was reenacted. But when I caught an episode recently, it suddenly jumped onto me BIG TIME, and I lost interest right away. Then I noticed the disclaimer at the beginning before an incident that followed. Have anyone followed the show close enough to tell me, they have actually made "acting" and rebuilding parts more artificial for that purpose, or have I just not noticed before. I'm usually pretty good at recording these things, but the latest episode was so obviously artificial, I almost talked about it. Now I have no interest whatsoever to see and have abandoned it completely. It just doesn't have any real value if it's all written and acted. And at least in the latter it seems very badly scripted and acted. The comment above that says who cares is all the reenactments I do. Without visual truth, it's just a bunch of "you know what happened, once this guy" heresay. It is information better read in a book.
