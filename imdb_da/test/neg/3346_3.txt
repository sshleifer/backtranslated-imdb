I would very much like to believe that the above quote (specifically the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, was not spoken in a bulletin board that a publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be self-reflective in a heavy-check manner. But in that case director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors about the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious in their depictions that I have to conclude that Carax is actually taking seriously here, or else having so much contempt for all, especially viewers, that he cannot be bothered to let anyone enter the joke. br /> <br /> Some autographs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do it with Ã©lan and unique personal style (eg, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach while still weaving surreal elements in the history of history (eg Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenberg's later less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws a disagreeable mess on the viewer and then kills him to find fault with it. Well here it is: pacings are irregular and chopped, especially continuity is often dispensed with; redundant characters abound (eg, Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances have been exceeded; the lighting is often poor, especially in the often discussed sex scene; Unconnected scenes are tightened into the film for no appreciable reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music played in the scattered, abandoned complex, which the protagonists retreat in the second half of the movie (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's 'Factory' in the 60s?) . Much of the landscape photography was beautiful, an obvious attempt to contrast with the ugly city settings. And right into the Middle Ages, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. Her performance was also the only one among the great characters who did not sink into the bathos. <br /> <br /> There was an earlier time when I would see such films as "Pola X" more charitable. Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment does not work. But Carax doesn't try anything new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless previous films, and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of movies later, I simply have no longer the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. At this early stage of the 21st century, one has to ask: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, there are * some * directors in France who know how to make a tough movie anymore? Rating: 3/10.
