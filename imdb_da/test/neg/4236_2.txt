This two and a half hour movie was recently shown at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) on a 10 PM show. There was a scheduled 1 AM show after that, but wondered if anyone was to stay awake to see it until 3:30. The opening scene is a man who goes into a field and it lasts four minutes of movie time. It's a scary sign of what should come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking still images, such as A close-up of female genitals appearing in an entire minute of movie time (audience volume laughing in the last 20 seconds, to say "what is the message?"). The story resembles Dostoyevsky's novel "The Karamazov Brothers", where a cretin falls in love with a woman of light morality. In one of the rare cases where the crowd laughed (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours not to see anything), there was a statement from a British tourist that he could not Seeing things clearly since the Eurostar train ran 180 miles per hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switching of units of measurement from English system to metric system to "they couldn't see things clearly since the train drove 300 miles an hour". What was great about this movie is that the quality of film shows that a lot of money has been spent on it. This was no movie kitchen 8 mm experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, fitted. But I got so little out of it. Some comments indicated the scary details such as the minutae of a dandling keychain on a door just opened. Okay, it was noticed, but what was the purpose? Some corageous people in the audience went away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: something has to happen at the end. There was never. And maybe it's about the movie. All the movies in the theater are action-packed. This will be different. Nothing is happening.
