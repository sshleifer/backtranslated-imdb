This movie is worse than Cat People, which I saw in the same week. It has all 80s style. MTV punk rockers, the real ones who are anti social, not today's PC commercial type, frat boys and a bad guy called Splater. I really like Splater, and the movie feels like the blue lighting 80's, but the rest looks like the low budget Canadian slam. I've seen so much of this while living in this great country and realize that this type of movie was made because of tax relief. Avoid at all costs.
