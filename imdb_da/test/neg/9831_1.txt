I don't know if I hate this movie as much as I did when I saw it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... it would have been a good movie. The large lineage described on the box is nothing to the descent in complete inconvenience that I watched this movie on. If you have seen HBO's Taxi Cab Confessions, it is the same, only fictional, and not even externally as interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20 minutes they drive on Encore from time to time ... it's actually worth seeing. I have never ever asked my money back for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Drilling, Drilling, Drilling. It gives a unique feature, which is this: It allows you to decide what happens to each passenger so your imagination fills the gaps. Which would be good if you actually cared for any of these people. Instead, I seemed to shout at the screen and cried as a child and asked for either the film's end or my own death. The taxi driver himself (though well played, contemplating) runs through emotions seemingly random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to race lunatic to apathetic. Sometimes it's appropriate, most of the time it's just a screen for your own sake. "Dammit, I learned all these feelings in class and I use them!" Now that I've thought about it again, I hate the movie as much as I did!
