First of all, I want to strive for a big and middle finger in the direction of the Troma DVD distribution crew, who was actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's killer on the back of the cover! Synopsis mentions only randomly who is the person responsible for the massacre on the graduation day, for Christ's sake! I don't care how terrible it is or how predictably an 80's slasher can be; Just to mention who destroyed the whole point! So, a word of advice if you also buy the Troma dual feature with "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", right? DO NOT repeat ?? turn the box around and read your back! Seeing the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything. Now, as for the actual movie ?? Oh boy! Personally, I am a fan of the biographical 'work' of Herb Freed. Well actually, I don't really know if I should admire him ?? or shame on him! All herbal films are pretty bad and amateurish, but at the same time you can see that his direction is tense and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a modern popular genre trend and tried to deposit on the typical high school plays. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims of "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same track by coach George Michaels (great name! I think Herb Freed is the fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we testify how a young girl dies dramatically on the pitch, moments after winning 30 seconds of running. The debate over whether her trainer and co-sponsored members did not push her physical limits too much is raised, but a particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill anyone he / she considers responsible for Laura's death. What a demented little movie! The scripture must be one of the most incoherent I have ever seen, with lots of red herring and subplots that go nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There is a block falsified by a football attached to a spade, others are decapitated by an absurdly large sword, and the unfortunate bastard of them all even falls to his death on a spoiled bed of spikes! Herb concentrates on the genius and the rapid pacing of the killings so much that he completely forgets the subtypes he introduced earlier in the movie! For example, Laasa's sister returns home from her military education and apparently starts an investigation into the circumstances of her death. Halfway through the film, her character hardly emerges in the movie. Also, the girls' father-in-law is referred to as a violent drunkard, but this interesting task is immediately ignored. Instead of carefully mounted voltage and misleading red herring, we serve discotheque and roller skating sequences and ?? of course ?? numerous pictures of incoherent 80's chicks stripping their peaks out. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" can count on a respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") is a strong star as the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Accused") appears briefly as a police investigator examining the growing number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very entertaining role as the school's stressed principal. The teenage beauties on guard are Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, is the presence of these two ladies enough reason to count "Graduation Day" among the most quintessential slashes in the early 80s. It's a silly movie, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!
