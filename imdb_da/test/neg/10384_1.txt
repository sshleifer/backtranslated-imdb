While looking at the BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I found scenarios and dialogues so incredibly bad that I was convinced this was going to be a comedy. A couple of choices in dialogue worthy of a stomach laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was in possession!" "Do you tell me that the devil is in my daughter?!" There are many, many more, but you must discover these yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> The story goes into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't, and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the pastor). And I haven't even got the bad play. Most notable in this area is the co-player who plays Isabelle's father. The director must just have told him to act as if he has a stick on his @ $$ because that's the general impression you get. <br /> <br /> I don't really want to steer anyone away from the BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there is entertainment value to have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense actually scary ... yes, races don't go.
