I honestly do not understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine is looking at this, and since I like sci-fi, I tried to look along, as the plot of the show was promising, but in reality it really is a very boring show. The only thing that keeps you awake during this show is the video game-like CGI effects and the complete use of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets, not like foreigners they should be. <br /> <br /> Talk about which; Muppets and make-up effects are terribly overused in this show. You have this guy who could best be described as a foreign / dwarf hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp girl, you have a floating pot mouth frog-stranger ... It just feels very unnecessary and even to The point that you feel distracted from the whole story of a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too much of a self-employed. The creators of this show addressed such a way that each episode almost feels like a completely different show. At least until the point that you see the protagonists / muppets again, it is. The whole plot of the protagonist coming back to earth is too much pushed to the background on points. The action is also pretty bad. Conclusion: If you want good sci-fi, just look elsewhere. This is not even really sci-fi at first, in my opinion, as the show is more focused on fantasy elements with all puppet theater and strange dreams going on. And if you just want to see the muppets, then I suggest you see the Muppet Show and feel happy that this abomination of a show has reached. <br /> <br /> By the way; has no dejavu with the concept of living spaceship? Ohyeah, that's right; Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of 'sci-fi' remnants. Scripts and events made for a good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show.
