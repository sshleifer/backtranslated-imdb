First of all, I think the casting and acting were excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movies here. Larry McMurtry has made Lonesome Dove, and I can't fault the original, though it probably didn't need successors. He did the skin with Paul Newman, who is one of my favorite films. Mellencamp will be a country song, but the only song I hear him sing is an old Buck Owens song. The film makes a great deal out of chicken use. Mellencamp's character has a good wife and it is completely silly of him to rely on her. The riding event in the sliding cage is quite stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of it.
