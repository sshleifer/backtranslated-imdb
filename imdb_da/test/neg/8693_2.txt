Nice attempt to bring Shakespearian languages ​​to life in a post-apocalyptic setting, but the final result is horrible. Futuristic Liverpool is not at all convincing; The budget was obviously not very large, but the production designer could have had a slightly more creative approach to the matter. Alex Cox has made some good films, for example. Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really don't know what he was thinking here. Just an opinion.
