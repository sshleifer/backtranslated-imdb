There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. To the left there are films made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle there are films that are both entertaining and artistic. To the right are films that are not so commercial but are more focused on cinema as art than cinema as product. <br /> <br /> I'm not here to say that part of the spectrum is better than anyone else, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. This is the case with Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect when I saw it announced. A few friends went and asked if I would come along. None of us knew what to expect, and in the end none of us were satisfied. Yes, there are breathtaking pictures. Yes, I am amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to search through archive films. Yes, the soundtrack is comfortable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience. The thing is, it goes so far to the right of the spectrum that I can't say anything good about the movie as a whole. It's the sermon. It is a jumble of symbolism and blatant morality. It does not say anything new or forces the viewer to explore life in a new way. It just tells things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it says). <br /> <br /> This movie is simply art for the sake of art. An attempt to say "Look at how deep and thoughtful we can be by using montage!" When a movie becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than its subject, it ceases to be a movie and simply becomes celluloid self-indulgence.
