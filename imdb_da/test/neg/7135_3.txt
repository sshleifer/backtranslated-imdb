I don't want to deny that I have enjoyed watching any Japanese horror movies, but all of them should be happy with them after you have seen the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The film follows the story of Grudge. Audrey, as her mother has requested, will get her sister back. But when she comes, something strange happens to her sister, and then her sister is killed. She will find out the truth behind the curse, and later a photographer (Eason) comes to her. On the other hand, there is also something happening to a family and three girls, but they seem to realize it too late ... In fact, I can't see the points for the three girls from the international school to be seen in the movies as they is not entirely related to the story. The reason why the woman who keeps the wrath keeps killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they are just telling the same things I saw in the horror). And Audrey's sudden appearance in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange, which I suppose is an attempt to make the story of family related. The killed scenes are definitely the mix of those in Ring and Shibuya kaidan. The action would be another bad point. Like Hong Kong, I'd really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a film teacher, I really can't find anything to support bad acting. Other actors like the father, even though he just looks in a few scenes, should also have done better. The good thing is the atmosphere in the movie, especially when I saw it in the middle of the night alone. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy something with horror movies and have seen all kinds of horror movies except this, like me, you can go to kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies of this kind, spend some time watching the Japanese version of the ring.
