I've done some research on Ed Gien and I've found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien was quiet and a lonely, nothing silly about lies like in this movie. I want to say I didn't finish this movie, but I will. I will cringe through the fact that we all, Wisconsinites, speak as if we are from Kentucy. You know the fun, but oh so sad factor in this movie, Wisconsin is not as hot as they did it to see. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just an insult to Wisconsin people who are a Wisconsite myself, but it is a complete insult to a man who turned out to be an insane, lonely man. He killed two people, and the movie couldn't even get it right. Ed didn't get the dense and personal and frightening people, he shot the two and only people he killed. So why are these movies and saying "BASED ON A TRUE STORY"? This is not based on anything other than the lies that the director came up with in his foul head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing more! <br /> <br /> OK, I would like to add to this. I finished this oh so sad movie, and I personally would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! What the hell were several pines and snow in the Ravenous, and it was supposed to be shot in the Caliphs. <br /> <br /> OK, for those who know nothing about Ed Gein, I would like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein was considered to have killed his family, but it was never proven. He killed a bartender, she was shot in the bar near no one was around. He took the dead bartender back to his house. Ten years later, he shot and killed the store consultant, he trusted the cash register and the van. He was caught because of this murder, he came the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was in there and bought the antifreeze, and the reception that only had antif ..... was the only evidence they had to start a worldwide manhunt. He robbed graves, actually robbed 56 graves. He hates the people he dug up, and he made furinture; lamp shades, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family that he ate dinner once in a while, and they threw all the meat he ever gave them when he was caught when he was caught in their house. He was arrested and hidden behind a police car, in fear of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book the judge who tried him, wrote. After this movie was over, having seen the whole horrible thing, I'm not just offended by the directors' terrible views on how Wisconsin women look. I think it was hard to tell who this guy was on the plate half the time you know because Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I'm too offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the bad job he did in this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is, and I think he can be okay in something else, but he did a terrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all, I am so sad that I wasted 3.99 on the movie. <br /> <br /> Films after finishing were completely untrue, this movie is like me saying the world is flat, and George Washington was not our first president. Come on people, that's your story, and that's Wiscon's story. To finish this rant, how would you all, if I made a movie, and George Washington resembled Brad Pitt (some of you might think it's fine, but it wouldn't be true) and he lived and was not the president and whatever . You can't rewrite the story.
