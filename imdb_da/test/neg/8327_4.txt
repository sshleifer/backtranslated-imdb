Danny Lee's show as wisecracking cop is the only place of interest for this movie, although it has an excellent cast, including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad boss who wants to settle for a life of peace and plenty, but Alex Man, a total psycho who has a great courage against CYF, will not let him go. CYF tries to escape to Malacca, but to no avail. After his family has been blown to pieces, his comrades are killed or wrapped, wounded and broke, CYF returns to Hong Kong to get into a serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It sounds much better than it is. CYF is well dressed and beautiful, looks painful, grimaces and cries, but somehow you just don't care. Andy Lau looks good, but it's about it. Carina Lau has a small, tiny little part that was nice, but she gets a ball in her head early so it ends it. Alex Man is a cartoon villain he is so over-the-top, which at times can be exciting, but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden variation enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is awesome but - too badly he is just a little blip on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie. <br /> <br /> Rent it, don't buy it. Or just jump it all over. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to "Rich and Famous", although apparently filmed at the same time; It was first released because of CYF's box office power.
