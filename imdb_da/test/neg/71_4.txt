There are many different versions of this that float around, so make sure you find one of the non-classified copies, or something else and a nudge cut may be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The clip I saw on the screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by the Shriek Show, which maintains the original US release title WITCHERY for DVD release. It is a nice print and seems to have all the footage, but has some issues with cropping / aspect ratio. In Italy, it was published as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled), and the third LA CASA was another movie by the same production company (Filmirage) best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make the case even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I just have to stop now. I start to confuse myself! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-horror horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it is not. I was actually in this movie in the first half or so, but at the end it became a pointless mess. A large, unoccupied hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting when various people are picked by one by one by a German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) wishing to capture "Witch Light" and his virgin writer (Leslie Cumming) studying witchcraft throws up at the hotel without permission. In addition, real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) is showing the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Labeling is also their children; pregnant adult daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at that time). When everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hanged) and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically beneficial for "Lady in Black". So what can you expect to find here? Lots of unpleasant! One of the signs has their lips sewn closed and is then hung up and down in the fireplace and accidentally slowly shaken off the rest of the casting. There is also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, swordfish through the head, someone being set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street recorder, the maid being raped by some demons, a lighthouse's boar and exploding thanks to voodoo dolls and some other things. Technically, it is a nice movie with pretty good filmography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel / island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (especially in the end) and Ross both look as if they are having fun, and Knef is great as the evil witch. Although people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he is also not bad in his role. <br /> <br /> On the downside, despite all the gore, the movie looks somewhat boring and it becomes monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are also confused and confusing. When characters are swept into the witches who are tortured and killed, filmmakers decided unwise to overlay the screaming actors over a silly-looking red spiral vortex effect that looks extremely cheesy. And the witch herself is free and cheaply designed with unfinished timber. And while most of the game is at least decent, some of the performances (especially the "actress" who plays Hasselhoff's boyfriend and child) are so bad that they constantly distract.
