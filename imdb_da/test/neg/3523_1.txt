By hitting the ground, the movie begins with three kills in a row. No plot, no sign, no motivation; The second murder happens on the screen and that the victim's cut off head is actually used to eradicate the third victim to the right one! This is a highlight. But the Lewises are, of course, wise enough to lead with strength; Soon they cover up on the soft dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shoot endless, snappy repartee in a nasty wide shot. At this time, the fright atmosphere of this Betacam production rapidly allows for an insurance mediation with the monumental (and rather excellent) plainness of the leaders who stifle things further in that direction. Shlub policeman examines, the meat clips are slaughtered, repeated, climbs early with a memorable wear finger-in-salad gag. Only how in the hell did the fingers get into the salad? And wasn't the blood cult's purpose to assemble the pendants they separated? When GORE stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. And without pampering the big, irreconcilable twist, just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes allows for a deep cathode-tube-crushing impulse. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and move on with your life.
