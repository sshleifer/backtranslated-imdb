This movie is not a comedy. It's not even fun in "this movie is so bad, it's fun" section. Rather, it's just pretty bad. Other reviewers mention the poor lighting, but besides it is the abundance of poor plastic surgery. Meanwhile, a lot of great-acting talent was wasted on a poor manuscript and uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It's hard to feel sympathy for any of them). It's also hard to see the four characters as close friends. It seems that just a bunch of women are thrown together and pretending to be dense. <br /> <br /> I won't list all the issues with this movie as it doesn't deserve so much from everyone's attention. (It's also not worth taking time to see it).
