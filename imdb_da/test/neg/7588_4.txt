It just happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had posts in Harry Worst's 50 worst movie book. Now I think they agree that they are among the worst movies ever, is an overstatement, although they are still both quite bad movies - especially the first one, as it showed more eye-rolling and "googly eyed looks" than I ever seen before !! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of others out there thought it made the movie "artistic and deep" - and since I am legally sensible, I must say I hated this first movie !! The other, while still very incomplete, is a major improvement, as eye scrolling is minimal, although overhead and long boring scenes are present in this movie as in Part 1! While part 2 looks rather incomplete and needs at least an hour (especially since it never comes to Ivan's crazy behavior later in life - like killing his son and heir while he is in anger). Since both 1 and 2 were ordered by Stalin to both apologize for his own murderous government and glorify him, it is not surprising that Ivan's life story is very incomplete. Even without Ivan's horrible behavior, the very evil Stalin did not seem to like the movie and would not allow his release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow it because he was more concerned people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the movie was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy like Ivan! <br /> <br /> That way, there was a segment of this boring movie that was just as cool that the movie deserves a 4 (without it, a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir on the banquet! It is well done and quite fun in a dark way. And the scene was made in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is very strange, because in the mid-1930s, a highly improved sand color was developed by Technicolor, which no longer made everything look like orangy-red and green-blue. Then, under the color sequences, this film looks much like a silent or early sound color film. Very strange for the 1940s.
