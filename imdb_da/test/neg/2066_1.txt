I don't even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth writing a review, so I'll just quote what another user posted because I agree, but I give it 1/10 instead of 2/10 "I'm at a loss to find the words to express how badly I thought this movie was. The original concept was promising, but in all respects it was horrible. We go through the main points, idea, but really awful development. There were many points when I thought "no, no one would do anything so stupid." The ending was amazingly anti-climatic. Thinking of someone who wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it - music - intrusive, inappropriate, and generally horrible. Direction - totally amateurish Camera - doubts they've heard about it. really bad, I'm totally confused, how this movie has scored so high. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not ever. "
