I'm struggling to see the point in this movie. It must be a comedy, but I didn't even laugh. The story is one that could have been interesting in a well-functioning movie, but as this is done in comics, the result is incredible (as comedies should be). The cartoon series was very hit and miss, even with the episodes, and it is fair to say that everyone involved has gone on doing bigger things. One to avoid. I also just found out that comments should be 10 lines long. The whole point in these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: don't write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young's, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you like to forward this. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes found in friends and dodgeball, enjoy watching this!
