First of all, since I'm one of those people who never saw the MST3K-chopped version of this movie, I can't comment on it. <br /> <br /> But I saw the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, and I thought it was as good as anything else on that channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offers. I have noticed in reviewing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least some things about this movie and rightly so. In the original cut, most sensible people would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five are average for me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi image. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the above, I have also noticed that the proofreaders who seem immature, boring and flip and consequently come out as bones from where I stand, are the same ones who cannot find anything good About this movie and basically waste it for no reason based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on MST3K. Or if they have seen both cuts, it seems that they were severely impaired by the MST3K display at first.
