When A Killer Calls must be the largest ripoff that has so far been released by asylum. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice that repeatedly asks her: "Have you checked the girl?" Of course, she has calls from the police (after performing some realistic unnecessary tasks - hangs up when he "rings" and waits ten seconds and calls * 57). Sounds good? Yes, that's why I rented it too. <br /> <br /> Well, it should. And I hate to say it, but it could have been more entertaining than the big screen crapfest that was released around the same time, if not for a fatal error - instead of revolving in B-movie ripoff glory, it tried to do something original. It tried to make the main character sympathetic, rather than having klichéd, camp fun with her. Remember, this could have worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Well, she looked good and she screamed and cried, though. . . oh yes anything. <br /> <br /> Then came the terrible end. Not terrifying, because it was frightening, horrifying because it was living. The pacification until that point (about an hour in) was campy, klichéd and fun. Then head it in a different direction, and it jumps away from just another silly, funny slasher movie with a sexy "teenage" cast for a Hostel-esquire gore / drill. I think it falls into "Oh yes, whatever" category. The leading actress flubbed a line? Oh yes, no, I don't want to recreate it. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh yes, no, I don't want to rewrite it. The pacing changes completely halfway through? Oh yes, no, I don't want to shave fifteen minutes away. Continuity Error? Oh yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (stupid, cheesy, predictable, campy splatter movie with sexy cast), then you'll be fine until the end. The end is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not campy or cheesy or fast paced. In fact, there were almost exactly five minutes of the sign, nothing more than being tied (and it's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at things in the room and then screaming and shouting. . . no matter what.
