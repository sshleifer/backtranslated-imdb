Awful, horrible, horrible show. The "Real World" problems were about overtly unoriginal. Stereotypes to a large extent. What the hell is going on with the African-American (black!) Guys eyebrows? Tyrone power! Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible show. The fact that it lasted three seasons begs faith. This show is really swelling for the brain's dead acceptors of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by Bell seemed almost humorous about this. Well, by greeting, no. It is of the same banal ilk and therefore just without intelligence. The only thing missing so far is that Jesus is a GOD message. The mentality and liberation are the same, but yet it feels evil and soulless. You can almost hear the TV managers sprouting buzz words on each other. In fact, I felt so annoying about this exhibition's excremental existence, I felt compelled to comment. <br /> <br /> Awful, horrible, horrible show.
