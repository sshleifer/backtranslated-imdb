I was not so impressed with this movie and found it quite tiring and ordinary. The baseline was interesting, a child created his own college and registered hundreds of children, but the laughs were few and far between. The jokes were not really fun, and I didn't bust any of the scenes. The characters were not exciting, and I did not feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat child with glasses trying to get into the frat group. It was a good first clock, but it didn't blow me away, and it wasn't one I would recommend. To compare it to other movies in the same genre, that is, the American Pie is just cruel because there is a movie that was ridiculous. This accepted failing to raise a smile!
