To start, I am easily pleased. I am by no means a real critic, and movies that authentic critics, friends, family and newspapers can find terrible can even be fun for me to see. <br /> <br /> but not this one. <br /> <br /> I got it as it was the latest wesley snipe movie in my DVD store. I like snipes, but it was a disappointment. Bad story, bad actors, continuity glitches, crappy sound, depressing places, a pseudo-cool snipe, I really had to force myself to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> They even left some markings in the shots where a car was coming to a stop. <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about "small production company / young director / low budget" kind of bad, where you might ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> A wanna-be block buster action movie that disappoints like no one else for a long time.
