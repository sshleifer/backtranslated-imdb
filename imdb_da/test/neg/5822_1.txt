Horrible direction from a terrible script. Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus. Laughable accents all over the card. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea that it was about the boys in the love of the mud, but it was immediately apparent from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn pictures of naked or gently dressed young men, normally wet or shiny sweat, looking longingly at each other.
