This movie is a real shame, not just for the plot, the characters' empty performance, it's for the lack of creativity from the director and the entire crew, it's perhaps one of the worst movies all the time, and it's hard to believe it's the sequel for one of the most famous films from the 90s. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Mask when I went to watch this movie, I expected to film with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead I saw a real bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons. The movie was not fun even for my 7-year-old sister, so I wonder: What was wrong New Line Cinema ???. Was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie, or did it try to create another masterpiece like the Lord of the Rings ??? Because if they did, they were totally out of their minds.
