Only desserts were, I must say, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The action was horrible and even the plot line was ridiculous. I gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because I enjoy laughing at creepy corny movies. My expectations weren't high at first but it turned out to be cornier than expected. I thought it might not be that bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition - The Golden Whisk - came up, I started to change my mind. It all went downhill from there. The only thing I liked about this movie, except to sneak it is absurd plot and dialogue, so their food. But there was a film about confectioners, there were minimal scenes where they actually baked something. I'd recommend seeing the cooking channel instead of this movie. You get to see more food being prepared and you avoid the pathetic one-liners. But if you enjoy corny love stories that are sometimes fun, go and see.
