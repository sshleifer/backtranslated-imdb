This movie was so horrible that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I myself was sitting through this pile of waste. I couldn't believe a movie like this was thought of. It was one of a serial killer complaining like a chicken. He does not cut just a couple of times, he looks non-stop throughout the film. He even pats his arms like a chicken, which is even more dumb than anything I've ever seen. I couldn't believe it came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early 80s or something. Then the daughter is not very smart, nor because she protects the nerd or the man's chicken. The end just gets worse and is the worse end I've ever seen. This movie is just chicken s ** t. I laugh more than I was scared and I highly recommend going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
