The Camals Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. It is certainly not. <br /> <br /> It's about a couple leading to Egypt to capture some desert smugglers. <br /> <br /> This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy that let it down a lot. It's pretty stupid in parts. Depsite this, there are some good actions and place scenes. Cast is led by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as love interest. <br /> <br /> A view is enough for this movie. All in all, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
