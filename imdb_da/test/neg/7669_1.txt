WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> I know I've seen some bad movies in my time and this makes me just as angry. This is an insult to people seeking a bad movie. The "story" involves a flight attendant who discovers his boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great Robert Wagner) is a murder, thief and just a super cute face. After Concorde starts, he sends guided missiles to destroy Concorde. So, while Concorde is running at the speed of light, our "hero" (the game of unfaithfulness, George Kennedy) opens the cockpit window, then he puts his hand out the window to shoot the missile! I'm not a rocket scientist, but it seems that his hand would at least get a wind burn. Then against the final "climax" when Concorde is heading for a disaster, and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and suggests marriage. A priest happens to be in the next row and continues to marry them as the planes collide! (I'm not up) Wow, the guy who wrote the script, must have sniffed glue for a week.
