Something not that big. "The Silence of the Lamb" remains Demme's only good movie, and of course, I include all the overstated, big-screen obsolescence exercises that I haven't seen - and never will. <br /> This is a lightweight comedy that takes a thriller, turns somewhere halfway. The first half is a little hard to sit through; nor is it fun or particularly interesting. Daniels plays an over-the-top silly-like-dirt naive moron who is so indifferent and trusting that it tolerates faith. His animated plays are often annoying and hardly fun. He actually lies to Griffith from the start and tells her he is married to children when he is actually divorced! Throughout the history of mankind and film, any man who is married and meets a woman wants to lie - if he is lying - and say he is not married. (Later, the non-credible or credible reason behind this was revealed: he would "protect himself." What a lot of shed ...) That his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the stupid things in the movie actually made me look forward to Liotta pounding at him when he hit him in the previous apartment. <br /> <br /> What then happens in Daniel's apartment is the end of the classic movie's match-to-death as the good guy - albeit the very stupid good guy - wins predictably. Still, at least the last half hour has some action, something is going on, and Daniels no longer has the opportunity to be animated. The film lacks credible characters (whether it's head or marginal), and the feel of it is for the 80s, which means that the film has a rather gentle appearance; visually ugly. Sayles once again makes a como as a police officer. The film may also be a bit too heavy on the coincidence side. Griffith once again plays a softly talking stupid-sounding bimbo, but as usual she is convincing because she is a soft-talking silly-sounding bimbo. This was a previous movie before her lip-enlargement and breast augmentation surgery; compare the natural breasts she exposes in this movie to the exploded balloons which she briefly flashes years later in "No's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" by Griffith and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email.
