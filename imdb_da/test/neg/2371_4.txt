Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour carry this film, not without a fight, as the manuscript of course rushed into old episodes. When it came out, it must have been a real disappointment, as it also happens on a ticket budget. Attempting to move it out of the house - there is barely irrevocable, a bad job all around - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match in the local gym, it simply doesn't work. Most of these are only character-light setups for a lonely not very good gag. That said, the interaction between Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone else with him) is mostly fun; they even manage to make a soda lime work, but you can see the struggle with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the plot halfway through. Don Warrington has very little to do except 'be black', and because of the random script hacks, Christopher Strauli changes character at least twice. And finally, as he often did in the TV series (although you may not remember - read scripts), Eric Chappell lets you down with a 'time's up' end. Were they so cynical or just too desperate to be in the film industry? Rossiter and de la Tour are always fun, but as a movie, it is a horrible caption for a lovingly remembered television series. REST IN PEACE.
