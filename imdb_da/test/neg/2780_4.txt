Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs who manage to come out as a kind of semi-professional movie. Unfortunately, the bad effects, wood-acting and unoriginal history make it a very mediocre horror slasher at best. In no way is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's just nothing special and has nothing in it to justify another clock or hope for a sequel. You know that a director is in doubt about their own horror movie when a) there is no meaningless nudity and b) the film is so short that they add some rather boring exits to the final credit that nobody really cares about because the movie doesn't was so good! A slightly better movie that I can't help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest, the 80s movie 'Scarecrows', which is an OK movie, but still pretty average. Dark Harvest is not as bad as some of the other comments say it is but do not think that you too are entertained much. One thing I must also comment on is the character of Angela who has a really awful English accent! What was the point? Perhaps giving it a certain touch of class? Yeah right! English people DO NOT say "WAAHTAAH" when they mean saying "water" and I don't care what part of England they are from! If you can't find a true English actress or a non-English actress who can put a brilliant English accent (not many of them on), don't BADER! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
