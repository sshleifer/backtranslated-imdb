Caddyshack II is one of the pictures that makes you ask 'Why?' As in; "Why was it funded?": "Why was it made?" and 'Why was it released to the public domain?' <br /> <br /> At least it's a bad movie. It serves little purpose, but to emphasize how superior its prequel was by putting an almost identical set of signs against each other in a similar story as a "New Money" developer trying to buy the company's golf course shrine. <br /> <br /> Right from the bat, the follow-up does 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. I mean, if you go into a very successful picture as the first, then you have a window in a few years to do it. But leaving the age of 8 means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply make a follow-up or bad imitation, as it is, so your kind is obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to whether They actually are not actual contributions of the actors who made the first so memorable. But there is little about this. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. Okay, that Ted Knight's transition in the middle years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable Judges Smails, but Robert Stack's entry as "Chandler Young" (a WASP elitist resembling the Smails character) is fanciful and lacking in anarchic frustration that made the Knight's turn so attentive. Jackie Mason's 'Jack Hartounian' is a weak attempt to recreate non stop wisecracks provided by Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) the character of the first. While Dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable Mason's is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray's ridiculously ridiculous archer 'Carl Spackler' and his farewell war with the annoying local gover is replaced by his Ghostbuster's co-star Dan Ackroyd's role as the militant 'Capt. Tom Everett 'who's highly-rated voice just splits your pages with frustration as opposed to the intended laugh. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as cousin Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is the opposite here to play Hartounians unstable lawyer. The appearance of disbelief shown by the actor's look at Quaid's character is intended to be fun acts of inappropriate violence, echoing the audience. You don't laugh. Your just asking, "What the hell is he doing?" <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase turns out, everything is occasional and wise rather fleeting in view of the disaster that is waging around him, as the pro pro Tye Webb in the movies refers only to the original who does not resist the golf course itself. With her deeply tanned skin and tall Hawaiian shirts, Chase looks as if he's just come back from a long summer vacation and needs a paycheck. He refrains from the events in the picture enough to take some of the blame and leave with some, everything is a bit, the credibility still intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter 'Kate' takes over the role of the original original 'Danny Noonan' as a teenager struggling against class sharing. Sounds ridiculous? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic from a blue collar family) and his ridiculous attempt to enter the White-Anglo-Saxon Protestant dominated world of the golf club, mover and shakers were played out to some memorable sets of pieces. such as being laid off by the resident Lutheran bishop and being deceived by the offspring of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment over her father's inability to fit in is suggested to be because of his Jewish roots. Except that it may also have to do with him is a classless moron, but such intricacy is swept aside even though I stopped caring long before they were resolved. At the end of the day, Noonan tried to move on in life. Miss Hartounians biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multi-millionaire father so she can get a date with the club's lost white child. Or I gathered. <br /> <br /> Yet in summation it is poorly written, poorly written with lame pieces and wasting a lot of talent. In fact, kudos if you were able to sit through it to its conclusion. It's really a punishment. There it is questioning why so many of the original actors did not return as opposed to being replaced by artists who at least saw paper on their equals. Maybe they just weren't asked. Or maybe I think they actually read the script. Stick to the original !!!
