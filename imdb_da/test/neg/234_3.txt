Kid was born retard. It draws in fifty directions, features dialogue and action lifted from much older and better-known flops, and it may be fun - if only the authors knew what fun is. <br /> <br /> The past few decades have made Disney stuff a lot better, but don't let it fool you. They should have given The Kid a wide berth, sang it a cradle, and then ran the train to a ravine. Pity kills.
