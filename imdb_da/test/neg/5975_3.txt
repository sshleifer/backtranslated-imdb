When providers become evangelists, they still exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching the movie is ?? God Bless me that I do not eat fish or other vegetarian products! <br /> <br /> The documentary is about Tanzania's Lake Victoria, where many varieties of lovely fish lived, and one day during the 1960s, one person came and injected the mighty fish perch, which became the exportable item to Tanzania. European and Japanese markets. The consequences were serious ?? Firstly, all local small and large fish were extinct; Secondly, the aircraft that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial / business / capitalist sense so it is full of weapons and ammunition (that is what Europe can give this world); Third, pilots (like all immigrants and travel populations as truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs by blossoming cheap local African prostitutes to them; Fourth, the brokers, dealers, middle-chain men (mainly Indian businessmen) are richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; Fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs, etc. The principle of making this documentary was excellent. But has the director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It's a big no. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: As in India, it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project to the world, Indian poverty and unpleasant things; Similarly, it requires an eastern born European documentary producer to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and devastating economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive for ignorant breeding of the rich class (who has never seen poverty or known poor) who survive, live, serve, and celebrate as pests that depend on projecting poverty into the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing but contempt of poor people in African and Indian who see such pictures of theirs. Hubert's intent and motives seem completely unilateral. The pictures, characters, locations, interviews are for grave and dark, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we feel ultimately is pity and sadness for Africans. We also begin to consider the Tanzanian government and people as malicious. Perhaps some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but that would be no more than that. <br /> <br /> The director is limited to showing himself on the screen once ?? not to be identified among the Europeans exploiting this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director Hubert can only survive being providers himself as today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have the guts or common sense to talk to all Europeans who eat or companies that import these fishery products. An all-around exciting action! But I understand the reasons for the same ?? Hubert just wanted to rake his fame, sit and smile with prizes in his European comfort. No more words to save for this pathetic effort. I hesitate to give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish poorly-conceived instructor made exclusively for the un-intelligent western audience! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
