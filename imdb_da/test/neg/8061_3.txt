One of the most notorious of the banned "Video Nasties" in the 1980s is also one of the most exaggerated. "Make Them Die Slowly" is about what you would expect from a Umberto Lenzi-directed jungle potboiler omme (inventive (yet poorly reproduced) native torture techniques, some ridiculous "social comments" (yes even more sillies than "Cannibal Holocaust "), and lots of gut gets chewed. However, the film's exploding violence is only shown in a short close-up and never lived for a long time, reducing its impact (interpreting it as you can). The dialogue is Lenzi's usual stupidity, as our male heroes show their love for women by calling them "tw @ t" and the like. Thrown by familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) do their best in light of the escalating idiocy (including a completely ridiculous "castration conservation"), but cannot save this overtime, miserable effort.
