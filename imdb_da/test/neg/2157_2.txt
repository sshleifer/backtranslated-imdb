I'm not sure what the purpose of making this movie was. It looked like it was made up of some historical communities that were to appear in your local 'Pistol Pete' museum. First, it seems that it could be the start of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is on you when there is no blow and you realize that someone took this seriously. The story was not bad, but the involvement of the SASS members seemed to be a trick (that worked) to make me see the movie. I swear, the trailer lists each character in the movie down to "dead cowboy # 5". The reason western is so funny is the atmosphere and the signs it brings. I just had the feeling that I looked at the civil war rean actors dressed up as cowboys. Not even worth the digital video it was recorded on.
