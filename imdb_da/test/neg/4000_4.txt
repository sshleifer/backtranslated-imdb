I know that many people will automatically have given this movie a rating of 1 just because it doesn't have the big budget and top-of-the-line special effects they are used to. However, I knew what I was doing when I popped it into the VCR. <br /> <br /> I don't think we get much more budget this unless we film a family reunion. The lighting is terrible, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible, and the play is extremely poor by almost everyone involved. BUT it is still a funny movie and the plot is interesting enough. It is centered around a guy named Tom Russo (Asbest Field) who has been down on his luck with his job. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work and put even more pressure on herself. As he starts to work for hours, we slowly see him go over to madness and obsession, and he becomes suspicious that his wife is cheating him and starting to brutally murder the various men (most repair favors) for whom he feels responsible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the gore effects are extremely cheap but match the overall tone of the movie. The brutal ways Tom Russo is going to murder these men give us an idea that just have sour he has become. The pacing of the film is also very good, and there is rarely a dull moment. The end does not really follow the rest of the movie's plot, as it seems to go from a psycho-slasher movie to a "Dawn of the Dead" wannabe, but it is entertaining anyway, and I have to give Tim Ritter credit for needing a unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie, but it is by no means a good movie if it makes sense. It's budget is its main stumble and the consequences are almost too much to overlook. I do NOT recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big budget movies and who cannot have an open mind for ultra-low budget films. You just don't want to enjoy it. For others and fans of gore - I say give it a shot. You will at least find something in it! <br /> <br /> My character: D
