This was a disgrace to the game FarCry, I had many expectations, but all ended with a nightmare. In addition to the bad effects of the visual effects, the plot stunts even though the humor used in the movie is an absolute flop. The movie is not worth seeing at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess she got the keys handcuffed all the time. I hope some great instructors will remake this amazing game in a movie one day. And I want to invest some good money to get the visual effects to the right and the scenarios as good as the right one. But until then, you won't waste time trying to watch this movie, for it will surely make you feel special if you're a FarCry lover.
