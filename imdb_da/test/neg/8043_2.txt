Ugh. This movie has so many incredible plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie for a fierce mess. The story is half decent, but the holes in the plot make the performance literally ridiculous. In fact, we must believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and put the President of the United States at risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the President's patrons, we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider will be a great achievement as president, but unfortunately it was offset by Patrick Muldoon's genuinely fragile act (which somehow continues to get Hollywood jobs based solely on his good looks and his spooky makeup on every occasion, no matter where if the script requires a smirk). Maybe someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise - or maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can get a movie that is badly made, maybe I can too!"
