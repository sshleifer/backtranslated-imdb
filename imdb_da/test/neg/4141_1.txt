Post 1988 after the disaster GJS Amitabh's film lost the quality they had previously <br /> <br /> Barring MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989, which was a good movie stay, all movies were craps mostly except HUM (1991) later in 1991 <br /> <br /> This is another of the crap Amitabh movie's people who were rejected in the early 90s. The film he made as a sign of friendship to Shashi Kapoor, who directed the film, and he did not take an ear The film also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired each other after RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops among them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <Ajooba two years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both came supernatural films that were rejected. This is another type of crap Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh type outfit and performs magic changes 1 person to a donkey.etc Of course 1991 you can apologize for the special effects, but the film is too bad to be seen <br /> <br / > Direction of Shashi Kapoor is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Among actors Amitabh became too old in 1991 and so tired, his plays are okay but not on par with his best Rishi is okay . Dimple is okay, rest is forgettable
