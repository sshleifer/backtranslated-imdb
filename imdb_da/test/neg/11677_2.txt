It would be pretty easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl is shot in the forehead of a North Korean spy but survives. The bullet, which is embedded in her brain, makes her long after knowledge, as well as sex. Unknown to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her bag, a key that can unlock the power to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a drum, and at least a few people will appear to the theater. I'm not sure how many people went to see this four-year movie when it opened in New York in April, but I don't really hope many. It sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art house performance and is really just incredibly boring. Many pinku movies in the past have been successful in their artistic ambitions, but this film's ambitions just make the time between the sexual scenes that are disturbing. And then the sex scenes aren't even good! I've seen some rather outrageous things in dirty Japanese movies. I have never seen this country produce anything with sex this boring. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only rewarding thing in this movie is the lead role, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise it is pure torture.
