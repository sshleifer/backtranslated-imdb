The first few minutes that showed the cold and crusty Willis character were pretty entertaining, especially with Jean Smart, but it was really thought out for it. This is just hackneyed big man and a little annoying kid stuff from the way back with no innovation at all. I know the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as annoying in his younger self, but I found this kid particularly annoying and whinney.
