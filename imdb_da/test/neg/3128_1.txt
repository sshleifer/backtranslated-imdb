This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. We would like and be rooting for an arrogant, know-it-all-trashy bank robber, played by Dale Robertson, and a coy tease played by the extraordinarily beautiful Linda Darnell in a fire engine red dress. She must have been sewn in this bodice! <br /> <br /> A senator in the movie thinks Indians and whites should try to come to an understanding, however, bigots win the day. I could hardly sit through the endless dialogue with bigotry issued from the other letters mouth. <br /> <br /> Apart from injured knees and dancing with wolves, there are few films that give a positive depiction of American Indians and very few ancient westerns do. This is exceptionally bad in this respect. The romance between Robertson and Darnell set his teeth on the edge as he came over and forced a kiss on her while playing the old hard to get games. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are inadvertently humorous, as the characters apparently don't really run in or on a stage shot in multiple shots. An eerie humorous event in the story is Linda Darnell's character is starting to buy tickets for the stage coach, so it takes only one horse to drive, minutes later, without apparent reason. Another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a crazy stop at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road, and not just that, but then all the passengers put in a look. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
