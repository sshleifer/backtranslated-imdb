Early 1950s Sci-Fi directed by Lesley Selander. Of course, special effects are very primitive, but quite good compared to what was otherwise out there then. Drive-in Movie dual function fare; still interesting enough to see. Two leading men, Arthur Franz, the brilliant young scientist Dr. Jim Barker and the straight-talking and terrestrial newspaper reporter Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell) are joined on a manned flight to Mars by Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston) another scientist and two other space experts (Richard Gaines and John Litel). Upon landing on the red planet, the spacecraft meets residents who seem friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the marches are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea of ​​conquering the Earth to revitalize their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Maruerite Chapman) who Dr. Barker intends to go back on the return flight. She is the movie's redeeming element.
