So you're a huge mantis and you've been hanging out in the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect to do? Head for the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe get a show on Broadway. But wait! When you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, some annoying people start attacking you !! Argh! Time to Smash! <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is a step up to most other gigantic bug movies because it has quite a decent FX in 1957. But it's about it. Avoid unless you really need to see another great bug smash thing, or watch another Perry Mason actor in a B movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
