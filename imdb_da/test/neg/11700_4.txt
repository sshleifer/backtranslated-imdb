This story was well over four older men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After all this, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me nod during the movie in the midst of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunderstorms. But it is worth waiting in the end when we find out who the mystery woman is, who keeps bothering the old men in their dreams and interfering with a young man's life. Most of what I liked about this movie was the excitement that the young woman looks to the men just before their death. The special effects were something. Every time I heard her cry to them, I would think "Not that face again." But it was a good movie, I just wished that the pace wasn't so slow or the performance not so tiring. And what I also liked about the movie was the flashback from the 20s, very authentic as well as the costumes were original.
