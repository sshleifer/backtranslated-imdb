Why is this not good when it first rocked? Try the fact that they were trying to replace Rodney Dangerfield with Jackie Mason! Please! It's like replacing the Beatles with Wierd Al. Randy Quaid is the only one who saves this movie from a zero. <br /> <br /> Don't let that stop you from seeing the first movie that was excellent.
