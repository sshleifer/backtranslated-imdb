I have a question for the authors and producers of "Prozac Nation": What is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film depicts a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as an author. But this is not a story of success, only one of self-destruction as we see Liz brings misery into life everyone who comes into contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, medication, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible causes of Liz's accident. But none of these superficial explanations is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the movie, it would have been helpful to suggest Liz should take responsibility for her life and her troubles. No light was shed on what the film claimed to be an ongoing problem in "the United States of Depression." In the story, Liz had a caregiver (Anne Heche), a caring room mate (Michele Williams), a caring girlfriend (Jason Biggs) and a worried but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In a key scene in the movie, Liz is in a hospital bed and looks at cleaning up the space shuttle Challenger. Instead of comparing Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for her recovery and recovery. This movie reminded me of a generic "victim" movie on the Lifetime network. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in Christina Ricci's serious performance. The Real Life Elizabeth Wurtzel, of course, herself found the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful writer. It is unfortunate that the film could not even offer us the slightest glimpse of her brave spirit.
