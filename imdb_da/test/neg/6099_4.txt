The three stooges are undoubtedly the greatest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they deserved a far better end in Columbia than they received with this brief. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" are just not good. Granted, this is not all Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I feel that some of his shorts are funny enough, simply because of the deviation from Stooges' usual fanfare that they contain and for the fact that Larry is sometimes exhibited more. But this short will just not do. And the fact that you know it's their last card ever shown well, it just adds to the overall disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie just indicates how short topics were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. This short is so sloppy. It is a simple re-insertion of a curly card, "What is Matador?" Filmed years before. As if this fact was not bad, the study actually threw pictures of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years earlier). Are these things not obvious? Laughable or sad? You're the judge. Another part of this card that makes it miserable is that it is basically a Joe Besser showcase where he shows that all he is (at least in this movie) is a Curly-wanna-be-gone -completely wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I also have to say that I feel a little shameful to make Besser use that joke Larry originally popularized in the short "Ants in Pantry". To see Besser say "I can't see, I can't see!" and Larry has the simple "Why can't you see?" while Besser gets the quip "I closed my eyes" is just wrong at all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers stuck It out for all those years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this brief. There is hardly any fun with them. The only thing that qualifies is that Larry hides under a jealous man's bed and tries to be "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it all to them. No matter how ridiculous things could get (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their careers). Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts are not pale from 1934-1959. I often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss so terribly. I'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. At least they contain new ideas. But this short, I think everyone can agree, is just not good. <br /> <br /> Thank you TV later, the boys discovered the shorts department closed. Had they been forced to go out this way, it would have been a gross injustice in all the years they invested in making the audience laugh.
