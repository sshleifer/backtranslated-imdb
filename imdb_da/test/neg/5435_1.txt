Anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This movie wasn't just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was horrible. Dylan Walsh? Rumor has it, Julia Roberts dumped your ass because this movie was blowing so badly. Big Diamonds? Killer gorillas? Do gorillas speak? Hmmm. Sounds like a hit! OH! Tim Curry's accent is so bad in this movie, I prefer to be deaf! I recommend this movie to bulimics who seek to cleanse after a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients who just need the only reason to die. If this is true in the book, I would say, let's get a good old-fashioned Footloose book that burns and destroys every copy. If future generations look back and find this waste, how would we explain ourselves? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Don't look at it! Run away! DO NOT watch this movie! If you think it's full of action or excitement or cool effects, you're wrong! If you think it's blowing more cock than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So if you still want to see Crapo .., I mean Congo, I say it after you just took 50 Tylenol PM.
