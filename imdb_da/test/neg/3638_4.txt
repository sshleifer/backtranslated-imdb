I've seen this program a few times, and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do this because she is Britneyy's sister, and I'm sorry to say that the show is obvious. They have created the character Zoey to be everything people would think Jamie Lynn is clever, original, smart, beautiful, popular, etc. The characters around her are only there to make her look better by being smarter then them, more popular than those more wanted by boys saw them. There is no original about this and it's poured money so every child has the coolest of fashion and things. I also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or yet old she can't be much older) she has very mature clothes, the short skirts are too short, it makes young people wear them and all this make-up This adds to the growing problems, why young girls get into so many problems. All I want to say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn, and given her age it is not at all bad, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. Sorry, it's too mature and yet stupid. It's badly traded with predictable story lines, and there's too much stereotyping going on too.
