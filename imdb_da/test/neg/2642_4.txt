"Milo" is another answer to a question no one has ever asked. We really need more slashes? I think we already have more than enough. I think the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous child, there is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels it. A long time ago he drowned, but it did not disturb him, and he still kills people ("Friday the 13th"). One day, his survivors have a great reunion and as a surprising twist, Milo comes to visit them. Through some really bad shots showing everything except the murders, thrown thinly until only the final girl is left to find out Milo's boring, I mean dark secret. She and her friends have been dying to know. When it is discovered, Milo goes on another murderous rampage (isn't it his bedtime yet?) And the girl she screams a lot. The play is not even the bottom of the barrel, the barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be a creepy bastard from time to time I give it to him, but some movies just can't be saved without a good script or free naked.
