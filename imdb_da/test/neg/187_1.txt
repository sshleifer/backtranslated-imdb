and I still don't know where the hell this movie goes? I really mean what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? It's about showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, was he, of course, playing the role of Ramirez in the highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand put in so little use? Where was there so much table relaxation? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy whom he shoots archery with? Did he know that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent whether it is raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact) who rise on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier) or have a French mother and are raised in indokina (i can't even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?
