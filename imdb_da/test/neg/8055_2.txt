This movie has too many things happened. Another reviewer comments on the film's heterogeneous episodic character, reflecting the director's memories - that's fine, if that's how it was written and performed. Instead, we even get progressive narrative - some of the time - jumping over and over and over, discarding us in some cases, interrupting the flow with unnecessary digressions in other cases, and otherwise it simply doesn't work. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot details that just don't work. Why does a body draw on a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to the night? Why does your flat sheet leave the body? Why would an artist who knew Joe the character for a short time decide to leave him "everything" (though not much)? This subplot was poorly developed to make this point work. For that matter, why does the man himself have an invalid or other artist than to give the money and the free naked scenes? He could just as easily have been a photographer or an opera composer? How does anyone judge an apartment in an opera house - especially without any clear connection to the opera? The coincidences are also both obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Why should the guys take everything in the warehouse and "disappear." If Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a city as small as Bangor, how could Joe lose him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough that you would recommend the other to a job. <br /> <br /> Some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend and sister who want to escape felt like padding. There are some good ideas that might have made a full-fledged feature or might have been Interesting shorts, which finished this film a little sense and offers even less.
