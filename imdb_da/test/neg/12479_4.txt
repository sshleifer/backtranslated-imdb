There are some horror directors for whom I have built so much respect and admiration over the years that they cannot disappoint me knowing what is different about deciding to film. Lucio Fulci is definitely one of them, but damned, he tries to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily advise yourself to skip most of the movies Fulci directed or produced in the late 80s and simply see "Cat in the Brain" instead, because one title collects and repeats the best and absolute best audio file of no less than seven other Fulci flicks, including the sickest murder sequences with "When Alice Broke the Mirror". As a whole, this film is definitely one of our director's weakest and most meaningless results. The scripture is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally unreliable and a little stupid, and there is absolutely no excitement to enjoy. I love the title, but it's actually pretty pointless. There is a character named Alice in history, but it is only a supporting role and she certainly does not break any mirrors. I suppose she could break things just by using her voice as she is an opera singer, but she doesn't. The reason is about a middle-aged and gambling-dependent playboy who spends his days seducing rich widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson beats the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in cruel ways, making steaks out of their most beautiful body parts and feeding the remainders to his cat. There is also a silly psychological plot where he believes his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of Fulci's greatest horror films ("The Beyond", "Living of the Living Dead", "") lies in the fact that he does not bother annoyingly to create a horrible sign, including Lester, are colorless and dull, and the murders are usually depicted, just as it is the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car. The lighting is poor, the cinematography is super-ugly, editing clumsy and amateurish, and the performances are downright miserable. If I didn't know anything better, I would think that Lucio had deliberately made a miserable movie to protest against all the hard critics who don't like his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he has put into it. The obvious element to enjoy here is simply the monstrous gore and bloodshed because even attempts to blend in black comedy do not work properly. Swings around his chainsaw and cuts women's feet, "When Alice Broke Mirror" is an indispensable piece of horror entertainment, but apart from that there is not much to recommend.
