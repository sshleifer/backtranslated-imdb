Ho humm - - - Nothing more. If you are a Rush fan for a long time, you know what this video contains: Lying songs from the past, "BIG 3" hits from the 80s and their "last dunk" efforts to stay modern. They succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the battlefield by portraying themselves as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they fail to protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only add to these guys having been. <br /> <br /> If you have followed (as much as you can stomach) the band for a few decades from the 70's, then you know there is no new material here. Same old, same old one: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no real back scenes (Geddy loses his shoes?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) No new insights. <Br /> <br /> A better video would have been to show the CREW setup for 3 or 4 hours ?? let the camera run. And stop changing camera angles every two seconds! I understand that the director wants to try to do something artificial. But then you offer a complete concert version of 2 or 3 pictures that VIEWER can choose. We know what the band looks like? Let's see what we really want to see. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a great service: Rent this movie first.
