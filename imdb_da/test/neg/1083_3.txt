This series takes a classic story and rubbish it. Robin is somehow mystified by a moose in the forest and involved in all forms of druidism and direct satanic episodes. History is more about avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. This is hardly visible. And to the top of all that ridiculous, they kill Robin at the end of Series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people like this show as a fantasy show, but it's NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin beat King Richard's name to Prince John and the Sheriff, and if you want Robin feeding the poor and oppressed, then watch the classic series or the latest from the BBC.
