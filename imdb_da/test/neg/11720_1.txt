This movie was not only disappointing for the horror / suspense movie lover, it was disappointing for anyone who sees it. WoW. I thought this movie might be fun because the guy with the big head. However, it was filled with long and pronounced conversation that was not necessary. There was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This movie was not only boring, but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. That way, each scene looks as if it was light from a single bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because it ultimately feels like wasted time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Party
