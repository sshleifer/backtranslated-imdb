This narrative of the upper classes that get their comedies in their high misery is like a modern Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie where she suffered from mink. Here, people behave in a frightening civilized way as opposed to adversity. A well-stocked London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that his wife not only has an affair with the local gentry, but also killed her housekeeper in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise his rigid upper lip barely stiffens. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park" (this is his direct debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical, though not sure how much of the comedy is calculated. It is like a return to British film from the forties, where characters all appeared as characters in books or play rather than as humans, perhaps in reality. But that's not all bad. Wilkinson is great, even if you never believe him as a person, while Emily Watson (the haughty wife) and Rupert Everett (the very amorous high-grade clothing) both are very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' film image ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear, it is always good on the eye.
