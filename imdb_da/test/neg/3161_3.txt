This is a film with a lot of potential, well done and acted on a fairly weekly and inconsistent script. A young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment because the husbands flat on top of the workshop, where he cuts stolen cars, aggravates their son's asthma. He ends up in jail when a former patrol's stolen car is tracked to his shop, ex pat becomes a friendly, generous and naive shmoe (and rather cardboard and we learn nothing from him), but ends with the girl who "acts" despite that she is only sexually satisfied by her husband. I expect this movie to be successful in the Czech Republic, where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise - "The ex-pats can have money, they can even get our women, but they are old, soft and our women will be satisfied, we can be poor, but .... Now, if only Evzen could keep Marcela happy, then she would not have to play with herself or if he already had an existing family in Italy ... but it would complicated things.
