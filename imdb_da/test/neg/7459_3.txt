before i watched this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dick's story. I haven't had that movie much, but this adaptation in 1974 goes in a particularly tiring way. The actors are not shining, the main couple Michael York and Sarah miles are especially wooden boxes. the only sign of real interest to me was anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. It's a real lesson on how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what others say you are what you are if others can't take it, **** them. beep was told it early, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> The girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little about the old bastard hauser story, not at the same terrible level, but in the way she shaped the baby to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the opposite sex she thought had deceived her. Pips childhood did not seem much better. The end didn't seem to fit the rest of the history style. the sets so cheap and come to imdb. I'm not surprised to see that this was really a TV movie (which I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> Live and Learn. So many good movies, so little time. therefore the reviews are here. So you don't have to waste your time on this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
