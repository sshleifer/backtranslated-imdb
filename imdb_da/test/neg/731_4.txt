The imprisoned premise for this flick has to do with Argentina, which regains the Falkland Islands when they lost power in 1982 by impregnating the European female inhabitants with Argentine semen, thereby diluting ethnic purity until the favored Argentina. Yeah right. Reconnaissance is made by our hero / villas and cad, Fabian, which derives its fish-eye camcorder from the pillar to subsequently film its meetings with the Falkland, including his chin and any conquest of a woman, Camilla. An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary favors this flick us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla turn through the usual moments of awkward and insecurity as they come from the handshake to the bed. "F * ckland" is only for the biographical purists who can appreciate the grim, no frills, jigglecam austerity of Dogme indies.
