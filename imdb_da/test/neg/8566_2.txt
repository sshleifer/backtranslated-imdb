The only good thing in this movie is its last twist. In 97 minutes of film, we can only save a single idea that was completely wasted in this movie I must say! For more than 90 minutes, this movie is just a collection of clichés, bad deeds, stupid ideas and revelations, complete lack of excitement, stupid deaths, horrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot ?? Until the last three minutes, finally, a good idea appeared! It's not an excellent or an extremely original idea, but at least a "decent" good idea was the only whole movie to have! I don't want to spoil it, but I have to say that I think the idea of ​​a better plot, better FX and definitely a better play would turn into a good movie. If you watch this movie and can stand it to the end, you will know what it is ??
