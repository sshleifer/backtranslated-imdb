I watched this movie and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect, but as soon as the movie was on, it was nice to see it. The idea was pretty original and the play was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending. But the film was missing. For a change, an end scene in a hospital where all employees are suddenly gone. First, do you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> No shouting for help while being chased by Tamara, Escaping to the roof (also a smart move ... not) and off of course some kind of open end. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie started well, the majority was nice to watch, but they really spoiled the end with all the cliches from bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really great movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good scare full of clich√©s, Tamara is a good movie to see. For me, I like movies that surprise me.
