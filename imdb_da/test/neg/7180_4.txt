This movie just doesn't work. No two ways about it. I saw it for the first time back in '98 when it was released and I didn't like it. I just bought it for sale a few days ago, because I was thinking "what should I try?". I don't regret the money I issued to Hamilton, but the facts remained the same. This movie is pointless, boring and uninteresting. Stormers are usually a pleasure, but that is when he makes movies in the United States. At home he does not do the trick. Sure the movie is well made (if you forget the odd stock footage here), but ultimately the only thing that really raises Hamilton is over a star's waste, Hamill's turn as the bad guy Hawkins. He has serious fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the film. "Swedish intelligence, huh? Now there is a contradiction in terms" and when he allows Hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the girl. And it's really pretty much it. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
