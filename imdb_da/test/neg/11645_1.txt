An old high school teacher used to boast that he had seen every movie ever made, so one day one of my friends and I decided to make a movie called "Pacific Inferno". Later we came into an argument whether the lead role was played by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting so he came up to us and informed us that the starring role of "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was caught in a lie, that was until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's terrible. Our made films had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better at the picture.
