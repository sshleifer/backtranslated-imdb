I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book for my kids as they were small. I was very disappointed with the movie. A sign is quite annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of nails on a blackboard. There is a completely unnecessary train / roller coaster scene. There are some signs and scenes that seem scary to small children for whom this movie was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the Elves could have been sweet and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually does not seem to make a short children's book in a feature film. This movie is completely on my nerves.
