Terrible action movie where leader Franco Nero exchanges his cowboy hat, pistol belt and coffin he dragged in DJANGO (1966) into a white Ninja outfit with all the cool accessories included! Despite almost non-stop action, the movie is completely cliched and unintentionally fun - with a campy villain starting in Christopher George. Susan George (no relation) is the attractive woman with a rinsed man, Nero's wartime companion, who the bad guys are trying to push his oily land - but the latter has not counted on Nero's martial arts (and stunt -heavy) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a similarly capable ninja for himself who, as happens, turns out to be Nero's deadly enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two successors and is currently engaged in another!). The Climax takes place inside an arena where one-man army Nero 'eliminates' George and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations; However, the subtle way in which he transmits his nemesis is effectively done.
