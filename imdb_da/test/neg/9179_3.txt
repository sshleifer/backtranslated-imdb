Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine the WORST movie that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what was required anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction. They didn't get here. Rothrock gets to throw a few kicks at the end, but this movie is so horrible that you probably won't be awake watching them. (*)
