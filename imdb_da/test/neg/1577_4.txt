After a blizzard, the roads are blocked and the highway patron Jason (Adam Beach) comes to his friend, Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow), and advises his customers that they will only be able to follow their tours the next day. Among the strange strangers, Jason meets his former sweet Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. At night, with no communication with his base, Jason faces troubled and suspicious situations with the clients and finds some corpses, indicating that among them is a killer. "The Last Stop" could be an average thriller, but the manuscript is simply horrible. Most of the characters are despicable, and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never revealed, and the viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
