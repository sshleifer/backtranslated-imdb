... and boy is the collision deaf. A female telephone lineman is taken over by the spirit of a newly deceased ninja, strips down to her underpants, pours tomato juice on her body, so her boyfriend can lick it out, perform a seductive dance, and then go out to kill the policemen killed the ninja she holds of. Only to be chased by a one-eyed ninja master. Like in real life, eh? Experienced only by Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his falling to put his obnoxious children into this), you really have to see this to believe it. It is the ultimate blend of all odds genres.
