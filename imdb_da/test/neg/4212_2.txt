Breaker! Breaker! have chuck norris as truck driver and karate master, talk about juggling two different careers. He gives a load that he cannot deliver to his younger brother Michael Augenstein, and so when the young man doesn't come up, Chuck is looking for him. <br /> <br /> What young Augenstein has gotten into is a speed-trap run by Judge George Murdock, coming from the Roy Bean School of Jurisprudence. Of course, Norri's questions deal with the usual Chuck Norris way, and when he gets into trouble, the call goes beyond the CB because all truckers are going to help their good friend. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation, and the drivers are just too happy to help a friend. Chuck is of course quite younger and without facial hair in this. He has the tight look of a man who realizes that the academy does not look at this gobbler. George Murdock exaggerates greatly as judge Roy Bean Wannabe. <br /> <br /> This one is strictly for fans of Chuck Norris.
