If I hadn't had any expectations for this movie, it could have gotten a 5 or 6. As it stands, I give it a 3. The action is poor, the factual accuracy of the substances being discussed is missing, and I I have not seen some empathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Adam & Paul' just before I watched this movie and I both laugh and cry on several occasions. This movie didn't even strike a similar chord. The managers of "human traffic" may have some extreme experience with ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of current drug-related semantic knowledge here. In fact, I find it rather offensive and counterproductive for the struggle to make current drug laws less politically oriented. <br /> <br /> See 'Requiem for a Dream', if what you're looking for is a fantastic, moving movie about drugs.
