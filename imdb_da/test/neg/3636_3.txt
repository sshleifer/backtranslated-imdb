The only time I actually laugh while watching this show is when I do fun. Jamie Lynn Spears only got the working job because of her sister sister, and I don't think anyone could argue with me on that. There is no expression in her face ever (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you will see what I mean. Now let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen! As many people have already said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she is a straight One student, and all the boys think she is "hot." PCA is a boarding school full of rich children, giving all their students flat screen TVs and laptops that serve children's sushi from the sushi bar. In one of the latest episodes, Zoey is completely clueless and thinks Chase is not in love with her and seems like she doesn't even want Chase to love her. So when she gets into Chase's dorm to prove her friends wrong, she finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course freaks out, probably because she likes the attention of Chase. Anyway, just watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on TV is Zoey 101. At least you can have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
