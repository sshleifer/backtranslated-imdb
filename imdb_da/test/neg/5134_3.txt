OK, I don't want to disturb anyone who's had this movie, but it was a really bad movie. Just as the scenes were edited and the play, it made me cut some points. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student movie, they must have had the smallest budget. I really liked the story to a degree and the characters were sympathetic, but the movie on a whole was just awful. Also, why is it that in almost every lesbian character movie, one of them must either commit suicide or die or turn right?!? This then sends a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything I found was very friendly to me. Just watch this movie if you want to laugh, how bad it is.
