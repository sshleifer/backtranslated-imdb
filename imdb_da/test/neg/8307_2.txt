What a horrible movie! The action in this movie is about the quality of a high school play, or a story-driven pornographic film. This is not pornography in this movie but there is certainly a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the movie, one of the only things that saved it from receiving a star rating. There is also a million police who die in this movie. Hardly offensive, but since the violence is so unrealistic, we can only laugh. But boobs run out and are exposed for the most surprising and fun times, if you really enjoy really bad movies, check this out. This is a Bonnie and Clyde type story where a mother and her two daughters are out of revenge. This movie also has a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen rolling around naked!
