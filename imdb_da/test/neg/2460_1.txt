A bunch of medical students yuppies meet in their spare time to connect each other to the electric cables and die. Then they are about to count the time before brain death, then start CPR and heart massage and bring each other back to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie should say everything. FLATLINERS is like GHOST. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead friends, so what better way to do it than to have a lot of medical students kills you for five minutes and then brings you back to life. The rest of the movie has predictable relationship problems plus the predictable "GEE MAYBE if we are killing each other, one of these days one of us will remain dead" D'OH !!! This movie should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were depicted as medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to get their degrees. The only thing that kept this movie from being totally laughing was that they didn't just keep their fingers in sockets to "die". This movie would have been a fantastic THREE STOOGES comedy movie.
