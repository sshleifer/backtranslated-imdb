This movie is crappy beyond all limits. It's amazing - a very bad ripoff from Jaws and other (better) shark movies. A really bad - everything is really pathetic. The story is cleanest crap, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity at all. It seems that some really weakened children took Jaw's script and arranged it randomly, then the parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the film with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just a little "elevator" music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, so a little less optimistic when the shark is around or when kids get depressed (again listening to very loud elevator music). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed that he should ask for his name to be deleted from the titles !! The film acts as a perfect demonstration of how crappy music will destroy *** ANY *** scene that has to be exciting. However, there is a big difference for Jaws: At the beginning of Jaws, there are comments on stupid people trying to kill shark with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this does not work, guys take a *** BIG LOAD *** of dynamite and used as 1/4 film by placing explosives in some submerged ship. This is truly the original way to catch the fish I have to admit! They use as much dynamite as they would try to kill a battleship (I guess Bismarck class of battleship) or dig another Panama channel. This is just amazing. I'm glad they didn't try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad about. 2 m shark. Well, there is mystery disappearing native Indian (which resembles German retirees) also in this mess. This is not a movie, this is a warning example how bad the movies can be! As a warning it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most Italian movies are bad, but this ... this is truly unique in the worst sense of the word.
