Masters Horror: Sounds Like is set in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as head of a computer software call center, has lost his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) for a rare heart disease, he believes he has ultra-sensitive hearing. Larry hears ten times, from people writing on the computer's keyboards, people whispering across the room, people tapping their feet on the floor, dripping faucets and eventually even breathing people, unbearable to Larry, when he is constantly bombarded with the mind's piercing noise. Finally, Larry decides that he has had enough, and if he can't stop the sounds himself, he might even stop hearing them using a big meat-ready ... This Canadian American co-production was episode 4 from season 2 of the general hit-and-miss Masters of Horror TV series, written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like was a definite miss. The script was based on a short story by Mike O'Driscoll & I'm really surprised at the number of very positive comments it has on IMDb at this time, for a start I would be very hard pressed to even describe this as a horror movies and it feels more like something bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the boys at KNB effects actually get some work. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify sound and sounds from the beginning, so this episode ends as 55 minutes of exactly the same kind of repetitive structure, leading to a gory ending, even though it arrives late to save the episode. This is pretty slow & while it is well written, it is not supposed to be horror theme and I am a little confused about who this is supposed to appeal to? Director Anderson makes it ok, but he just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again, until the last 5 minutes there is not a single drop of blood throughout the case. There is no horror, there are no scares or tensions and absolutely no atmosphere. Technically, this is very well made, has good production values ​​and does not look like a cheap program for TV. The play is very good indeed, and it is shame that the story is a bit limited. Sounds Which is one of the very worst Masters of Horror episodes, many people seem to like it, and that's fine, but that's certainly not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
