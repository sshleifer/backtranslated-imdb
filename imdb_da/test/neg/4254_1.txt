It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would anyone make a movie about getting away with murder!?! Mr. Allen again plays the only kind of character he can, the sexually stupid man who can't get the girl. Get a little, Allen, there's a reason that's the only sign you can successfully imagine. Touch this movie! It is a waste of time unless you want to know how to successfully kill someone. I'm sorry about the actors who say 'yes' to Woody Allen. Look at his throw and tell me how many of them are still working. My respect for all the actors who work for him goes straight down because they chose to participate in the movie.
