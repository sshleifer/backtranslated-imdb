I first read about the Left Bag series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it as I am interested in how religion is used to control people in our increasingly hated world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of the left behind: the world of war in my local library, innocent among the big budget-active films. <br /> <br /> Now, as a movie, it's extremely bad. The action is straight from a primary school production, and "special effects" would have been dated in the early 90s. Being the third part of a series, the story would be incomprehensible to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other Left Behind movies, and even with my previous knowledge, it was still quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> On a religious front, I don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the Lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways. How do you fear the Antichrist when he has a comedy-Russian accent, and the worst of his forces is some pitiful CGI? <br /> <br /> But my biggest problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and push people into thinking it's a big budget action movie. By downloading the box and reading the game I immediately saw something odd ... nowhere on the packaging was there mention of the true nature of this film. For anyone who is not in knowledge, it seems to all intentions and intent that the left behind: the world of war was no different than the latest Tom Clancey. On the copy I rented, it also said nothing about it being the third in a series. Given the series' entire premise is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers tried to deceive me twice before I even got the counter! If you're so stuck in your beliefs then why not be honest with it? The simple fact is, if this was not a "Christian" movie with the built-in fan base that comes with it, I seriously doubt that it would ever have seen the light of day. If Cloud Ten had hoped that I would see the error in my ways and give me to God, I am afraid to say that I would be dead of boredom and / or laugh myself before I ever had the chance.
