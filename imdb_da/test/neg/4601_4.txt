This movie has some good lines, but the observation of Dillon's less than masterful Rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she's not a Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> Also, in my opinion, the first movie rule is to make the protagonist you are interested in. You may not love the character, but you have to worry about what happens to him. This is achieved in Barfly with the hilarious running gag about the games with Eddie the bartender. The main game in Factotum is, when he unconsciously steals him up to the Lily Taylor character in a bar, hits her on the floor and calls her a whore. It just didn't work. Again, some good lines - some laughs - incredibly fun - but as a movie in general it's a mistake. Mediocre attempt to reinvent something that was brilliant and you can't get past it. Next? Let's restore breakfast at Tiffany's with Kate Hudson.
