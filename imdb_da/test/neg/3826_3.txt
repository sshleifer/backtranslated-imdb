Tim Curry was the reason why I wanted to watch this movie, and of course his appearance is always entertaining, he is basically wasted on it. The rest of the casting is not too good either in this remake of an early zombie film that has extremely graphic effects that are completely unnecessary. To quote a popular axiom is sometimes less.
