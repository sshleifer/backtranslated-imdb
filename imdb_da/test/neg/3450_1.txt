This was among the worst movies I have ever encountered. The cinematography was dull, with long boring images (like a camera on a tripod that recorded a scene game) with "dramatic" angles that didn't make sense to the screen content. The editing was horrible, scenes matched with a butcher's delicacy. The plot hinged on the viewer, who was familiar with the historic night, where Mary Shelley wrote the Frankie path. The action was forced with the kind of character development that left you with great interest in seeing each of them die terribly (the sooner the better).
