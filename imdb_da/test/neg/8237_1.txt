This movie series. No money, no action, nothing. I caught this at 3 am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it was ever released for American TV! No one in this movie can act out of a paper bag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like hand-popped "monster" ... I can't even begin to tell you how the rock bottom this production is. It looks like it might cost $ 50,000 to shoot, but only because it's 16mm, and that's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I lost interest quickly and had to settle to see "Matlock" craze instead of finishing it. This is BAD this movie !!!
