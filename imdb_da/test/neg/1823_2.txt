Simply miserable Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza vehicle. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but he rarely uses it in a movie reminding me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is also not a leading man. He looks like an elderly man who is ready to collect social security and fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the supportive cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds gets so little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes to the end to announce that our King Ezio could better return to his people. As far as I'm concerned, the faster the better. Is it that Lana Turner really sings with Pinza? Not bad if it's her. The picture will also remind me of the 1960 film "The Prince and the Showgirl" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
