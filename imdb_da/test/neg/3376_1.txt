Ill-conceived sequel (.. the absurd idea of ​​having the killer on an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather) brings the psychopath's spirit back, thanks to a scientific experiment that provides alien elements that reintroduce the life of its molecules (... that's the best thing I could do to explain this upscale concept). <br /> <br /> I could go into depth on how he won on the island to kill many tourists, but I simply didn't find any reason to disturb because it would all be so exhausting. Still, the filmmakers believe that it is wise to kill the beautiful girls not ten minutes after their arrival (.. I think seriously, why worry about introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer here? !). <br /> <br /> The moth scene "snow mothil" takes the cake. Isicals protrude from the sand of the beach, so a victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl is stuck with a pair of weenie pliers. See, I get what comes to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie .. so a ridiculously supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone ("Oh, that's such a wonderful cheesy horror movie!") Or Have you thought about why in hell you waste time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (.. how could they then melt him in the first movie?) And cause the island resort to snow. A sequence has Jack-freezing pool water that encloses a swimming model underneath the plate, resulting in her drowned with nowhere to escape. And there is also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from The Christmas Story ("Cowatonga Guy!"). <br /> <br /> Even though they are real troops to try to make this miserable material entertain, I'll give it to you. Christopher Allport (maybe maybe unwise) returns as Sam to meet his old nemesis, like Eileen Seeley, as his wife. The trials of the tongue-in-kind humor (.. at least for me) fell flat, but the thrown forward soldiers are trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with exciting performances doing their best to rise above it pitiful premise and unhappy dialogue. <br /> <br /> A development is evolving that increases the danger to those who are still around to resist Jack, his genetically modified water molecules thanks to the introduced alien elements allow him to resist refrigerant / freezer, and yet worse, he can now reproduce. Through indigestion, Jack claims what seems to be snowballs that close to reveal small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The killed snowman suit and the little snowball dolls introduced later in the movie can produce bellybeats if you're in the mood for such shenanigans, but I personally found this junk rather hokey (that's the purpose behind it, I assume cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this) and unbearable. Snowball offspring is an obvious tribute to Gremlins, where we get a bar scene where the little bastards celebrate in numbers over terrorizing victims at the resort. The weapon against them .. bananas! It is explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, both fell in a truck bed full of antifreeze (an ice body originating from Jack's stomach penetrated Sam's chest as he pushed them out into a window in the truck bed and I assume they are "connected" to the ice, inherited Sam's banana allergy, or it is here that we are led to believe!) and then "merged" in a way. <br /> <br /> Phew, such a movie as this speaks simple explanation. It's a movie with effects and plot so awful you can find the presentation comfortable because of it's many mistakes.
