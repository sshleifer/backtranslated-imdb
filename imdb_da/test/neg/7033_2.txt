This was a horrible bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was horrible, she didn't have any of Shirley Temple's charm at all! The horrible smile she would do when she shrank with her little little eyes in a way that I thought was "supposed to be sweet and make the audience go" - aahhhh blessing! It just made me relax her. She must have swum "Oh my goodneth!" about a hundred times throughout the film. Also she could hardly pronounce a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle. Horrible HORRIBLE movie. If I could judge it minus 10, I would. Don't waste your money on this piece of waste, go out and buy a real Shirley Temple movie!
