I got stuck in the traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (on a military base) to watch Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie game was "See No Evil", there was no poster up for it and just a brief description of the movie on the chart ... but my boyfriend and I decided to check it out ... As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE, I just knew it was terrible. The few people in the theater laughed most of the time, and that was the first movie I honestly considered going out on, and I've seen "The Ringer" ... okay, I'd have gone out of one, but I was too busy sleeping. The bad guy's death at the end was pretty good, but apart from that, it was just stupid.
