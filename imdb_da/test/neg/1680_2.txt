An elite US military team that obviously happens to include two beautiful women and a guy who can't quite understand teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a Spetznaz team that seems like a gang that can't shoot straight - all Thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre action. This one has little to do for it. The characters are not convincing. Even the setting, which has great opportunities, looks like something out of the middle of Pennsylvania, not an exotic Boreal forest in Eastern Europe. Bats are surely wild. They can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpier?) Or chop an arm. You see the Delta Force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guy shooting gun and pistols on them and bat fluttering to the ground. It would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. Totally unclear. The dialogue is extremely unrealistic, with boy / girl jokes and whistles in the midst of tense parts of the mission. One of the team is blown up by a mine, and the first on stage just stares in his body, stunned, not even disturbing to cover or secure the area. In fact, after the rest of the group turns out, he talks about how the area is laid out as a minefield - thanks for heads up bub. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check outpost. Harvest is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'll give it a two instead of a three if I can handle it through the other half. Seems unlikely at this time.
