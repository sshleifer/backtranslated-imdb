WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, my expectations were that it was a vampire movie that would be great considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the movie. I started about 15 minutes into it, and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain which shocked me. First, the story that was with was not at all appealing, and it was just as flat and boring to the point where I would just turn it off. I got more frustrated with this movie when it turned on, but I assumed I was hoping it would get better .... when it finally showed vampires, it became MY MIND, in a very bad way. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a bit of a recurring horrible story about these two criminals, so became very slow to a vampire movie that I thought it should be from the beginning, like the last 30 minutes?" To add to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and amazing and mean at the end when they just aren't; A rabbit would have been more scary than these characters! This movie is a terrible piece of shit !!! From foam to dawn, I shamed and left a horrible taste in my mouth, discouraging thoughts in my head and leaving my body unable to move from the horrible shock that I just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a terrible movie. I don't understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, who are all good and honorable actors, are able to participate in this useless filth. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies ever made, which I have seen my eyes on. Don't see it, you make yourself a big advantage ...
