Strawberry Blonde has a good script, but I just wish Errol Flynn was in it instead of James Cagney, he is not the person who is for that part. I think Olivia did a good job. This movie is also a daydream break, so it's hard to follow. I do not like the male character setting; The way Cagney presented it was right. I give it a 3 for bad deal of the main male character. (If you like tough ruff men who like to fight all the time and argue then it's your movie). Strawberry blonde would have been better if the protagonist had a more positive attitude and changed the script so he is happy he is with Oliva. This movie points out Money doesn't bring happiness, women real jokes. Ordinary and simple not the best movie, but everyone must decide for themselves.
