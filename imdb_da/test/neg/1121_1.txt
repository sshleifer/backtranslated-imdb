Making the fourth theatrical release (one National Lampoon took its name OFF) looks like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a tedious attempt to exploit a once proud franchise. Painfully unfunny and unwatchable ... even for a TV movie! The Cousin Eddie character has become progressively less entertaining from the original holiday as it was fresh and unique throughout the Christmas holidays as it began to wear a little thin to Vegas Vacation, where it was actually annoying to see the screen (but in fairness there was a lot of things that were annoying to see coming on the screen in that movie!). But this attempt to move the character to lead status is unfortunately the least said. The holiday movies even met a nasty death in Las Vegas and this hope of reviving even the thinnest line in the television series was thoroughly misunderstood. Chevy Chase and company put together a great trilogy when he was in his prime; Now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (A little note of interest: The original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play the part, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later! You are only left to wonder ... WHY ?)
