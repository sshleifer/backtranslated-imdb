B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying a gigantic leftist (not as leftist as the G. Kennedy successor who came after that). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest movie of the two followers very ugly look. It's slapdash. B. Kennedy made it reinforcing ?? but without having genius for it. Hundreds of peonies, hundreds of Mexican _compadres, hundreds of women, a desert, barren landscapes, a storm ?? the largest scale. Everything in this clumsy successor, who only likes in a strange way, is false. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very ugly in appearance. Brynner, who has done the best in the first film, does not look good in this. Rey plays a priest; he will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next successor of the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have so many characters, you may not need a very interesting story; Sometimes. For example, Brynner McQueen meets; then choose the other 'compadres'; or, B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It is fun to see where and how they will meet the rest of the crew, etc. But you have at least these more characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's installments are not very good at it. <br /> <br /> The return of the seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Wine and chris meet there; they decide to save the third survivor of the original Magnificents ?? Chico belonging to a large group of 300 peons abducted by the Mexican bandits. We find out the name of Chicy's attractive wife? It's Petra. Chris must again be a small army ?? and here we have a Dirty Dozen treat? Chris chooses his men from the prisoners. Another member of the command is a womanizer who will look after the women without a man. The sexual humor is especially unsatisfactory and uncomfortable in this movie. It strives to be smart and spicy; It is simply boring and stupid and rough. <br /> <br /> The selection of members of the small army was one of the greatest joys of McQueen movies. Unfortunately, in the first successor there is the most unmemorable of the three crews gathered under the Magnificent Sevens name. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes a miserable "Wine"; Oates is a smiley womanizer. <br /> <In this mocke? Giant Trials Have a Mexican Revolutionary Lead a Gigantic Plan? He kidnap 300 peons and use them to build a village and a church in memory of his lost sons. (Unsuspecting to say that this crazy Mexican revolutionist does not correspond to Wallach's role in the first film.) B. Kennedy counts exclusively on the camp and over ?? the top things: ugly landscapes, thunderstorms, gigantic lightning, a desert. A big blow between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros. Of course, the return of the seven (1966) completely left the good feeling of the McQueen film. It is particularly shocking that this sequel came quite quickly after the original film, but everything changed over time to make Western. <br /> <br /> Both followers look weird.
