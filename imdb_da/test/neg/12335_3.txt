This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script, which was mainly used in the beginning. Then the holes began to emerge in the story that one could drive a truck through. The film followed a downward curve from good to ordinary to poor to ridiculous at the time it concluded. It is not recommended.
