This movie was horrible! My friend and I were so sad, we quickly jumped through the last half of the movie just to see what happened. It is the typical type of sport she wins or loses. The only extremely interesting thing was when one guy refers to someone like a Veg e-tab. It will be a line my friend and I bring up for years to remind us of this colossal cheesy cliche waste of time
