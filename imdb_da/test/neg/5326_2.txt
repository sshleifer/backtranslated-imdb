One of the stupid movies in the history of the cinema. Wait, I'll take it back - this movie can't be included in any category related to "cinema"; It belongs to categories such as "waste", Turks or similar categories. Ironically, it is even _about_ two garbagemen. The film is "Men at Work", a light-critical comedy starring the Estevez (Sheen) brothers from 1990. To set aside the asinine and incredible plot line, bad acting, poor dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapsticks, continuity errors and high speed by non-named actors who are never seen again, all in all, it was a pretty bad movie anyway (essentially I mean). It was the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: You can see it about 200 times, learn each line, and in a campy kind repeat them back and forth publicly with your * wasted * friends and thus secure your status as the biggest dorks in your 10th grade. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually submitted an IMDb trivia post (along with this bad review) to the movie's IMDb website, if only because I saw a silly little punk music joke there apparently no one else spotted yet (about the Butthole Surfer statue). I'm so contradictory as to why I should even * waste my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note when what I really want to do is blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he has already done it himself. Guy !) I am so happy that I * wasted * only time on this, not real money. For that matter, may I have at least one tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with just what they used to blow up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background and turning useless extras (hands) into color pulp. I would like to mention Emilio's written credit, but it would be a stretch to call this manuscript "write" - it's more like cross-over cartoon ideas. And Charlie Sheen, if you read this, I assume M.A.W. must have been made in that part of your career where you were a coked-up, hooker-loving Hollywood brat who hadn't grown up yet. (Oops! Sorry, I think part of your life is not over yet. Get it good soon, you "half man." Such a promising talent, so * wasted * otherwise see there is that word again. )
