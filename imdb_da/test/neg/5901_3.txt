When released, this movie caused a sensation. I saw it and was thrilled. Beautiful, usually young, naked women admitted in the stylish style we knew so well from Director Hamilton's photography. His photographs never become porn and the same goes for this movie. Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core of extremely slow scenes, all filmed with some petroleum jelly on the lenses, is actually all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not true creatures with a soul. In fact, nothing happens. It is like Hamilton photographing using moving images instead of still images. And it gets so boring after a while. I didn't even look at everything else because I fell asleep. That's all that's left of this masterpiece: it's a very good sleeping pill. And you will never depend on it! <br /> <br /> Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
