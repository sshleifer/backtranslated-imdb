Seagal was far from the mark with this movie. I am a fan of his and will expect cool fighting scenes and sharp a liners, but this movie had none of this, instead it had injections and cheesy music. Though you are a fan of his, I strongly recommend you to stay away from this movie and see in the siege or even deadly place instead.
