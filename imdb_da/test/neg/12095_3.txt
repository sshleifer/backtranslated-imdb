Consider "I Know All" Action hero shines a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / seek out the evil boys. (Probably giving a signal light to say here, I'm coming) <br /> <br /> It's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the Comedy category.) Terrible control, horrible script, bad action, cheap special effects. (They used a tunnel so they can hide there appearing in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (this also to make me laugh looking at the pathetic errors)
