This was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god who is Koontz? I refuse to believe that the studio purchased the rights to this movie for something using the Genius' Koontz name. Ever since I was poor enough to demand Large Print, I have not been able to read this book as I had at least twice a year since it first read it. I missed the book highly and couldn't find it in Large Print. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to rent this movie, I would at least get my vicarious Watcher's pleasures, but this movie was a travesty. Because of subtle plot points, it is my belief that none of Mr. Koontz's or most decent writers for that matter can bend in 1-2 hours of film. It will be the smart network, cable or some other person who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multi-page TV movie, ie. mini series, of this book the right way! <br /> <br /> One in five out of five - what I could go lower ...
