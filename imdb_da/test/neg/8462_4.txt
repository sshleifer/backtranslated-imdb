this movie is not so good ... but it's good when you just want to laugh because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are many mistakes in it and it's cheesy. I got this movie for Christmas as five years ago, but for some reason I've never given it away. I guess I just like it for a rainy day, although I only see it as once a year. This is a very 90's movie, so it's really fun to see how all dresses and works. this movie is good for a young ... even if it comes to thinking about it, i couldn't even like it much when i was like 12, but that's just my personal opinion. The movie was really predictable. I wish it had had some weird twists, but I suppose it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. I think it was appropriate for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a bit discouraged, but certainly enough for family material.
