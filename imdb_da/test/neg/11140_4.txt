Yes, it is clean trash can. It may be interesting for any guy who likes experimental cinema (like me) to watch lowlifes babbling and not do anything for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize that you have actually paid for this. This is probably one of the movies you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism. However, I accept it for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
