Everything you do in this world must at least make a little sense. Unfortunately, very little of "Delusion" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is sufficient in her role as the main press of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overcomes the annoyance point. Jim Metzler, the amazing yuppie is very incredible as a beginner, revenge quest, opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money, she has been carefully hidden, all credibility flying out of the window, and the weapons pointing to the final showdown between Secor and Metzler are countless ridiculous. Avoid "Delusion" unless you are deceptive enough to believe in the misleading positive reviews here. - NOTE
