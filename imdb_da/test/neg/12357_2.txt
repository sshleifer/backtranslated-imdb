I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well, I was referred to the fact that it is an outdoor movie. I was hoping to find some beautiful sceneries, but it's the prospects where they're just limited .. They just go back and forth in the same place. I hate it when using these so-called hi-tech stuffs like this Motorola Blue-tooth headset they use to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just as fun .. they look like amateurs. And those where like to advertise the poorly designed alien-ware laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people .. I couldn't say more about this television movie. The end was bad, it seems that they cut it shortly the use of rescue helicopters and so on. * / **********
