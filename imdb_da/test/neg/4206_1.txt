Ok with this movie, there are a number of ingredients in the workplace: <br /> <br /> First, put in lots of hillbilly truckers - good ole boys who secretly want to take the law into their own hands. Second put in the evil hillbilly police controlled by a Texas bred outlaw. Third put the karate fighting trucks played by Chuck Norris. Fourth, a chump teenager like Norris nephew caught by the evil hillbilly police. Fifth show Chuck Norris is fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now everyone mixes and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre movie!
