I have vague memories of this movie that is fun. <br /> <br /> After seeing it again, I've either changed or thought about another movie altogether. It seems like we are supposed to be sympathetic to Jackie Mason's character, but nothing in the film actually gives that feeling. It is noteworthy that he is truly the only person who is given a Buddhist dialogue with his loved ones. No one else's character can rise to the status of even vigilant man. <br /> <br /> I don't even like golf, but when the film went on, I found myself really rooting for Robart Stack and club guys, really hoping they would reject Mason and Chevy Chase.
