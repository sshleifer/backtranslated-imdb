This movie is a lot of shit. It is quite disturbing to see that someone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Bad acting, bad action scenes that get really comical in the end. Excuse me, if it was a comedy, I didn't understand it. If it was, I regret laughing at the scene! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of seeing this! Good night!
