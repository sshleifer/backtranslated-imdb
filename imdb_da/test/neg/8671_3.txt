This was just broadcast here in the US. Others have commented on the belief (or lack thereof) of the novel; The 1983 version of the BBC is much better at this and all other things. In light of the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed for 85 minutes. Key sections should be hurried or referred to or omitted; there is hardly enough time to get into the chronology of the event so that character development must be sacrificed: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are, depriving us of what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br /> A major negative for me was cinematography, which I thought was just horrible and quite literally sick. The camera constantly makes ultra-closeups and swirls around in circles. Maybe on a small TV box it's OK, but on our 40 "hi-def screen, it was so literally staggering that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my drama supplies had run out). Derive me from the pretty scam, I'm just reading-what's-in-the-script play (isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). <br /> <br /> Adding the score so far in the complete JA Sweepstakes: I would rate "Northanger Abbey" a success due to superior direction and production values ​​(and the story is better for short processing), "Persuasion" OK (though not other versions, with condensation again being in error), both far ahead of this experiment. I would hope for better in the two remaining novels in this television reader Digest Jane Austen, like others, I'm grateful they left P&P alone!
