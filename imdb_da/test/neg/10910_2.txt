Some filmmakers cannot do anything wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is why you should never pay attention to them. This movie is a perfect example. Critics as director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") she takes care of in the summer and the relationships they have with some men. It's speech, speech, speech and more talk. <br /> <br /> For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titled, there are a few quick naked shots and a few difficult words, but otherwise it is a harmless French moral game. A friend of mine lent me this bond. He thought he got a sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it was so boring. <br /> <br /> Getting such good reviews is almost inconceivable.
