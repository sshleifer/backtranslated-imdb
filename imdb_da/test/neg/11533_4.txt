The only reason why any of the hundreds of users watched this movie was because they belonged to the crew, were friends to the crew, or were obsessive fans of either Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "Lance cult", so I was disappointed to see that even though it is the lead leader, it's just the name. Playing Rich Criminal Newcastle, Lance is a joy to watch, but his entire screenplay is relegated to the beginning of the movie. Newcastle creates a 747 hoist, which includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a bunch of oblivious characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not so bad. With the exception of something disgusting and rather confused, Aviva Gale looks like every time with a fine school of character playing actress, the play was decent all around, and none of the lines made me scramble. <br /> <br /> But when the hoist occurs, the movie falls asleep. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever caught on film, but it is too long drawn out. This is not a very deep movie and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring, I nodded almost at two in the afternoon. A particular order in which we look at each of the characters, performs the same task over and over again, is particularly difficult to get through. The movie's name is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from fast - it is prolonged and inflated to extremities. Perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, then there's only so much you can ask for a straight-to-video movie flight of Showtime Extreme. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a disguise hammer, which gives a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns to the end of the movie, though for a short period. It's a bad movie, and I probably don't have to tell it myself, but it's far from the worst I've ever seen. I would not put it too high on the list of Henriksen movies, since he has been in some genuine gemstones with a larger screen time, and whether the movie loses a lot of steam when the hoist begins, but the best thing I can say for the Rapid Exchange is that they Last two movies I watched before it was the regular hostage and the overrated, pretentious Crash - and it was better than both.
