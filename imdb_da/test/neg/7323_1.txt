Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and false. She is the same on and off the screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres, and she behaves exactly the same as in movies. Her stupid facial expression makes me change channels. She has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better if someone had been picked for the part. Steve Martin doesn't add much to the movie either. He over works too and also destroys an old favorite. The ridiculous part Martin Short plays only adds more idiocs to the movie. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both times they had to turn off.
