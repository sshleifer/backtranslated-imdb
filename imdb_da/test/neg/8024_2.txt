It's fun ... one day before I watched this movie, I had seen a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so comparison kind of came automatically ... of course there is no :) <br /> <br /> This movie is weak in all aspects ... plays are not convincing (especially the one playing Simona ...) and unnatural ..., editing in confused and always leaving a taste of unfinished shots, not fitting music, story not flowing, it becomes boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is ... oh, and the characters are not so well shown, you can't actually tell much about the girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shock with explicit curse (which is very ridiculous :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
