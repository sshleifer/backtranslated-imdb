Ewww! A Disney sequel that's bad! Who would have thought so? In fact, quite a lot of judgments here and they are not wrong. I actually looked forward to seeing this horrible movie based on my taste of the original. And therein lies Disney's whole "cash-in" mentality. Push out an old junk on the back of a success and people will go after it. Don't think they're so cynical? Ask yourself so .... How many Disney movies have successors? And then .... How many of these followers throw a follow-up? A significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove is just another example of this. The reason is ridiculously simplified and pulled out. Even more annoying was the increased number of out of place elements and scenes - for example, an old people's home and God forbids an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Even worse, Kronk's opposite Chippamunk leader has a completely confusing over-the-top English accent without any reason. An accent that after a very short time was strong on the nerves. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things. The animation is very nice and voice talent does well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially Warburton in the lead role. But apart from this, there is really nothing to recommend it. Of course, small children like it, but there is little to mother mother and father while sitting through this sudden killing of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you will use to avoid a pack of ravening man-eating lions.
