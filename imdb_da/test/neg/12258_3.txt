This seems to be two films spliced ​​in one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help Marjorie Woodworth's romantic life. OK: I had never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction. <br /> <br /> Before we know, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She's Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I didn't. She is no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination. <br /> <br /> The movie has some sweet moments. The first part is better, with roles for what seems to be any third party character actress working in Hollywood at that time. <br /> <br /> And what about Ms Woolworth? She sounds a bit like Betty Hutton. She sounds a bit like Marie Wilson. She is beautiful, for sure. But she is not a comedian. <br /> <br /> Pitts were often used in very small roles. Here she has the greatest role. She is always fun, even though this movie made me wonder if a little of her didn't go very far. (As a cartoon. When she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim's silents - "The Wedding March" and Greed "are the two I've seen - she was brilliant.)
