On a mission in scenic Italy, the beautiful bilingual synchronizing Lana Turner (like Fredda Barlo) meets older songs and Prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). The two fall in love while enjoying the beautiful Italian landscape. Unfortunately, Mr. Pinza away to his royal father's death bed, where he leaves Lana. Twelve years later, Ms Turner is a Los Angeles actress who has to make a movie about falling in love with a king. Turner gets romanticized by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then King Pinza comes back into his life ?? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Empire" gives a tired story to the sex symbol Turner and debut bass vocalist Pinza, who appeared for decades with the New York Metropolitan Opera. Pinza probably earned his MGM feature film career after appearing in the highly successful "South Pacific" stage production (1949). The cast album, and Pinza's golden "Some Enchanted Evening" single, sold millions. The support wheels Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds give the film an even greater sense of wasted resources. <br /> <br /> *** Mr. Empire (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
