This film had the potential to be a great movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance writer and this movie had every chance of being as big as The Notebook, but what sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is thrown away by the sinister act of Channing Tatum. I felt a lot of the scenes were unevenly clean because of his performance, a lot of emotions in various scenes are lost because he cannot act, leaving a creepy and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried only gave a great achievement to get the Tatum drop ball the mood is lost and the scene cannot recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserved to be thrown right, but what it got was a beautiful boy who can't act. Tatum must stick to what is good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible as GI JOE, step up and Fighting. The less he speaks the better. Try not to think of me as an abandoned hater of Channing Tatum. I went into this movie with an open mind, because I have been surprised many times by the likes of Adam Sandler in reign over me. I gave the same chance that Tatum did not see him here as the sum of his previous roles solely on his performance in this movie, which unfortunately was a letdown
