I work in an office at the weekend and there is a TV that only gets one channel. So I have no way to turn to something better. I do, however, because it gives a little background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I got "Breaker Breaker." The city looks like a third set of sets (which of course is). All actors and bad guys seem to have just graduated from stuntman school. I've seen better dramatic regulations in a carnival. The special effects (flames at the end of the movie are more fake than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a horrible actor ... A badly acted, poorly shot, poorly written film.
