First, the Mexican werewolf in the Texas title is misleading, as many others have pointed out. It's actually about El Chupacabra, which is a similar being to a werewolf, but by no means the same. <br /> <br /> Production and editing simply sucks. When it was over, I would probably not be able to give a very precise description of what Chupacabra looked like, because when it was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera was shaken and one could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but one must expect from a low budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Along with the horrible production comes the bad actors. Now a couple give rather plausible performances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (everyone else) who seemed to have no feelings at all when people died. Then there is the absolutely horrible actor (Sara Erikson) who gives one of the two worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean my God, she was indescribably bad. The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town that kills local residents and a group of teenagers are looking to stop it. But even with the plot being so simple, some plots of holes managed to leak through. <br /> <br /> Anyways, horrible movie. But if you're looking for a movie to have fun and laugh with your friends one night, it would be a good deal. My friends and I were happy to see this. Probably the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Terrible.
