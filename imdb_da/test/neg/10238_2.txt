Sammi Cheng & Andy Lau are again connected in their 3rd movie - YEARS DAY ENGLISH - directed by HK's actioneer Johnnie To ... fans of To's action film will be disappointed to find that no single gun was used in the movie. In addition, fans of Cheng & Louise's earlier films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to find out that YESTERDAY is not as close as fun or loving. <br /> <br /> Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) is a divorced couple ... both wealthy HK citizens ... both incredibly amazing ... both are just the case of professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather". A few years earlier, they divorced from an inability to find spaces to split the foliage ... Now she is married again to the lake for a rich heirs - a total mum's boy (Carl Ng) through and through ... The soon mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Frus.'s past and believes that she only marries her son to the family jewels - the priceless ruby ​​necklace of the goddess ... <br /> <br /> The necklaces are stolen ... is it Frus.Tos materialistic eye that gets the best of her? ... or is it her former husband, Mr. Two ways to sabotage marriage by stealing the jewels for themselves? .. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about two pple that falls in love or revives a love ... its about two pple that has always been in love but somehow has been stupid to realize it ... they let pride and greed overwhelm them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is a part caper / heist movie and some tribute to classic Hollywood glamor from its golden years - that is, Cary Grant & Grace Kelly'S GETTING A TIME ... Johnnie Two runs too heavily on Cheng / Laus chemistry from their previous movie ... hopes Cheng / Laus's huge popularity and fan base will be sufficient justification for this third movie .... I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most sympathetic / charming entertainers who work t'day ... & Lau is absolutely Tom Cruise by Asian cinema ... I really enjoyed their first two movies and consider that the Cheng / Lau mating is comparable to the classic Hollywood couples in their 40s and 50s. but yesterday much fell on expectations ... horrible writing, ridiculous situations, lots of product locations and all subplots and supporting characters were unnecessary ... came to think of it ... this movie was unnecessary ... unless you just love knowledge looks at
