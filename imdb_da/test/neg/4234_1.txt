European films may be slower and less plot-driven than American films, but it takes far too long. It also shows a whole lot of incompletely drawn characters that make inexplicable things. It's not imagination, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad. <br /> <br /> What is the message here? That people in France are pensive and look fun a lot? That they like to see other people having sex? They spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on their neck? Do not wear a watch when watching this movie, as you will be amazed at how little is explained or learned over time. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply concerned about the brutal murder of a little girl, but actually he seems disturbed before then. He is not only upset by his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally rather slow and behaves much like a learning-activated six-year-old child. He stares blankly, walks with arms stiff as a young child, speaks softly, simps, tones, behaves quite strangely in all his interactions (although no one seems to notice or care even when it should be police). He is not a troubled policeman, more of an outpatient. Picture Andy Kaufman's Latka character on Taxi but without humor. He is not only credible as a policeman, he is not credible as an adult. That he won a prize for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing - unless he played the part exactly as written and the error lies with the odd ones who wrote this thing. The reason is clearly secondary. Don't expect to see anything distant as the police would do if a little girl were found murdered. This is not so important, although the irregularity of their behavior is kind of insulting. The problem is that the rest of the movie doesn't make sense either. It leaves the long-standing close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces, etc.. The end struck me as particularly ridiculous - totally unsupported by the events leading up to it - unless you think, "What is the worst way this movie could end?" <br /> <br /> There is plenty of sex and nudity, which must mean something. Do you want vagins? You will see vaginas. Don't worry, it's art. It has deep meaning, what I'm not sure about. And the protagonist, despite his innocent marvel, seems to have some kind of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish. Finally, the subtitles in white and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read many of them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so it is not a big problem. There is also very little sound - not even the surrounding sounds you would expect to hear - in the movie that contributes to the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work. <br /> <br /> This is an award winning movie is sad. I would hate to see the losing movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
