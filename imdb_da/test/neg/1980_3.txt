I was giddy with girlish-glee when I found out this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within. After many years of expectation, the November 2005 release date. Well, November came. And went. Followed by December. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. No US release yet. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I'm so glad I had a friend with a booted subtitle. ; D <br /> <br /> Now cg was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I cringed on the unnatural movements made by the kids throughout the film. I had thought we had reached this. Also, I was really not interested in the anime look given their faces. I was under the impression that they are shooting for a realistic look to the movie, yet most of the characters have larger than the norm eyes, especially the girl figures. They had personality even though I give it to them. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of anime, I must say I was impressed by the wild battle scenes. They were animated beautifully and had me hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> For about the first two. <br /> <br /> And in there lies Advent Children's greatest mistake. It is mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized combat scenes. <br /> <br /> An FF7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a beautiful piece of cg with barely a plot to apologize for being just under two hours. Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. You do not really learn the grades. The only way you would understand most of what happened in the movie would have been if you had played the game. We hardly got to see them before they struggled with the current threat. <br /> <br /> What hurts the fans even more is the horrible cameos that the majority of FF7 characters were given. They were no more than Clouds "I call if I need you, but I probably won't" back up singers. And to add to that, each person had to throw Cloud higher and higher. This little part here was so cheesy I almost knocked it off. I would have been much more impressed if he had just jumped up on his own, ricocheting away from the walls to get up higher. <br /> <br /> It hurt even more as they reduced the Turks to less-than-comic relief. It was fine for the game, but it's cinema. People don't seem like cartoon characters in a tough battle. They removed their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And spoiler (yes right, most of you know for sure anyway). Who remembers Darth Maul being hyped up in SW: Episode 1? Yes, now, picture it, but with Sephiroth. It is true. He might have 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe that. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for the fans, then the way to go Square. If this is an indication of the direction you take the FF series, I doubt you will see many of my money. I played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters. <br /> <br /> You had a chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece flying in the face of all Disney CG movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a beautiful piece of meat with almost nothing to keep it together. Way to go. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything, but CG, they wanted to know what I'm talking about. Well, I should consider this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while correcting this, I give it 3/10 because they could have done better. They've done better. And it's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they need to restore some FFVII, they must first do this.
