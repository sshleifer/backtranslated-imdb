From all the bad comments about this movie and adding them up I feel the same. It may look as if the Australians are weak instead of being brave soldiers. In this movie it was very terrible and too graphic. I didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice, which is ashame because it's not something I read. We do not need the extremity of violence, so we can use our living imagination of what they went through. It's like saving private Ryan, where the Nazi pushes his knife slowly into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme extreme director of his films not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. Iwo Jima's letter was one of the war movies that was close enough to the story (although I could be wrong), except the flags of our fathers and the bridge of the Kwai River. It is better to read it, it is an insult to the victims and the fallen, if you do not tell it right and the film is drawing too long, there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the Aussies to kill Japanese soldiers. Just read the story on the internet, mags and in books. Film always kills sense of accomplishment. What they did for POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was just terrible for civilians. It makes me feel proud to see treats turn evil, but movies like this destroy it.
