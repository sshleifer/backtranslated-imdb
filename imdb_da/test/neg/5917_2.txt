In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and Little Rascals. Most of these films are unusual and have resisted the course of time. A lesser-known Roach product, however, was the mating of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was mated to the equally untamed Patsy Kelly). Try as I might, I just can't stand these pictures - they're just not funny. Plus, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you just think I'm a tissue, I understand that I've seen and reviewed hundreds of Roach movies as well as many other early comedies, so I'm familiar with the genre and within the genre, this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I'm right about the team is that as a lower team in Roach they got all the scripts no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and it usually turned out. <br /> <br /> In this movie, however, the team is the easiest. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more distinct plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as defense lawyer. As for Zasu, she is a totally annoying moron. NOT the lovable type of moron (such as Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and gritty person who is pushy and uncomfortable. As for Thelma, she is usually the rather gentle "straight man" and as such has little to do, but responds to Zasu's boorish behavior. The plot implies that Thelma defends a client accused of selling exploding pills. Considering that the pills are very dangerous when the lawyer asks Zasu to try to swallow one, it just seems stupid. And while they were called "pills," they were more like gigantic black blobs that were bigger than golf balls. Swallowing them only seemed to be constructed and made no sense - even for a low-brow comedy. When they find out, she has turned off the pill and it's really explosive, everyone is panicking and running like idiots until the movie ends. As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. But even for those who like the movie, there is no legitimate laugh at all! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was too generous !!
