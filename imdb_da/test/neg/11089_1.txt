Very strange, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not a little less. It is brilliant shot, but along with the performance of R. Lee Ermey is about the only redeeming aspect I found in the film, which consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part covers the basic marine training that looks at it in 2007, comes out as something I've seen a million times before in dozens of other movies and series, and it's not very poignant. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it. Borsergeanten is about the only credible character, while everyone else seems to be just cardboard cutouts. The general spectacle is confusing, and the manuscript is without anything interesting and consists of a little more than the sergeant's shout. The boys do it through their training and ends in Vietnam. Oh, and the cool weirdo shoots the sergeant (what a surprise ..), probably in the wrong belief that it was actually scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> So an hour went by and there was nothing worth noting. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the Vietnam section. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bunk scene where reporters of Stars and Stripes get bored and talk to pass the time. At first I thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they actually muttered their script lines. Then the camp is besieged. Ca. 20 Vietcong enters the camp through the main gate. Too bad for them they fall as flies because they simply go into several manned gun posts without any kind of coverage. Is it normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how has the United States not won this war during the first two months of engagement? The rest of the film continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole plot is completely unnoticed. None of the characters inspire much sympathy, and the story is honestly unmanageable. It shows a little more than some warriors associated with a platon where some guys are shot because they are disobedient morons, and who also seem to think that somehow a hole in a wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> What was the message in this movie ... that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in war situations? That if you want to dispose of really stupid people, do you send them to a war zone? Or that somehow in Vietnam can actually actually burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, Apocalypse now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
