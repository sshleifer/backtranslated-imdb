I found myself more and more angry when this film evolved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor will hit the ground. The "powers that are" do not believe in him, so he sets out to build a survival home inside a mountain for a small collection of people. Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is one of his lucky reporter for an invisible tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead in the mountains. He sits down to investigate. <br /> <br /> While trying to get into the secret survival home, Jake spends a lot of time shooting people to death or hitting them within an inch of their lives. He spends the rest of his time ticking Dr. Crawford who gave the doc the right to decide which people would survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found that Jake would make the future a great service and turn a gun on himself. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this turkey.
