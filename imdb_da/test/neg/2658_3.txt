So very good chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but each time the story of their relationship began to gather momentum, the manuscript sharpened and dealt with some irrelevant sub-plot that did nothing to advance the story. In fact, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. They were like commercial breaks where you saw the trailer for another movie. Of course, the authors (or anyone who controlled the authors) are not proud to write convincingly about relationships and the inner lives of their characters. They seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun strokes and bar battles. Or maybe they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and Dutch had been developed more and allowed to play, the authors would have known how to finish the story. This movie is a disappointment not to do more with its amazing actors who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.
