I watched this movie yesterday, and as most allrdy wrote "I also expected a Steven movie", God, I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humble. I had some doubts because I read that "Yes Rule" played in it, but hopefully I thought they gave him a slim role, so I didn't get any irritation from seeing him. And avoiding the opposite event, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what duck you're thinking of joining a sry *** crew like this. Steven was broke and needed cash? bah = (what a big disappointment. If you like Steven movies, pleaseee skip this one it's pure drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. But "act"? his buddy curated with his annoying hood talk. <br /> <br /> My beer went from tasting fresh to water, we do the dishes in. The story had nothing "good" about it, felt like a 3-year produced it "Hopefully, Steven will make me happy again in a future movie. People aren't even worth renting like that. <br /> <br /> Too bad and pitty :-)
