JP3 lacks Spielberg touch. It's an all-out attack on the senses with "in your face" dinosaurs. Watching this movie was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell. <br /> <br /> Scripture is lame; It asks at the same time and leaves too many questions unanswered. Also we don't really understand the people in the movie for all they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is a great talent to compete with dino bullies for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; in this movie she is barely a blip on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was close too. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, free violence. <br /> <br /> Words to the wise: Vote yourself away from this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated it as a 3 for special effects, I took the other 7 points out to have absolutely no originality.)
