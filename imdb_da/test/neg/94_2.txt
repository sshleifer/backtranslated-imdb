The most positive points in this movie were the credits (text style) and some moments in the Ice-Ts play. The story; Two rival gangs who have to fight with it, with treason, power and change are well-developed reasons, but in this case painful (much) to wade through. The dilapidated landscape, which added a little credibility to places and dubious lighting, was constantly distracted by interest / identification with the characters (the glare of the actor's forehead / nose was dazzling, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not even halfway into in the movie I wanted to know more about how and why it happened in contrast to what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you've seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors / actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weakness; Corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.
