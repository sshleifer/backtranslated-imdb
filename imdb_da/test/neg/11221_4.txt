I share the same statement about Underworld as the previous comment. I spent 1.5 hours in this movie and wondered what this story was about and more importantly why the author and / or director had made certain decisions. On the whole, I found the film to be unbalanced, which consisted of strange subplots, which (IMHO) actually had nothing to do with the movie. When writing a thriller, I also want to say that you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not the way the story is filmed ...
