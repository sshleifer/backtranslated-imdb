I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We had looked forward to it, but my children had not been there, my husband and I would have left. From an agricultural holding, we found the fact that all the male cattle in the film that had the udder drawn on them were a little disturbing. We felt we saw cross-cows or something. It was just odd to hear a male voice coming from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on another website, I felt that the animators might have looked up this fact. I know this is only an animated, humorous show, but by putting female body parts on a man, I had to suspend my disbelief so much that I just couldn't enjoy the movie I might have. I know that weeks can be found fun, but they were definitely over used. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have sex-specific body parts drawn on them, and I would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the right ones if they were to be pulled at all. However, the children still enjoy the film, even though we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
