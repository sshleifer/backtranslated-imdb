Why was it on the ground that Bava had to add insult to injury that made this pathetic piece of follow-up burden? <br /> <br /> We begin with the "viewers" in the home being treated with a narrative from some unknown thing -bat informing us of subsequent events of the previous episode that depict humanity's victory over the demons (yes right). <br /> <br /> I can tell you "right now" that this is not at least what - always has something to do with demons, as this is a whole new story with a different background altogether. Bava as usual, makes a casual look that doesn't even seem to fit in with the main context of the story at all. Acting in this one beyond horrible and the whole concept of the demons is shown through a television set, oh God, I will not continue. Go and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you are treated to ridiculous dubbing, crap scenarios that don't make sense and above all unanswered questions. How typical of a successor who played the first series of crap. All in all, if you are one of those DVD Argentophile collectors, then you might want to give it a try, otherwise avoid the plague, it's no way near the first, so you might avoid suffering the plague.
