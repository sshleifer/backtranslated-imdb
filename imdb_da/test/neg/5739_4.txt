This turned out to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with UK funding; Unfortunately, the result is undecided (except that it exceeds the discomfort and border struggle approach) in spite of stars and instructors. The former is led by a tree Franco Nero and an ultra-hammy Telly Savalas as a couple of wild robbers (if anyone is able to believe in either actor ?? who generally exudes cool? Like a duo of bumbling crooks, he is more I is happy than I am!). Their job "goes wrong (ends in murder and sat in the case of cutlery instead of jewels!)? The mismatched criminals, however, see an opening to their dilemma when they accidentally" kidnap "their son into a British diplomat (a miscast Lester who even get kicked-up Savalas, where it hurts at some point. Yet they never actually fix him and their only intention is to cross the border with France; taking along with them is Nero's boyfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani): soon enough she has enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping, the crazy Savalas notices this and kills her after the girl, meanwhile Nero and Lester have woken up The former thinks his accomplices might have crossed him so he goes to lamb with a boy in tow; after a short spelling on a rich old lady country estate (which includes totally free backward nudity of both Nero and Lester!), Savalas catches up with them, they continue their trek, where the trio enters a family of German campers: the situation degenerates to the point where Savalas closes them inside their trailer and throws the party in the river ?? Although he himself is badly injured in the process, it all usually ends with the 'heavies' being killed, just as they are about to reach the border. <br /> <br /> The movie therefore contains most of the genre's typical elements ?? sleaze, sadism, violence, chases (the aftermath of the opening car, when the getaway car causes chaos in the narrow alleyways of the city and even disturbs a funeral process is actually farcical), etc .; A mildly interesting aspect of this is that Lester himself is ultimately seen as definitely (irrevocably?) Characterized by the experience ?? will feel excitement when an act of violence is committed.
