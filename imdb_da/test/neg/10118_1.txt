Hm. Where do I start? I usually ignore whatever rating IMDb has when I watch a movie because I think I might like it anyway or anything and I should at least give it a try, but this time I would wish that I had noticed. <br /> <br /> I know some people liked it and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't. It was half-entertaining on some parts. But if you are like me, and you don't like watching cats that haggle in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random speed skating scenes, dog biting in the cages for another 20 minutes will be set to "exciting" music and close-ups of faces while people are talking Then you might want to avoid this movie. The actors were either positive wood or way over the top, and the film quality was horrible, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not artistic at all. And I know we should think that Carol was not just a mad man with a gun shooting innocent people with this strange religious psychosis, but ... she doesn't really convince me otherwise. In fact, I ended up really disappointing her crazy character. And what about the souls in the room? I understand this is a fantasy movie, but move on. I would say that the angel at the end was freaking spooky. It was the fateful thing in the whole movie, WAY more eerie than the Darth Maul lava-face demon. I give them props for the scene it was good. But not good enough to actually watch the movie. And the opening credits were good, but don't be fooled! I'd rather have used what the money went into the credit to make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Bah. I wish I hadn't bought this for even the $ 2 that I paid for it, I could have bought a candy bar instead. : /
