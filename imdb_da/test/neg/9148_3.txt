The positives: It's shot pretty well. Have some interesting peripheral characters. Just the main character (albeit weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: Plot / story. Editing. Draw the waste. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducing bad. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $ 12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before I move on, I just want to say that I don't like Jessica Alba - I really wanted to like her in this movie. Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model, however, makes me miserable. She has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she destroys every scene she is in. Of course, the romance does not seem credible (not even a little). All I saw was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with how little they were given - but unfortunately this whole movie is sinking. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing has been achieved. It's a pretty empty movie.
