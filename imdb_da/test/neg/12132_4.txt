1. Watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some fun scenes and good parts, but it didn't make a whole rewarding experience. John Waters instructed this music-filled spoof of the fifth stage with Johnny Depp, who played the title role. This movie is very similar to what he did with the 60's spoof called "Hairspray", but this one is not as effective. Some of the songs are eye-catching, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like manner, and the pictures are fine, but sometimes exaggerated. The story resembles the movie "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cry Baby, wow is a girl from the good group. The good girl joins the bad group, but when Cry Baby hurts her - she falls back to the good group. This just puts the end where Cry Baby is trying to win her back. Now, a difference expected in Waters film is that the bad group doesn't seem so bad all the time, and the good group seems to have a pole up on their know-what. I also saw it in Hairspray, as well. The crazy and goofiness is not really fun in this movie, and it just leaves us feeling that the movie could have been much better. The primary appeal of Johnny Depp's character is that he is able to make a tear roll down on his cheek (ie his namesake) at various times and make the women fall over for him. This is overused and the basic bottom line is that the film is ok, but not so great.
