If this is the best Commander Hamilton movie, I have no curiosity about the others. One of the film's greatest tools is his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotions, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we will admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them. Loose acting technique. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, Stormers are good at burning a gun, turning their heads away and squeezing their eyes. Look carefully. James Bond can easily compete with this. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting supporting ideas from other players, but not enough to hang a whole movie. The cinematography is beautiful and does a good job of catching the Nordic cold. Even Sahara wins up cold. Maybe Hamilton has his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> There are some good action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain who makes the hero a great pill. James Bond's jokes may not be very good, but at least he doesn't see the constipation all the time. One positive point in the film's favor is that the psychotic, distorted, evil hatred of Israel in Guillou books has been omitted. What has been held in is the worship of a noble, heroic PLO that he shows us to work in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the dictator Khaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe when Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film Hamilton PLO gives a very disturbing gift. Where should they use that gift? Hamilton doesn't care. <br /> <br /> We're a long, long way away from "For whom Bell Tolls" here. <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell well around the world, Jan Guillou will never get the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
