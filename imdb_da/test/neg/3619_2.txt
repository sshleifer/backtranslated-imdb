Snake Island is one of those movies that, while sitting and watching its stupid stupidity, makes a wish that the film camera had never been invented. The real reason why Plan 9 from outer space will stick to his honorable title Worst Film Of All Time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is. That's because it's the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Snake Island is the other kind of bad. Snake Island is just as bad, it's scary. A stupid prize combines with a script written by monkeys that dropped one-key typewriters onto transparencies which were then overlapped to resemble a dialogue to make the most obvious issues here. Filmed exclusively on the spot in South Africa, the environments where the film takes place, is about the only element that can truly be considered well thought out. Many snakes with snakes consist of close-ups, so surreal in appearance, you start to wonder if the snakes are CGI, dolls or real snakes that have been fed with very hard drugs. <br /> <br /> William Cat stars, if you can call it, as a writer traveling to an island resort on what seems to be a river ferry. Getting along with him is an assortment of very generic, poorly defined characters. It's just about random screenwriting about who survives to the end, but Cat seems to definitely consider shooting his agent. The rest of the casting seems to be from home and away the play school, where any consideration of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by open mouth and trembling in all directions. The Foley effects are often worse, with a memorable scene where a double-barrel shotgun sounds like the pretty flat sound effects that accompanied shots in such games as BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes explode continuously to each other. It would have been more accurate to call the movie Snake Holocaust. Of course, no Z-grade horror or sci-fi movie is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undressing. As every woman in cast, almost gets their clothes off, the movie begins to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst bunks, all there really is very setup in this case without any real payout. The sex scenes never allow, and the death of the character is so flat, so uninteresting that the whole movie becomes meaningless. Unless you are considering seeing that William Cat runs through a muggy forest that carries creepy cricket gear and smashes snakes in every direction with a cricket bat a payoff. To the post I do not. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst movie ever made on predators. I was so much, very wrong. At least the Anaconda had a snake you could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for a long time. Some of the snakes that have been shown to kill human molding are no bigger than the shoemakers of some pair of boots I have beaten. <br /> <br /> So far, we have the bad horror movie checklist that runs together nicely. The irrevocable, lame cast is counted on, like poor sound and visual effects. The dialogue is so miserable, so bad that I have seen better writing and delivery under some of the plays I've acted many months ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falls in this regard, the area is bad for all bad movies. In essence, it forgets to be so bad that it is fun. It is so bad that it ceases to be good after the opening credit and becomes painfully the second that the cast begins to speak. Compared to William Katt's performance in Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Cat are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this you are very pressured to say a single word naturally. Listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. A mind tends to deplete the experience, primarily as a self-defense mechanism. Because of the above-mentioned lack of entertaining bad, I gave Snake Island a two out of ten. My special movie score is so bad that they may not be good but not bad enough to entertain. It is just so boring or meaningless that you can just as well see the test pattern. The right way to spell "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
