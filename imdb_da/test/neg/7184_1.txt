I'm still not sure what the hell this movie is about. I think the boy was afraid of being blind and began to imagine all sorts of strange things. This does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother, or the relentless boredom found in this movie. While watching this movie, you wish you were blind so you didn't have to see this experiment in futility. jump over this steaming pile and choose something else in the video store ..... something else.
