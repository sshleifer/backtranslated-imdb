This show just sucks. I don't think I should even say it or why, because you judge the number of comments I already repeat everything. The keys to the vip are like turning your TV on and throwing it at you. That's exactly what I'm even not even exaggerating a little at all. These guys are so stupid, not funny and not slippery with the ladies that it is not even fun-casue-it-stupid. I sat through four episodes and I want my two hours back. where do they find the participants because they obviously lack mentally. If I was the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on TV, I would make the world a benefit and jump out of the tallest building I could find. How come waste in this way on TV? especially the comedy network should not be a show on something called the comedy network, at least be a comedy show or maybe be fun so often?
