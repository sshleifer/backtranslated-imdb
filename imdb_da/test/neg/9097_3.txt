This movie has some beautiful gorey parts like a tits getting bit off and another big bite. Castle Freak itself is a good monster. I would be afraid of pieces if he came after me. However, the film had some stupid parts about it. <br /> <br /> A man walks full and runs his 3-year-old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater harm than blindness, but you would never know that the parents actually feel bad if their daughter is blind. All they care about is that "J.J. is dead!" While their teenage daughter walks around and walks into things and talks about how she will never be able to drive. The parents are like - "darling, stop walking without guidance, you know better than that", and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. Sounds like favortism to me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue lines are not very realistic or well done. For example, when a huge crash is heard in the castle, everyone runs into the basement to see what it was. It was a large mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. The man runs to the broken mirror in horror and clearly says "mirrored bread." I don't know I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed onto the ground in my castle. The spouse has some great relationship issues and it's fun to see how stupid they are with each other. No one believes the blind girl ever. Advice: If a blind girl says she hears things, believes in her and doesn't tell her to shut up. I think it's the morality of history. Listen to people when they tell you things, otherwise you might end up killing yourself to prove your point. Finally, I thought the best character was the greatest police officer. He was the best actor and character. Everyone else (besides Castle Freak) was pretty run down by the mill. 3.10
