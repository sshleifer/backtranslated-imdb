I think it wasn't quite the filmmaker's fault though. The movie suffered from the incredibly stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who had made the role of the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger we old people grew up with) he could not wear the mask publicly. Now you think the poor guy doesn't make that much money on it, and it wasn't as if he'd take anything away from this movie, but it all seemed to be ... free. The other thing the movie suffered from (besides a leading man whose voice was so horrible that they had to overdo it) was the fact that western was not so hip in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been exposed to a decade of liberal liberal guilt about how west was built on genocide from the Indians. (That and Blazing Saddles sent up the whole genre! Campfire scene. Enough said!) Hollywood shot away from Western because Science Fiction was COOL then. <br /> <br /> The one scene that emphasized it was when rescuing the drunk president Grant (and seriously, I would have let Grant stay with the evil ones. The country would have been better!) Grant asks Tonto what his reward should be "honor your treaties with my people". Yes, right as it would!
