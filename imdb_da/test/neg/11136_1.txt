I hate movies that end like this !!!! <br /> <br /> This 16mm disaster is full of clich√©s, stereotypical characters, a generic, over-finished "plot" and horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "Movie" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian "Hacker Chick", the pedophile teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah .. .. And then Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> Do you think anyone is taking the explanation too far? " This question is put to the end of the movie. Take the mark of Scream 2 too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Typically I don't go into spoilers, but I have to race .... <br /> <br /> A dream? It was all a dream !!!!! This is the most trusted way to finish a movie. "I don't know how to explain all this and we have no more money ... Let's make it all a dream." This is what the director / producer / actor / FX guy must have thought. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. E He did almost everything on this garbage movie. It is such a clear exit. And what about the protagonist, okay, so he has done all kidnapping! What does it have to do with the movie? Of course, the black people are killed, the bitchy girl is killed, the teacher has a past with sexual harassment with the students being killed (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This movie gave me heart burn. Meaningless, meaningless and made with parents Visa and Mastercards (who tell me it's probably still being paid), this movie is stupid, boring and simply stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they presented the names, etc. In the beginning and in the end. It had an eerie sense of it. Too bad it didn't make the movie! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
