Maybe it was the big weight gain that Seagal had put on. Or maybe it was Wayans' terrible play in an action girl. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have made this spectacle nightmare. True, the story line was good. Nevertheless, his physical appearance as an avid successor to Seagal's career and background was incompatible with his genre of pure, pure and healthy Zen Buddhist life, especially in his screen discussions with Wayans. (Then again, his real life crime with the "nanny" was also inconsistent!) If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, he should do what a contributing character did in the "Kindergarten Cop" ... put humorous material or situations in the script, where the actor has no choice but to act in a comical way. Otherwise, the clever cracks and the relentless attempts at humor leave it while chasing a serial killer. Seagal is not a natural humor type guy. It did not work. <br /> <br />
