Oh God. Why is it that Nickelodeon has so much time to produce half a decent movie? I think this movie could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Rather superficial, stereotypical and insulting to some C. Finally meaningless <br /> <br /> First most of all, "dress up nerd to look cool" things very LOTS, very shallow, very pointless, and very insulting. It has the stereotypical geeks-silly faces, glasses, never kisses, vacations with his mother, etc. Well, the reason why the guy has never kissed a girl is because he is gay! Does that mean all gay people are geeks? And what's wrong with being friends with your mother? <br /> <br /> The worst, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the movie was about Zoey to find out that Chase loved her and blah, and when Chase finally decided to tell her, <br /> <br /> he didn't tell her personally, just as he was knowing that the typical distraction came past B. he tried to text her, but her PDA fell into a fountain and died before she got the message. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> HOW LAME IS THAT ????? I mean, why is it that comics just can't change something in the series? So many of us want to see these two come together. Why can't we see it? Do I mean, the producers are really so harmless that they can't think of new problems going with the series? So they have to stick to the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just use them? After a while it becomes boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see something really Romanesque here, there it is! <br /> <br /> Okay. I'm done with my rant.
