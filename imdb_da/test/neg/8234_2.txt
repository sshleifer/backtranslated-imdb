I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the movie, the more blood and gut, the better, and I really fall in love with cheaply finished flicks if they are done right. Luther starts well ... his origins in the circus, a creepy run in a supermarket, an attack by an old lady and his disturbing obsession with a woman's farm set the mood nicely. A hot sex / shower scene follows when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend come to the house. When Luther steals the love motor bus, the movie takes a turn for the worse. The characters are presented with many opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) get the police to help, C) escape or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I cannot feel empathy or fear of signs that are too stupid to help themselves. Chareter's snub chances to arm himself with guns and knives while Luther is gone. A policeman finally arrives and is just as ineffective in stopping Luther, even though at one point he has a rifle aimed at Luther, while Luther complains and makes his representation of the Polish chicken dance. I was no doubt coaching my television: "Make sure he is dead!" "Hes gone, get out of there!" Or "Just kill him already!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he's hardly Hannibal Lecter. If you can't throw this egghead, you deserve what comes to you. At halfway through the film, you become so stupid of the fate of the half-thought that only morbid curiosity will keep you able to last to the mildly fun end. This movie was listed as one of Fangoria's 101 best movies you've never seen ... Well Fangoria is half right in the case of Luther the Geek.
