I have to say that this is better than most SyFy excursions, but that doesn't say much. The reason is that someone buys a game made of bones and skin of a dead witch from Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game only to be interrupted halfway when that friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way the game predicted. <br /> What follows is a series of killings that are typical of a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. It has the puzzle at the end and the interesting part plot with the policeman who wants the game to bring his family back ... but otherwise it's just a mess.
