I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with ** SPOILERS ** joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that is not given away at the back of the box is given away in title. Maybe I'm just a close American 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it beats me, but I prefer movies that have at least some words. This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey down right chatty. This movie is just so slow, it's not even art, it's just boring. We follow this creepy guy who follows this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not make you refer back to the book, it should be able to stand alone. This movie has no way to stand. It doesn't even have a bone bone to lean on.
