Not only the title, the movie itself is also a long one, or it seems. It is because of the outdated style of acting and the pathetic way that its hackneyed themes are visualized. The bad marriages of the sick and a gay brother who dare not say the name of his sexual preference - Italy 2003, do not believe it (and you do not).
