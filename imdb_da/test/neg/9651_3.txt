I guess the movie was based on a hefty book. Considering the number of characters and under-spots during the Katyn, I thought the filmmakers, perhaps the author or director, intended to make an epic movie. But really there was not enough time to spend on the development of characters or history. Worryingly, there were many independent page stories that could have been edited. <br /> <br /> In connection with the events leading up to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think that the film explains any reason why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophically? Revenge? The interesting part of historical movies is to see personal motivations or emotions. Instead, Katyn's killers seemed to be automatic machines controlled exclusively by Stalin, which in some cases appear as a sketch. The depiction of the Russians and Germans seemed completely one-dimensional. (Are Polish people just so angry with the Russians?) Besides being poorly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, the choice of music and film did not match each other and the film itself. I don't think you can really shoot an epic war movie or war event on a handheld camera. (But if the director went with a character-driven story, perhaps focusing on a single family, the handy-cam approach might have worked better.) And if you use really dramatic music, it should be better balanced for that type of shot made .
