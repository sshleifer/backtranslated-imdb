Before I start tearing off this movie, mark - I love SCARLET PIMPERNEL. This story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie staring Jane Gray is very good and the music on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So I thought when I heard that this movie came out, it would be great as it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a faint, totally stupid story that EXPRESSLY failed to capture the beautiful story. <br /> <br /> There was no exciting flush with bold aprons. There was no deep love that made your heart flat when Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband left her again. All it had was a confusing plot and a lot of outside -blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Sink me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
