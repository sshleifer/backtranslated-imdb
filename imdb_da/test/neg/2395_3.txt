Love and human remains directed by Denys Arcand is an abysmal pathetic film, as it is quite different from the kind of film he has made throughout his career. Making another movie is not an offensive issue; it's difficult that if a movie from a master is out of tune, it's a really bad event. The film begins on a good note, as tension has been created. But as the film progresses, it is only an involuntary attempt to create something meaningful, as Arcand shows us half a dozen oddball capricious characters whose lives are interwoven. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequences here. What is even more annoying is the feeling of guilt related to the characters that are right in a correction regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality. A movie would be interesting for some who want to see another Denys Arcand movie. All in all, there would certainly not be many takers for this movie.
