Perhaps I thought a movie that boasted a cast, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig, and Harry Andrews might be worth seeing. Alas, I was wrong. Add pretentious nonsense from the beginning to the end with both O'Toole and York overactive game. I saw it twice and still have no idea what was about. I have a feeling O'Toole plays Laird by a Scottish castle who has a drinking problem and likes to relive childhood play with her sister (York). He also scolds wrong. But apart from that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redeeming function at all. I can only assume the cast and the director was extorted to do this boring, imaginative, staggy piffle. Clear waste of time for a talented cast and director. Ridiculous.
