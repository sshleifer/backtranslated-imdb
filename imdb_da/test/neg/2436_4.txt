This movie plays like an English version of an ABC after school special, with nudity. It makes you doubt about who the target audience should be. It is not as if the authors were also concerned with selling a plausible plot either. Although it possesses some watchability, Virtual Sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. It is a good movie to see if you are snowed in, the cable is out, and that is the only tape you have.
