This movie simply has no redeeming properties. The story is incomprehensible, and the manuscript is rough, sadistic and silly. The sex scenes are a joke, as it is the inevitable car fight. The music is horrible. The play is largely limited to ditch and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV to put it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people might have thrown soda on the screen.
