Oscar-recording actor Sidney Poitier of "Lilies of the Field" represents his role as lieutenant Virgil Tibbs of 1967 Oscar-winning Best Picture "In the Heat of the Night" to Veteran Director Gordon Douglas' Tired, Uninspired Successor "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs," with no one the same as Rod Steiger with switching dialogue. It was clear that both "Bullitt" scenario actor Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were out of their game when they wrote this predictable police processor pot boiler. The dialogue is boring and none of the characters are interesting, not even the main suspect. Absolutely nothing externally exciting, exciting or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In The Heat of the Night". He worked as a murder detective for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Police Department. In "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair "Changing the habit") and a family, a young rebel son Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss") and a younger doting daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell of "Hickey and Boggs" ). Tibbs runs a medium blue Mustang, and his wife stays in the house and hovers over their two children as he doesn't have that much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian's mystery. In fact, the best thing about "They Call Me MISSING Tibbs" Quincy Jones' amazing orchestra soundtrack with an unforgettable open theme, more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved. <br /> <br /> Everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne for "The Adventurers"), who was bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an invisible attacker. The apartment's craftsman Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez from "Intruder in the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet with a bloody forehead. He records the statue briefly and puts it back on the floor and reports Joy's death to the superintendent of the apartment, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill"), and Weedon gives Mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing. Then Weedon anonymously informs SFPD that the popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") beat Joy to death and seemed to leave Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") assigns Tibbs to handle the case; It seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs' wife Valerie cannot believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the film's context, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police are studying the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen' undoubtedly a controversial term to be mentioned in a film from the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tibbs question He suspected of being a drug pusher or pimp. Weedon explains that he has no records on Joy Sturges because she was inferior to the apartment from another property company. Tibbs visits the real estate company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser from "JFK") flies and drives away, mainly doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a long but exhausted pursuit. When Tibb proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allowed him with his dissatisfied wife, Marge (Norma Crane of "Penelope") to be willing to film for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment . <br /> <br /> Tibbs jumps down the man Mealie and cleans him of the crime, and then he goes after Weedon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero captures the evil Weedon in the midst of drug trafficking. One of Weedon's henchmen attacks Tibbs, but Tibbs dispenses with him shortly before he begins a long foot hunt for Weedon. Eventually he turns Weedon into an underground car park and they shoot it out. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Tibbs's household are more interesting than his study. Andy runs violently and beats his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean up his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs pops him three times on the jaw. These child rearing scenarios could never be handled today as they were back in 1970. At the end of the movie, as if to solidify the family's order, Tibbs is seen to walk away with his wife and children. There is a confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the well-being of their children and how his long hours worked. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas is competent in managing. Surprisingly, for a movie released in 1970, the filmmakers never play the flyer. In a scene when Tibbs seeks a billiard hall owned by an African American, we see a mixed race race scowling the hero as he finds Mealie and leaves with him in tow. <br /> <br /> All in all, "You Call Me MISTER Tibbs" is a poor follow-up to "In The Heat of the Night". Mind you, Poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. All the sets look fake and there is not much physical violence: an underground parking shoot that does not last long and a fight. Besides Jones' seminal jazz score, the only surprise ?? And it really doesn't qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient contrivance ?? is the end. Donald Medford's "Organization" followed "They Call Me Miss Tibbs" as the second, more action-packed sequel.
