I am a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes of this recreation I began to think it was as good as the original, but it wasn't. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister - excuse me while I was barfing. The protagonist stops in the middle of the movie for having sex that makes no sense given the situation he is in. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have said it earlier in the movie before the protagonist (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found that He is about to die and is accused of a crime, there is a reason why the sex scene is on. Early in the film, Dexter does not live fully so he is not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. that it would be more sensible that the sex scene has either been cut or earlier in the film and that the two siblings have not been lovers, one of the stupid parts of the movie involving a gun battle, a few people being killed and one person is driven everywhere within 15 meters of a crowded carnival and not yet in CARNIVAL messages! Also in the scene is tar pits university where the film takes place is built on If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a question of guilty It is not only hard to believe that things will sink so quickly in tar, but more importantly, who is building a university on tar diggers. I'd like to say more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.
