According to this filmmaking script masterpiece (saying calculated), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he introduced his theory of evolution, because he definitely did not mention any foreign interventions. For you see, foreigners sent Chupacabras to the ground, and they constitute the missing link in the theory of evolution. But the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that Chupacabras is a typical Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don't really know where it fits. Are they all Puerto Rican aliens aliens? Either way, it's still quite irrelevant anyway. All you need to remember is that "El Chupacabre" is a totally inexpensive and imbecile amateur B movie that lacks tension, character development and any style. Thousands of people are calling for this goat mousse (remotely resembling the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of a grim city. We have an untalented dogcatcher and an insidious female novelist, a couple of unpleasant cops and the suspected evil scientist with his bad accomplice. As they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly continue to devour all of the Latin American immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself looks okay, and the makeup effects on the remains of his victims are acceptably brutal and bloody. The acting performances are irreparably horrible and headaches inducing. Especially Eric Alegria is pitiable in his first and only leading role as the overly ambitious employee of Animal Control. Yes, it's an incredibly stupid movie, but you've probably fought yourself through worse and less entertaining low budget waste.
