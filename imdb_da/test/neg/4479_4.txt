The only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and fear of romance. If you expect this cinematic adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films, such as "Message in a Bottle", "Nights at Rodanthe" and "A Walk to Remember", think again. No one dies of an accident trying to save someone else, and the romance here does not transform these characters. If that is something, it makes them even more miserable than they were. A soft-talking Special Forces Army Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum at "GI Joe"), has a memorable two-week fling while on leave from the military with an impressive college girl, Savannah Curtis (brilliant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia") who use spring break in South Carolina. Savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells John that her head is full of disgrace. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall in love with each other and launch an infinite exchange letter of love letters that is sleep-inducing by any standard. Tyree is out in the world serving the military in some godly corner of the globe while she is out of college reading her letters in class. Just as they become hot and heavy between them, suicide-stricken terrorists fly into the World Trade Center. John reindeer lists with his friends in a wave of patriotism without discussing the possibility of Savannah. At the same time, another guy, shaggy but sympathetic family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") who has a motherless, autistic child named Alan becomes the subject of Savannah's feeling. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She delays what works forever before she finally contacts Tyree with the eponymous letter. In fact, she dumps him for a man with a disease! Later, she admits to John that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken his decision to marry Tim so she didn't make the fate. Predictably, John is agonizing over Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist balls in his back and wins in Germany. While all this works, Tyree tries to express himself with his own co-collecting father, Mr Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers") suffering from Asperger's syndrome. It seems his father is on his last leg after John comes out of the hospital. The leading female character lacks respect and her betrayal of Tyree is a pretty low blow. Tyree, his father and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long-distance epistle romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning to stupid love stories. Yuck!
