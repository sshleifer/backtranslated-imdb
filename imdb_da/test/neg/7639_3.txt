Lack of character development turns out to be fatal for this movie. Valeria Golino's character Grazia starts out as a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the author's fault not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: His energy and bravado are fun and compelling. I suppose the children's petty cruelty should contribute to an atmosphere of gloom and emphasize the pervasive primary spirits in the city, but for me, the gratuitous cruelty is superfluous and contributes to the film's overall boredom. Some scenes were entertaining, but not necessarily designed that way, for example, when the abused dogs turn out to be obese and healthy and look like they are ready to show. The beautiful casting and setting gives an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.
