Like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movie, this has the whole look of a "jollies" project for Robert Redford as he is going to ski uphill and down the alpine sunshine. <br /> <br /> The story is as bright as powdered snow with Redford's little town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) Who with his eyes on the Olympic glory award stands up to his coach's nose father and teammates. Women are just a side-picture in their desolate world, as evidenced by a relatively unpleasant pickup scene with an old girlfriend in her hometown, and then Camilla played her distinctive gentle pursuit of heaven over a free-thinking independent woman. Sparv. The ski sequences are fine with some good stunt work that involves many bumps and scrapes on the piste, but their effectiveness is dampened by our subsequent knowledge of top television coverage of ski events down to the present. Moreover, I am not convinced that the Olympic Games have the same mass identification with the public as the summer's game, so when Redford eventually wins the gold medal in the final, I could not really be so enthusiastic about him somehow. The editors, Redford, best profile forward, don't have to do much, and it doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with just as little material. Mrs. Sparrow does well as the greatest female interest that deals with Redford, which he undoubtedly treats every other woman in his chauvinistic way. <br /> <br /> But in truth there is a lack of dramatic excitement throughout, for which action sequences do not fully compensate and you don't care about a fig for any of the leading characters. One of the movies where the actors probably enjoyed doing it more than the viewers saw it.
