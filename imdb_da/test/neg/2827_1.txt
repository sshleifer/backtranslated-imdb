You know, I have no idea how the teenage life of others was, but it does not reflect the people I knew and associated with let alone myself. And just in case you are wondering .. No .. we were not pristine / clean cut / Pat Boone type teenagers. (If ever there was such a thing !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm NOT saying being a teen is easy. The better, indeed the best teenage movie of this time is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now the kids I knew were just as realistic as it came back then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> This was bad. This was a low-clean version of the Fast Times and even it didn't do much for me. It had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend this, or even claim "such was the case for teenagers back in 1982". I couldn't relate. The maid (girls) did nothing to me, and if they really wanted to keep their virgin, then they would not have made this film. Pure crap and a bad staple that should be left as a time capsule kiosk for teenagers / young adults in the early 80s.
