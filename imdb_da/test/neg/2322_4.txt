I'm not very much of an Abbott & Costello fan (although I enjoy "Who's On First") and to be honest there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to see more of their work. It wasn't really bad. It had some mildly fun scenes, and indeed a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, given the fame of the duo and the honor they generally held, I must say that had expected more. As the story goes, the couple stumble into a child care work, and while reading Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the child reading it to Costello), Costello's Jack falls asleep and dreams into history. There is a "Wizard Of Oz" kind of sense of the story, as the characters of the dream are all equivalents of Jack's real acquaintance, and the movie opens in black and white and changes to color during the dream sequence. The battle scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the entertaining parts of the movie. Of course, Polly also leads one of the questions in the movie - what happened to her? Jack and gang apparently left her in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Still - I wondered. There were also a few sweet song and dance routines. My 4 year old giggled a little under this, so she was able to appreciate something of humor. I found it to be an acceptable timewaster, but certainly not something that would convince you of Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 4.10
