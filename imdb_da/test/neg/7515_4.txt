Having not read the original book or seen the previous movie, and actually did not know anything about the story of one or the current movie, I came to this movie with an open mind. It's really hard to know where to start a comment on the movie because it all seems so confused. It looks as if there is a point or message or something in the movie, but what remains is unclear. The effects were amazing and very doomed. The idea was created very well with the motivation for time travel clearly prepared. But it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> The entire journey time seems to have only the watchful connection to the task being exhibited at the start. There are some good ideas, but they seem to be isolated events that really do not flow and make the movie seem incoherent and lost. At one point, one wonders whether the main film in the film is the fate of the moon. When Hartdegen arrives at 802,701 AD, the movie becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to detect anything important about Eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out what it is is, it remains annoyingly evasive. This is a strange change from previous travel cases and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned to what seems like a whole new story. So many things happen that there must be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really wanted to know what the movie was "coming on", what was uncovering, but to no avail. After reading a summary of what happens in the book at this time, it seems that there has been a very half-hearted attempt to do this in the movie, but it has been so simplified and "stupid" that the meaning and the context is completely lost. <br /> <br /> Just as we hope we will finally discover where this is leading, the movie suddenly takes another important direction change and becomes a thoughtless action movie without any real action. It is as if the director has just quit generating some meaning in the movie. At the moment, countless important things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and suddenly he loses all interest in time travel without reason. The film comes to an abrupt end when Hartdegen decides to stay with Eloi. <br /> <br /> In summary, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before they arrive at Eloi. But the worst part of the movie is what I think is the most important part: the layout of the situation with Eloi. The whole point is completely missed and this undermines the rest of the movie. After that, the film concentrates too much on effects and action, and all attempts to return to the meaning of the movie and the core seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the movie just seems to be lost and lose direction. The finale that Hartdegen decides that he is no longer bothered by time travel is the most inexplicable to everyone. In the end, the whole movie seemed to be a collection of unfinished events. The meaning and the coherence were lost, even though the hole where it should have been very clear. What was so frustrating about it all was that there was so much potential here: it was not in any way a bad movie, it could just as easily have been so much better. The start was very promising, the journey so amazing and would have worked if it hadn't gone on keyboard, and the Hartdegen's experience with Eloi could have so easily worked if a few of the right questions had been asked and had not been so temptation to "stupid" and simplify. I just wished I had a time machine so I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes made.
