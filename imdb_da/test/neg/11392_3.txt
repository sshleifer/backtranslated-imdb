This strange little movie begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that does not have friends and is beaten up every day. He likes to wear dresses and his overweight mother Angela, a dressmaker, does not think they are wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but is ignored, and as the two return to their car, they are harassed by the other children and pelted with eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by the fact that his son is a sissy and almost rejects him. Bruno meets a new student at the school named Shawniqua (Kiami Davael), who is free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with cap guns. Angela has a heart attack, and Bruno's grandmother enters to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very hard and unsympathetic look on all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno wearing dresses when she practically encourages him. Dino was told when he was a young boy with his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school in which Bruno participates is very uneasy and all the children run violently and even call the Shawniqua "N" word. When Shirley MacLaine enters the film shift and becomes more family oriented (so to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The end after the spelling bit is incredibly designed and "feels good". Hugs and cheers to Bruno as journalists follow him and take his picture to their papers. Still, Shirley MacLaine seems like the "hard old broad" like snaps at all. There is one thing about MacLaine's character in the movie that no one has mentioned in these comments and it has to do with her masculinity. I think Helen's character can be a lesbian! She is very hard and strong, and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I can't remember anyone in the movie mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married! That's why I think her character can be gay. Lots of other good actors are also featured in the movie. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan should have taken a better look at the script before logging on. I guess when they heard that MacLaine was targeting it would be an honor to be part of it. Very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding of any of the characters and the subject is probably impossible for most people to relate to. The actors are not bad, but what does MacLaine aim for? Tolerance to a young boy who wants to wear dresses and free speech? We get it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I didn't try to crawl.
