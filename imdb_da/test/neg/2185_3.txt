This movie starts at A and never reaches up to B. Its title promises far more than the movie delivers. It is superficial and filled with the usual clich√©s of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. People are comfortable, even the obligatory flamboyant type. The management (Kevin McKidd) oversees to the extent that there is a reason he is acting at all. Simon Callow, playing a horny one, is always worth seeing and he is by far the only reason to stay with the movie. But nonsense about his men's group "meditations" or whatever they are, grows extremely tiring in short order. They seem to have been thrown into the movie's gentle mix in a misguided effort to vary the attitude and non-stop inaction. The same comment applies to a truly strange and unconvincing camping trip. Don't worry about stopping the tape so you can have a snack. Let it run; You will not miss anything. Hugo Weaving's character is superfluous. He appears in a sequence with one of the smaller leaders and not even the rest at all. The result of this order is not explained, and Hugo's real estate business has nothing to do with history. The movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no solution. The case simply disappears and we are sent to the final credits. This is an interlude without structure.
