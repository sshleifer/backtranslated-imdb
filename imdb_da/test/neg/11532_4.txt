I found this to be a watchable all, be it the highly predictable movie. There was some good stunt work that gave a fair amount of excitement and excitement to the story. However, one had to suspend his credibility on a number of occasions to be allowed to work. For example, despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and braces when the pilot pulled the undercarriage manually, they luckily found an extra aboard the aircraft complete with Caribbeans. According to plot drilling, a hole in the vault ceiling would interrupt the alarm system in the vault as the system was re-activated (I can't think of why), according to Daltry, the battery-powered drill would not be able to drill through the vault ceiling, but they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally good outlet points in the hydraulic system on the planes that lie above the arch. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this could be achieved without affecting the control system or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. By accepting this for the sake of the plot, it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (voltage they will be able to drill through before the FED is there to control the false alarm), but from the time the vault door closed and before the FEDs had gone the few feet to the second security door, they had cut a burst hole in the roof of the wire which was large enough to pass through. One can accept all dissertations and other inconsistencies for a good yarn sake, but what spoiled the movie for me was what seems to have been an effort by the scriptwriters to discuss what until then was a pretty predictable ending, the Ketchum & Brooks became shot and thrown out of a 747 by 10,000 feet, the other would slide down the cable between the two planes which the villain Daltry with one hand manages to remove the cable carrying the weight of a full-grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per head. hour, pushing him and letting him fall to his death. And yet in the next order, these two, without any explanation (but obscene or unlikely) miraculously survived from 10,000 feet and had time to create a cautious scam to get the money. The only comment on the survival was that Sophie, that her brother is a bad shot. Don't expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
