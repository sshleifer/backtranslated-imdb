Lois Weber's movie "Hypocrites" was and still is a very bold and bold movie. I enjoyed it and was very impressed with the movie and the story of it. The priest sees hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are terrible when he reveals the naked statue depicting the truth after they have not led them to it, and the few who did it help on the way. The people will not face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows them to put things to God, go to beach parties that act inappropriately, their materialistic ways, and other things where the world's population does, tend not to Be morally right. Finally, he must not enter the gates of heaven alone if he does not receive any followers. This movie seems to be very brave, in the fact that a nude woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the period during which this film was made. Imagery and symbolism depicted in this movie I found incredible. The way they made the naked woman transparent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows much creativity and art. Showing the various sins of the people as they went down the road and refusing to follow the path, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was a good way to represent the people today. This film does a very good job of getting the moral message across the audience. Lois Weber has a great way to catch the attention of her spectators with her creativity, symbolism, visuals and through auditory. Even the piano's music throughout this film is very beautiful and appropriate with the whole theme.
