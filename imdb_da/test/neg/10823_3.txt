I rented this movie from Blockbust because of Cover and Title! Sounded exciting !! This movie was due to the writing, it needed more excitement. "Monsters" needed more face time. We needed them to have some kind of power and definitely more "Oh Sh--" moments. The photograph did not disturb me except for the scene where a blow-up blows up. There were too many close-ups. But apart from that, the film seemed to pull, and the heroes did not really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say that everyone puts a lot of time on the authors themselves. But this movie is definitely a below average rent. There are definitely better choices. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 over this choice.
