Detective Dave Robicheaux tries to connect the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation, Robicheaux entered a series of surrealistic meetings with a troop of Confederate soldiers, which terrible plot and it was worse than I expected. It was really slow and had minimal skill in the play I couldn't see through it was a waste of my time. Another FLOP I would give it under 1 if I could please people didn't waste your time its 1:42m full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend run under the influence. When Dave takes Elod to the station, actor Dave tells him he has found some skeletal remains while he is on a movie he is filming
