This movie had all the possibilities and makings of a good feeling good, great love story ... the casting is perfect, the work of the picture, the original premise works, the characters work .... but the story moves from one chess movement to the next in a most predictable way ... not a character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones character is that she is obsessed with her world .... no one is allowed in and no one challenges her world ... so much is obvious .... but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions really never explored or postponed .... Aaron Eckhart's character had so much more to offer the story, but it was not allowed, Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across something predictable and false .... The end goes back to the forced turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, which the audience never quite fall into .... Actually, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish, self-obsessed, spoiled lady as most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world. The director needed to make her a hero and never .... in the end it is Eckhart's character that ultimately wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> Not a miserable movie, just a movie that could have been much better with more depth of personalities allowed in, explained and postponed.
