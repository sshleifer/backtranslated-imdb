Okay, let's see ... a beautiful young stranger is new in town and walks around the local boardwalk. He meets a beautiful girl, meets up with the unpleasant head of the local hip-young vampire club, killed by them to follow them into this hole, enters a conflict over the beautiful girl, an epic battle follows ... < br /> <br /> No, it's not Lost Boys, even though you would be very pressured to tell the difference as I think even some of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) Even the end of this stink bomb is ripped off from Lost Boys. Make-up is under par, even for a low budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just how many "Oh, I had this horrible experience" scenes of teen anxiety require a movie? Humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is unfortunately predictable. Grass. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a successor, an idea hopefully every distributor in the country will drive through.
