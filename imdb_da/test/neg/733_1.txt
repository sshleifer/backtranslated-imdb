I saw "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I wanted to tell you that I remember it in detail; What I remember most alive is the annoyance it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not just my time and money invested in watching the movie, but also the director's. <br /> <br /> Presumably, "Fuckland" is a critic of Argentines who presents us (I am also Argentinian) as small people who take credit for and even boast of petty ridiculous victories and believe we are the best things that God (who is also an Argentine) created. I don't want to argue for that. It is certainly a true statement about a fairly large proportion of the population (the part I despise, by the way). And although it wasn't true, it's not my point. The worst mind "Fuckland" committed to expressing such a statement on its own director. <br /> <br /> The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us to sneak a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even mediocre) movie. Many of those taking a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to appear with a silly version of old war recordings and his own. And there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film proudly presents a Dogma certificate before the opening titles, to only respect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director of the credits - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentine, but as a guard. I felt undervalued. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
