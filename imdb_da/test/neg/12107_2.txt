One can only sit in complete amazement at this mess of a movie and be entertained at some of the ravens people have given it to. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to think about whether it's black comedy, farce or a combination of both. It winds everywhere in the direction of direction and has some very embarrassing performances that may be better suited to poor sitcom. What a shame to see the talented Dianne Wiest's comic talents scattered and the always annoying Jane Birkin is so over the top that she is more annoying than usual. Perhaps much of the positive criticism is due to the nature of "quirky French" film - therefore it is labeled "smart" or "genius". Nor is it. Instead, it's a bad move that leaves a pretty rancid aftertaste. Merchant-Ivory should stick to the serious things they certainly have no understanding of comedy.
