I expected much more from this movie than what I actually got. The action was just awful from everyone, and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I didn't even have to follow what went, because it was so jumping. An example of the play is when Paxton's character, Water, is disturbed by the South Vietnamese Colonel, so he throws some of the sand off the "sand card". It was impossible to get any idea what he felt and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea how to feel about Water. He is obviously presented as the main character, but as soon as he arrives in Vietnam, he starts an affair with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the movie was going to was that it wasn't particularly boring. I give it 4 stars out of 10.
