I even though this movie was okay. I don't think it was amazing. It was a little too slow for my taste. Lots of drama, but not so much action until close to the end of the movie. This movie was basically a dramatic movie, with the payout if you can call it that, not until the end. To me, the shadow of the shadows and the water that flooded the city were okay, but too short. The movie itself is finished okay, the play is decent, but it didn't make me long-term. Thought it had something to do with the fact that there was very little excitement or excitement built throughout the movie. . The second factor is that I just recently saw '10 .5 'and its successor '10 .5: Apocalypse.these are 2 big budget' event films which, in my opinion, are a very difficult act to follow in special effects and scenes of destruction.as a result i have to judge Killer Flood: Day the Damn Broke on 4/10
