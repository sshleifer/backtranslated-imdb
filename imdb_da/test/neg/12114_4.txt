Sure, this movie was retarded. But you expected the moment you looked at the cover. It's a B-movie, and on the T&A factor, this movie is delivered. Truly, it was more fun than expected. Although it was not a comical brilliant work, such as "Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", as far as B movies go, it was worth looking at if you are in that kind of thing anyway. <br /> <br /> Christian and morally oriented parenting groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. If you don't want your kids to see sexual content and nudity, then keep your kids away from this movie.
