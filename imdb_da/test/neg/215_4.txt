A new guard in the armored truck is recruited by his colleagues to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so nobody will get hurt, right? Of course, it goes wrong, and the new guard decides to have a conscience and do things by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I admit I didn't have any interest in this movie, but I didn't have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox, and that movie made my top ten of the year. Armored is even more disappointing when I thought it would be. As a heist film, it fails to deliver the goods, it is dull and full of plot holes and jumps in logic that one will make oneself think of it. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, the movie has somehow a really good throw, but the film doesn't even use this to its advantage. Everyone seems to be wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience feel like giving a shed. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the hoist and he first plays Mr. Nice Guy, so when things don't go, he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive cast is Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros. Not of them do much, and when they actually do something, it is without much justification behind it. <br /> <br /> The movie is relatively short, but even though it runs for less than 90 minutes, it felt dragged out. How long can you make a movie about a guy caught somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more limited. The bursts of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have is check-in every hour or so? The whole plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks in an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Try to get here and burn the trucks. They wanted to go away with the money. Of course, something goes wrong or there would be no movie right? Through a number of unfortunate incidents, the so-called completely trapped inside the truck with a vulnerable officer. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to enter. How much exciting. The scripture requires our hero to have financial problems he can lose his house, which would make him lose his brother. You see, both of their parents died, and it's just the two people looking out for each other. So now he has a reason to join the hoist. At first, he didn't want to, but his money problems are just the right push to throw him in the thick of things. How practical. <br /> <br /> The entire spin of the armor of the heist genre is that it is from an armored truck, from the guys driving it. Following the basic premise, the film falls flat on the face. I found that it would end faster and sooner every time someone spoke. Talking about the end sucks it. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
