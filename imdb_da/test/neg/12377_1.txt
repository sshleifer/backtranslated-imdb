I wish I could have voted this movie a ten, it's so much fun. If they had decided to be so funny, I'd have given it a ten. I'll give it a 1, but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever see. Watch the huge blur flash over the screen! Where did it come from? What is it? It flies, the horrors it is electrifying, it's on strings! This bird has real personality. I was about ten when I saw it for the first time, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesam Street, I was sure they were one and the same!
