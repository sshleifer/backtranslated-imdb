NBC had the opportunity to make a strong religious epic in line with the Ten Commandments and the greatest story ever told, and instead chose to make a half-hearted comic book that was more like "Waterworld" than anything else. I do not remember a Bible passage where Lot becomes a pirate and attacks the ark, nor can I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember that Noah is a crazy old wage that Suddenly he seems to be commanding a naval fleet and running around shouting nautical terms as "hoisted on the pillars!" This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. It was clear that most people who looked at this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why on earth does the film so offensive to them? If they intentionally attempt to offend why not advertise it that way and at least coil in the right audience? I hope they make a REAL Noah movie someday, one made seriously and thoughtfully, one that actually appeals to people and makes money. Until then, don't waste your time with this bin.
