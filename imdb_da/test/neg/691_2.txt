This was the worst Wrestlemania in history. The only good games were Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez, and the title title match between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this one is adjacent to the classic). Everything else was either poor or terrible. The idea of ​​having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing and shaken up in floating ways. The celebrity guests were horrible at comments, especially Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the mid 80s WWF, you are better off hiring or buying Wrestlemania 3 or just about other PPVs fabric.
