Apart from the beautiful picture thanks to the New Zealand film photographer Alun Bollinger, this movie is not worth seeing. The storylin is so fragmented and lost that it is difficult to know what is going on at a given time, and just when you think you follow, the direction changes again as a lost bi-polar puppy dog. <br /> <br /> The musical score is horrible, and depends too much on extremely emotional pieces trying to force the audience to feel a certain way as if the instruments acted as emotions in the dressage ?? "feel sad here"; "shocked here"; 'feel scared here'. In addition, the repeated samples used over and over leave the audience on the edge of laughter. <br /> <br /> Gone are quiet movie days where musical instruments were the only portrayal of voice ?? but you wouldn't believe it while watching the River Queen. <br /> <br /> The voice was so overused that one has to ask if this movie really needed an accompanying picture. It could easily have been a radio game, although it would even be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the stolen ideas from Jane Campion's piano are too obvious to overlook. Not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano ?? maybe some of this comes to Alun Bollinger's camera work on the latter ?? But also the voice-over feeling and the levels are strikingly dense. And who could forget when Holly Hunter's character has her wings cut, in the shape of the index finger cut off by Sam Neill. Is it reminiscent of when Wiremu has his 'trigger finger' amputated, and surprisingly also with an ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't recommend this movie for viewing unless you use some ear tags and just go with nature in mind.
