For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love for movies - and especially of horror cinema. The reviews I have written so far have been for movies that I love, respect and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing acclaim and perfect-ten reviews. A lifelong horror movie fan is a great pleasure for me to share with my thoughts and ideas about big horror movies and hopefully get a hand in exposing people to movies they might not otherwise seek. I first started browsing for movies to IMDB, and it was my original intention to focus only on my personal favorites and examine those that I believe are significant and lasting for the horror genre. However, the existence of films such as "Graduation Day" without purses, is a thorn in my side. Absolutely devoid of any kind of profit, this hodgepodge of undeveloped ideas in 1981 has been amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and in all respects an eerie embarrassment to the horror cinema. During the short few years before and after the release of this movie, we saw the appearance of domestic (and Canadian) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine," " The Prowler, "Just Before Dawn", "Final Exam" and "Hell Night" among others. These films, although of varying degrees of quality, strived to achieve something in the form of storyline, plot, action, direction and overall tone. Not all movies released during this wonderful season by Slasher Era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th", but these films were all well-meaning and clear contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. "Graduation Day", a monstrous farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by Herb Freed, which one only hopes will never again try to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. The task of creating worthy horror movies is best left to those who have a true love and respect for the genre. This movie fails scary at all sorts of levels, not least where there are terrible tree layouts, dime-great special effects, an annoying musical score, and most of all, a story lacks even the smallest tip of excitement or excitement. A pointless exercise on how to waste film, "Graduation Day" is a complete disgrace to the horror cinema.
