As you can read, the only good comment to this movie is made by someone who actually sees it in his church! <br /> <br /> Anyway, movies had a good B movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining, easy-to-watch movie, so felt everything in this religious Jesus-will-rescue-all brainwashing mode . <br /> <br /> The story starts with 2 protagonists, 2 journalists, but it quickly gives the first role that Jesus freaker who is there to save everyone's soul with this posture. <br /> <br /> In a few words: This movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes. Waste of time, waste of money ... AVOID IT
