Not the best of the WIP, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty of laughing at this movie considering that it had to be a career leg for everyone involved. But the play, the dialogue, the prominent scenarios and the ever-present boom microphone come to me every time and add to its bad movie charm. So much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors go to Sybil Danning. Also special kudos for Henry Silva, who is the only one in the cast who does not play his role too seriously. Look now, the movie now, makes me look more closely at Stella Stevens character. She plays the chief officer and I have to wonder about this when Hilary Clinton decided to adopt her current look and behavior. I'm sure she didn't have to look beyond her husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I judge. I have seen it several times myself and it all makes me wonder what would have happened if Mr. Clinton was allowed to install a whirlpool in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
