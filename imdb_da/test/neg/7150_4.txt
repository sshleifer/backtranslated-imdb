Everything that this movie was trying to do was made better - and excellent in "Run Lola Run". The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the critical deadline (s), The Lover in danger and the message "Crime Pays-Sometimes". BUT, unlike "Lola" it just isn't credible or well put together. It is an unemployed knock off who could have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but it compares. Yes! The falling beetle was nice! But it was about the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Real McCoy - (and the real hip Red Head!) - in Run Lola Run!
