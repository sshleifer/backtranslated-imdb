The director doesn't know what to do with a camera ... too many options, and she always chooses the wrong one ... she lets travolta charge ... and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end ... The characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to see them sing ... no pace at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... miscasted: travolta OK ... johansson, she is too adult to be an 18 ... even though she really is 20 ... the happy ending? well it seems to be one so the story is sad, but not too sad ... travolta does not know how to play a guitar, but the director does not look, she cares too much that he is completely out of sync ... the idea is the only thing that is fantastic ... but how has she developed it? Well, it's simply filled with stereotypes and lines heard too many times ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another missed chance ...
