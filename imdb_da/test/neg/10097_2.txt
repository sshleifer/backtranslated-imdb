Eric Robert's "stars" in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison movie. He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. Although it is a pity for most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy who is good enough to give you supportive wires while hanging in the ceiling when he tortures you with "Lethal Weapon" electric prods. <br /> <br /> The movie has an intricate plot on jail corruption that doesn't make sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's squinter eyes, Dolph Lundgren's one-liners, JCVD's capabilities and the body of the smallest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the movie it is hard to know whether Kove's character should be full for the whole movie or if Kove just came that way. I couldn't blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Luckily for everyone involved, this movie has a "so bad it's good" quality that can be fun if you absolutely have nothing better to do.
