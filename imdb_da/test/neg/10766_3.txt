As one who has read all Baroness Orcy's books and seen most of the films based on them, I have to say that the 1980 version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was better than this. It was better written and attached more to the spirit of history than this, which seemed to go out of its way of involving people to be shot. This new fitting is less light-hearted, but it doesn't have much depth either. Although there are some good actors, the actors did not have much to do with. Nice costumes, though.
