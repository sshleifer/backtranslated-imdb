I guess the people who speak up on this drive are leaders of the director or something. This is bad and not in the Michael Jackson song kind. Comparing the pacing of this film to the progress of a snail would be to insult the snail. This movie suffers for what seems like an eternity, all to introduce us to some un-scary zombie kids with stupid makeup and a kind of vendetta or thirst for blood or anything. Trust me, you don't care. The idea alone that mother would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and filthy home is absurd. And worse, I simply didn't find myself caring. Backstory about the zombie kids? Snore. Eradication of mother and / or daughters? Do not care. <br /> In short, WOW was boring. Do not want to.
