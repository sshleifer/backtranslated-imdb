If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see a precise Biblical (or Torah) depiction of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed with this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who have not even been "created" in the Bible are supporting characters and playing a major role in the movie. Jethro's role is completely changed, and he becomes only a motionless father-in-law instead of a shepherd who gave Moses excellent counsel. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead, viewers get the impression that Moses had to find things for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This movie is a typical humanist twist on biblical things and tries to put most of the responsibility on Moses to try to understand what God wants and what he needs to do. Those who know the book of Exodus well will not only see inconsistencies in the film, but direct sharp changes in the events. Most importantly, they will see an almost complete absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines everything Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as portrayed in the film, Moses is led by God with detailed and direct communication. Even hallmark apparently cannot recognize God's direct role, and without his spoken words to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. For example, God plagues the gold calf people and they have to look at a symbol of a snake to live. Hallmark creates a civil war instead, and the Israelites choose sides and are then slaughtered. Of course, Moses' side wins. <br /> <br /> There may be minimal value in this movie of disbelief, as it may cause them to seek answers, but believers must stay away. The winding events and changes make it a danger to anyone who does not know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
