And I can be generous. The overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped pictures ... shambling monster, two women exercising, shambling monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, shambling monster again, no worse for wear despite being wounded. .you get the picture I prevented myself from shouting "NEVER GO WITH IT" on several occasions. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that the footage they used was badly produced. The sound is disturbing out of sync with the picture. And in one scene, where they were trying to become "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the light man holding the flashlight only giving the scene's only illumination is clearly visible in the shot. The hope is that the production was the victim of a terrible disaster where the original soundtrack and most images were destroyed, but they decided to release it anyway, paved from the editing floor in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save it * real * movies - one with the plot and the interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this, and I am forced to conclude that in the immortal words of Joel and Bots, they just did not care. <br /> <br />
