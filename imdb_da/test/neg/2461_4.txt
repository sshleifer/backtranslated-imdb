It's about as pretentious a movie as a low director as Joel Schumacher could do, I assume. A group of medical students take it to die for several minutes; by revival, they discover that their sins have manifested themselves in some way. As some of the characters are visited by dead people, and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences, it is not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions seem to resemble the sixth form of art. Why students treat their experiment as a kind of grand journey that will make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are quite impossible and, as the film mentions several times, has been documented many times before. However, it is fun to see that Schumacher practices his Batman trainwrecks with some of the old neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a plank.
