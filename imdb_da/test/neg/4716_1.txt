I swear I had never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste is. Not only because it just doesn't make sense, is a great piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me beat. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish Apocada has a similar pronunciation to "apocado", which means "out of life and happiness") here makes a one man movie movie think he is Sam Raimi or the boys who directed Blair Witch project. This is the Blair Kittie project, with an expensive low budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a couple of American filmmakers going to Africa to make a Half Caste documentary, just makes no sense. The movie, which sets high-speed strokes with slow-motion shots, just upgrades your stomach more than the stupid lines (what the hell is the dialogue about Bestiality?) Or the lame performances. By the way, I don't think this cast (or caste?) Is American, they all look European to me. <br /> <br /> To conclude, you just say the filmmakers made an intelligent move to sell movies. They make a false prize performance (like most original films) and a good cover (in Spain, the lid had half-cast the picture negatively), so I now feel dissatisfied because I can't claim my 14 euros back.
