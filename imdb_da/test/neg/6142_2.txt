My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show sucks very officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I don't know, in the other CSIs you come into the episode you see. But in this one you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion this show is not worth seeing. I know people have different opinions and I respect it, but for me this CSI is not good enough. So if you like excitement, real acting / performance, good plot, direction, character development / attachment and a generally good show, I suggest you see CSI Miami.
