... Or better yet, see Fandango if you want to see a truly intelligent and fun male school age flip. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact the guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's pretty attentive), but I'm very quickly forwarded through it. Usually, road trip movies have good music, but I can't even remember if there was music. The only highlight was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, the jokes and timing missed all the way through. The four main characters are unknown actors, and I can't remember seeing any of them in another movie. (Oh yeah, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he's in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is about as much fun as watching another rocky when you are not.
