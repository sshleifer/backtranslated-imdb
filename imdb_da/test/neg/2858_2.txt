I was really disappointed after seeing Pinocchio's Revenge the second night. I had a good propensity that it would be a bad one, but I didn't think it would be as bad as it turned out. A wooden mug of a murdered boy falls into the hands of a lawyer's eight-year-old daughter. From there, it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl. We have seen movies like this before, ie. Child's Play series, which by the way is far better. However, it was good to see actors such as James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both have worked under Kevin Tenney before. In any case, I encourage viewers to check "Night of the Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that tend to bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
