I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a bad script and badly traded echo of the people I know. Great moments between characters ?? including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together ?? was often destroyed by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble upon. Beautiful and bad phrases rattled away from Lawrence, especially as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit with beer boxes. <br /> <br /> When you watch movies with Maori actors, I have found that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With the Evening Earth I fought to find a key figure that was true for the whole two hours. Most ?? including Wiremu and Point ?? quit saying or doing things that I didn't understand and couldn't connect with. At the end of the film, the author had succeeded in alienating the audience, where Maori could not relate to it, and Pakeha was therefore allowed to reject it. My feeling is that the film's message ?? or at least the most important of several who were lobbed on the audience ?? is important enough to avoid using the character's extremities. Unfortunately, no one who read the manuscript before it was filmed believed to pass this advice on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and as annoying as the horrible `bing-bong 'noise they were talking through' Eyes Wide Shut '. The audience was not so subtly auto-cued to laugh, cry or be angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entry music in Star Wars: obvious and mildly fun. I think there are some people out there who can enjoy this movie. It's fun in parts, has a lot of action and has some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also hit jobs at work. As a whole, however, I have not experienced the experience as much as I know I should have. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, the island of Dr Moreau and Crooked Earth look as if they are Tems quartet of shed.
