For native Mongolian speakers, the film lacked emotion and weight. Used for many non native speakers, especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from the actual story. Terribly horrible subtitle !!! I wonder where and who made that subtitle. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitles were in Thai if the English subtitle was soooo bad! Described one of the greatest leaders' lives very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budgets from the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the film critics of the Academy Award are so mild or what? Only good thing was some good CGIs in some combat situations only moderate ... not over the top CGI
