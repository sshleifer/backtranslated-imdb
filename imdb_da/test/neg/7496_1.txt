I was ready for a Crouching Tiger movie, and all I got was the worst movie I've seen this year. It was almost as bad as the Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Dead acting. Dead everything. <br /> <br /> Granted there were some good fighting scenes, but the positive side ends there. If this movie arrives in your house, screming for a phone and calling 911 and saying, "Please help, there is a movie in my house to force people to commit suicide"
