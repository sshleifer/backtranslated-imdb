Let me first say if you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since the blood sport, you probably won't like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors, but I enjoy these kind of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have been thinking of putting out for the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the film is only worth watching at Van Damme fans. It's not as good as the Wake of Death (which I highly recommend to anyone of van Damme) or in hell, but in my opinion it's worth seeing. It has the same kind of sensation as nowhere to run. Good fun stuff!
