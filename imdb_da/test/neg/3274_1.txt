My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were left on the floor. The funniest line is that the movie is "not something with state." So yet this is filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this movie is that the main character (not named on the box because Bolo brings more clout) is supposed to be a police detective ... a great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible Porsche. I need a copy of this, preferably the director's cut, so I can see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene he's in is the beginning when they are in the dance club. He got the place because he dated this cheerleader from a semi-pro football team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. It's interesting because his name comes up as the first entry in IMDb. Fame has him, luck, not so much.
