It's terrible, you just couldn't believe it. The score is annoying, the film is bad, for example, there is shadow of the cameraman appearing on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is ultra bad, looks like it was made in the 20s. It's terrible. There is little blood in the beginning and through the film, but always too dark. No doing no effects. The director did something better like Blood Rites. But in addition, there is a successor of the man, to seek to find this cheap flick is not that difficult, but you have to pay hard earned money for it. It will probably come in my top ten of the worst horrormovies ever, I don't know if I would call it horror. There is too much to talk about, you will have blood thirst after seeing it
