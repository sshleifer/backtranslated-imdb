Hmmmmmmm - cheerleader massacre. Let me think - high school girls are cut up, except the sweet survive. Understood. Next movie. I was actually surprised this was made in 2003. I really thought they stopped doing these movies in the 80s. This was really your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy, stupid male horn dogs, even more stupid male adult and hot teacher. It continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods. We've seen it all before. <br /> <br /> But one had a few interesting plot twists that put it over the normal me-too slashers, so if you've got some brain cells to roast and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.
