Carlos Mencia just plain is not fun! His show is painful to watch because of it. His sketches / parodies are all very horrible, and it just feels like a filler to the Chapelle Show, which, although I'm not a big fan of it, is much more fun than this bin. Carlos Mencia gives the silly speeches and he is all too often dependent on ending his monologues with a delayed voice and going "there, there." It's just not fun. He often speaks when he speaks to others, saying. They are terrible and painful. When people don't laugh, he blames them ... why should anyone laugh, he's not fun. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it is amazing that everyone with 3-year-olds looks at this. One of my least favorite things he does is water down on every subject and make it seem like a joke! I hope this racist idiot will be taken out of the air as soon as possible, because he is jumping down a station that doesn't have to be stupid anymore.
