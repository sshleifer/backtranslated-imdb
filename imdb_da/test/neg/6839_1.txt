Laughably awful. You might think that all the big actors involved in this movie would at least make it credible, but they don't - this is a stinker. The characters sprint either without having a good reason to know where they are going or they are about to make constipated faces when they have to run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain functions at the door if you are going to try to watch this movie. Or get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this a "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. That's what I did through the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And don't confuse it with the excellent movie "The Jackal Day", a much better thriller from 30 years ago.
