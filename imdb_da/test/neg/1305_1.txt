This movie follows in The Riddle's track to an all-star British cast in a downright horrible movie! Poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a throw that I hope was well paid, as this will be a nail in many a career coffin. <br /> <br /> Nigel Plans should have donned his Neil wig again & It was like a particularly long and drawn episode of "Torchwood" but without the camp fake Canadian doctor fell ... it had the same too dramatic music though, forever repeated, in vain attempts to drum a little excitement. <br /> <br /> Oh mankind!
