This movie is so bad, and Hellraiser parts 1 to 3 are so big. Nothing is good Bloodline ... a lot of fun but without meaning and most of the time without originality. the film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle. The creator of the Creator and his offspring fight against some demons, but nothing links the 3 stories seriously. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a boring bad guy kidnapping kids and killing birds, and worse ... he's talking too much. One thing that I really didn't understand is why the dog from hell ????? He cannot be a cenobite because he had no human. Why the dog can be killed by pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems ????? Bloodline is incoherent with the film series in many ways. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are old friends in this movie, but it is impossible that Pinhead met Angelique because Pinhead is a World War I soldier and Angelique is an old demon and she lives in Paris since sometimes as 200 years.
