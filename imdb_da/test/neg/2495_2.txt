I've read almost every major book about the Manhattan project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scope was immensely massive - rival in American history, perhaps only by the 1960s space program. There were - literally - MILLION people involved from all walks of life in many places (most secretly) around the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they could not talk about the person sitting in the cabin next to them, much less their family. Logistics is overwhelming, especially considering the considerations of war-time communication, security and transportation in the 1940s. As an example - my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan project. His job was to oversee a crew member of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for producing concrete slant forms for the massive research installations in Hanford, Washington. It was "everything" he did, six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, housing, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials as much as Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! That said, it is simply impossible to do the subject of justice in a 2-hour movie. In defense of Joffe, however, I would say that they had an impossible task, especially when he chose to get a different manuscript with more plotter, more angles and more characters. What did he think, and how could he be so arrogant to believe that it would work? It's Hollywood, I guess. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY have so many mistakes that it would take a book to list them all. Terrible casting. Terrible (and politically motivated) writing. Poor Science The writings of Groves and Oppie are especially inaccurate and righteous lunatics. Despite the manuscript's too obvious agenda, it is still incredibly soft and dull. These errors have been mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly affected by the fact that the researchers had so much time on their hands - softball, riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc. not to mention romance and of course circulating political petitions. According to FM & LB, if these big brains had turned off their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war before D-Day. <br /> <br /> A final grip - - FM & LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the code names of the two atomic bombs, but it does not mention that these names were a half-hearted jab on Groves ( "Fat Man", too heavy stature) and Oppenheimer ("little boy" for his little stature). Another reason, Paul Newman, should not have been in this movie ...
