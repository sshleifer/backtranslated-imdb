That's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island, they are either picked by fishermen or roped in work for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found it in vain by Atlantis, has held staggered researcher Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach in hostages for 15 years so fishermen can uncover a treasure chest under the sea. Cotten is of course a complete maniac. Bach and Cassinelli have good chemistry. This insanity was controlled by Sergio Martino and is not surprising without profit. It is fast, reasonably well-acted, and the fishermen look quite convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone can prove that these things are not like the real fishermen). There is an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.
