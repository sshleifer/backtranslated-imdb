With a cast of mostly less classified stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), miserable special effects (surely, it was the 70s, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade) and a story is so ridiculous that you might cry, it's an "airplane" that should have been justified. <br /> <br /> Even Academy Award winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy cannot hold this "bird" airborne. </ br> <br /> The business of the third movie - the airplane is immersed in The Bermuda Triangle - is much more credible than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "The Concorde" at all costs!
