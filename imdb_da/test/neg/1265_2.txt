I happened upon a rare copy of this early Almodovar movie with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific modern director, I enjoyed his 1988 film "Women of Guardian of a Nervous Collapse" and I had read one or two very positive reviews of movies . Well, I must have totally missed the humor that the reviewers saw in this movie. I just found it disjointed, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are plenty of indoors, tired people and raw sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked the audience in 1982 (which almost certainly was Almodovar's intention), but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years, leaving a blur history. Besides that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - I didn't find this movie fun. I suppose it's possible that there is a very select audience for a movie like this, but I'm just not part of the audience and not sure I want to be.
