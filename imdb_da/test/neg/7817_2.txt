This is the first time I write a comment on a movie I haven't seen for the credits. The reason for this is simple ... people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from quite a few comedies that are in bad taste, but I figured this to be visible. A regrettable decision based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi-) fun as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. Where these two movies had their charm and laugh, it had none (and I mean no !!). The action is horrible, especially the "boss. Tara Reid was not surprising how dare she call herself an actress? The prerequisite is thin and the plot does not thicken at all. Not a problem if you manage to keep it fun and / or sweet ... but as you probably already guessed, it was not at all cast! The scripture felt that it was not completely finished, and I would not even be confused if the director made some rewrites during recording. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent script seriously. And he's not exactly Lassie :-). Stay away from this tripe even though you like stupid goof-ball comedies at times (as I do). This low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many ... I (almost) never give one, so therefore ... a 2.
