Beginning with the last AVP relaxing, an Alien "chestburster" emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship, and causes the Predator Space ship to collide into today's Gunnison Colorado, where it raises more aliens who begin to cause chaos. The Predator race sends down a uniformly highly experienced and armed predator to "clean up the mess". Our human figures are trapped in the midst of the intergalactic battle. The biggest problem with this movie is pacing. This movie is moving too fast. The opening credits have only just rolled, and already the Predator ship goes into the ground after Alien grows to full height, a hunter and son character is introduced, but before we even learn their names, they are both killed, then we see Predator homeland and leading Predator flies to fight the Alien attack, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not provide the whole movie; National Guard enters the city, but within two minutes everyone is killed without even having a good look at a single face, the leader of a pizza shop gets a scene of character development only to be beaten the next time we see him Once again without learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and cook are killed again without learning their names. For a moment, our protagonists are at home, the next is running around the city, the next in a gun shop, the next in an APC, and this random set of jumps over and over, never ever let the audience not have time to settle in letting them grab the bedding. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and the time frame. The movie is set in modern Gunnison Colorado. All other Alien and Predator films were shot in enchanting settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. Now comes with the AVP-R, located in a small modern American town with set highlights, including a sports shop, car parks, pizza shops and pantry rooms. I think they are actually trying to make the movie look as boring, boring and uninteresting as possible? It is difficult to perceive these monsters as scary creatures when standing next to a shelf filled with Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside of little girls. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a major problem with this movie. The Aliens series was set in the future, no people had even heard of an Alien before the first movie, and foreigners had not only been on the ground, but if they ever reached the ground, humanity would be destroyed. This film destroys the whole concept of being put in the present, with Average Joe seeing aliens everywhere, and at the end of the movie humanity is not destroyed and not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. It's pissed all over the concept of the other movies. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machinas. The predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that just melts away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and release a nuclear weapon just as comfortable erases all evidence of alien existence despite the fact that there were many survivors of the incident that are witnesses, and many more bad attempts have been made to fill it impossible to cover plot holes. <br /> <br /> Also for a "Verses" movie, it has unsustainable disturbance in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film, a lone Predator manages to kill dozens, if not tens of thousands of foreigners, all in the mêlée range, while they hardly get a single bottom, while foreigners just slaughter left just and centered as clay pigeons, just waiting their turn to be killed by the Predator without any effort to defend themselves. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", as much as it should be "Predator Massacre Aliens". I mean, how can you have two species beat it with excitement and excitement when you are portrayed as being far better than the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are among the biggest mistakes. Not only are they pale to the characters of the former Alien and Predator films, but even as a self-contained film, they are dull, boring and sometimes worthy of worth. The characters in this movie are that I do not like you, cousins ​​who want to be laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, kids and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off Ripley and Newt; the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all the above signs appear by teenagers. While teens molding is an obvious attempt to enter into the younger audience, only the effect is to make the movie feel like a typical teenybopper slasher porn movie where young actors have learned to give a convincing performance where the most have completely shiny facial expressions that deliver monotonous dialogue. Not only this, but these figures make some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as. Using Predator weapons, comments on the powers when it has been for hours, after stupid plans to get out of town instead of just going out of town a little quick and just as many other idiocs that the movie actually had the audience in my theater that sighed with frustration. In the end, this movie is just a horrible B-movie, something deserved directly to DVD category. The fact that this movie was a theatrical release amazes me, as all parts of the movie are just rows of amateur work.
