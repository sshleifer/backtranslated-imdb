Last week I saw a Royal Shakespeare Company production by Macbeth. It was 25 years old, filmed w / no props except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. The action was super - all the actors trained Britons. Contrasting this performance to this ... yawning given gifts. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy and could not completely lose the New Yorker accent despite the long .... breaks .... between ..... lines .... The whole thing was soporific, even the "comic" scenes were hardly even worth a smile, let a wage laugh a stomach. This should be fun. They tried to make it tragic. Nor was it boring. I give it four points for costumes, scenery and Jeremy Irons, who is good at playing a boring, depressed, in-depth guy (can he be anything else ???)
