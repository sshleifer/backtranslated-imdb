Three young cinema employees have the task of re-opening a long-closed old-time theater, where many years before a shocking series of pigs murder took place. It seems that many more murders have taken place since then, but all this is still unknown to these three young upstart employees who are hoping to finally make it big alone. As they approach the great reopened night, things are becoming alien and more disturbing with things that suddenly begin to move around without having seen help and a scary old man apparently haunting the premises. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is really terrible. In fact, if it were not for Mary Woronov's secretary character to be such a fiercely independent pronounced, empowered young woman who steals virtually every scene where she looks and the incredibly hot chick that played the incredibly blunt but wholly sexy Selina It would be a total loss. The only other good thing I have to say about this movie is some of the movie theater killings performed in truly inventive, albeit not too gory (a preference for me but not necessarily for others) fashion. The rest are just cradles in constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few can actually find humor in it) and run through the predictable slasher killing annoying characters from one after another routine.
