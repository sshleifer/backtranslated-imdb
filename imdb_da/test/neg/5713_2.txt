What happens to this movie? Seems Mr. Lyne and his authors that a sado-masochistic fling between two screwed Yuppies can carry a film of its own length? Maybe if it had some comical elements (which are not, at least intentionally) or there were some extra dramatic elements (which are not), or maybe if it was hardcore. No, it's simply history; a chronology of a bunch of R-rated trysts. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine Â½ weeks" deserves every Razzie nomination it received. It's a loser. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happens to Roger Ebert and his rave review? Where was the head back in 1986?
