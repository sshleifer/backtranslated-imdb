This movie is much like any other modern horror movie. It is predictable in the way it is built and evolved and never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking on the screen. It is really the biggest disappointment in the movie, which overall still had a promising concept for a movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great, walking modern horror movie clich√©. It has all the elements of what makes modern horror movies often not very good looking. One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little child. Why do they continue to put this kind of thing into movies? The same goes for the kind of drama aspects that involve the family. It just doesn't work for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. It often causes the movie to pull in parts and become an annoying look. <br /> <br /> So it has all the cliches present, but it also fails to bring any of these cliches to the screen. As a horror movie, this is simply a very bad one. It does not handle its fear or excitement very well. For the fans of the genre, there is very little to enjoy. The film's story is not too well connected and built up in the movie. Too often, the movie sleeps on parts, and it never allows its horror to fully kick. <br /> <br /> The movie is also often too dark (undoubtedly as an attempt to hide its relatively low budget) and it also shows little to do, mainly due to the fact that you simply cannot always See things as well. <br /> <br /> Just by watching this movie, director JS Cardone doesn't have much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to properly handle his current ingredients. He made some attempts in the past, but all his films have failed so far. He just keeps trying unfortunately. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, which was originally attached to directly), this movie could still have been somewhat decent. It's a bad cast movie, with pretty much unknown in it. The biggest name of the movie is Ben Cross, but his role is just too small and somehow not really relevant enough for the film and its history. It didn't even seem like he had a lot of fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just skip it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
