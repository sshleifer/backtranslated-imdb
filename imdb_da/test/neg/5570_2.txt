I only saw this because I saw a few good reviews for this, so I expected at least a half-way cheesy movie. Toybox doesn't even deliver it. There are so many problems with this flick that I don't even know where to start, so I'll list a few major issues (again, spoiler warning. Just read them, it'll save you the trouble of seeing this later). A movie begins with and often mentions the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (A witch that the protagonist claims to be the reincarnation of) and the middle people (or something, an evil man with a big smile who cuts people with hooks and sell their indards in pies). I liked it, it was a sweet concept, all that has to be done with pies is simply pleasant. But then you see the movie, and it's just about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (and what was it about him? Was he psychic? Did he have powers? Why did he continue to see visions that even the so-called 'Witch' did not ') Don't notice ??) and they meet with their crazy family. Not really crazy, they just argue a lot. That's what most of this movie is and argues for, and they barely touch the supposed myth again, except in a few confusing scenes that you can't make heads or tails about. In a scene, Berenice (the main witch-like character) wanders out and makes a kind of ritual by candles. It seemed quite important, but definitely not done after doing it, it just wasted more of my time. <br /> <br /> And who in the hell was that guy with his dog? You see him going towards the house from the start of the movie with the evil red-eye dog, and then he finally comes and gets killed? What the heck?? Was he a midfielder? Was his dog obsessed? Has anyone killed the dog? They didn't really show it. Also, every scene that involved the vicar was completely meaningless and served only too weakly to explain the lame end. It was as if they had all these interesting ideas, and they went everywhere nowhere! The boyfriend, of course, had some kind of powers, but never explains them. Grandma who seemed to have some kind of witchcraft but never used them. The vicar, who ... Okay, it was nothing at all for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? This was a complete waste of time, and the only reason I give it two stars at all is because a) Berenice is a little sweet, and b) The said pies. Save yourself the money by renting this and dear god doesn't even think about buying it unless wasting money is a new dish.
