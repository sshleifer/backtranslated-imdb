not many people outside Poland have had the opportunity to become acquainted with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. He is very popular in Poland for his fantasy short stories (I think none of them have ever been translated into English. Alas!). to make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a travel monster slayer, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he is basically your favorite tolkien-style cool guy. Unfortunately, no one would find out after watching the movie. The 'wiedzmin' film is nothing more than a collection of random scenes that contain wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not eben remotely resembles the plot and dramatic tempo of the original. event the fact that some of the shots in the movie show attractive naked women do not add any quality to it. The movie gets worse and worse with every minute, and doesn't even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's actually good' category. If you really are in fantasdy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.
