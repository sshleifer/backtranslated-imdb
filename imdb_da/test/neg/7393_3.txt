Now they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 am - it looks like the right time to watch it, and then go to bed afterwards ... <br /> <br /> No, it didn't really live up to my expectations . I think the Dogma concept is good because the film comes so closer to what really happens between the characters involved when you cut out all the unnecessary effects and mood-enhancing music. But then again, this concept requires some interesting actions between the characters. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I know the King Lear (Shakespeare version) very well, if I had known the game, I'd probably have been able to predict a great deal of the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a sign on the screen - and we probably see some bad pages. Oh yes, the color of civilization and culture can be very thin, and behind this paint you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you compare it to "Italian for beginners" or "Mifune's last song", you see the same but opposite things: A crisis can certainly make people see their lives more constructively. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished, I thought to myself, "Oh, that's why I haven't seen it before ..." The movie has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman, the actors, etc. is good. But the script might need something more. A plot might not hurt.
