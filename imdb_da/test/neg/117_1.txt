This flick is a waste of time. I expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting. The play of Lady Dame is terrible. He was never much of an actor, but here it is worse. He was definitely better in his previous films. His screenplay for the whole movie was probably no more than a side of stupid nonsense a liners. The whole dialogue in the movie is a disaster, the same as the plot. The title "The Shepherd" makes no sense. Why didn't they just call "border patrol"? The fighting situations could have been better, but they could not afford it, or the choreographer suffers from lack of ideas. This is a low-cost, low-cost action movie theater.
