... a good script or instructor could not correct. <br /> <br /> The original 'Poseidon Adventure' was a story of human courage triumphant against fantastic odds and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take all that God cast upon him. <br /> <br /> Follow-up attempts to recreate the mix, but fails through a formula script and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a major disaster flicker manufacturer and done a good job of steering the action scenes in 'Towering Inferno', but he just can't bring any human depth to his characters. If the signs are not credible, any danger they face will also fall flat. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original of course. So we have Peter Boyle doing Ernest Borgnine's stuff by being hard and uncomfortable (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the red button moderate influence (and is terminally ill for good measure); Slim Pickens makes the comic relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. To make the story more modern, we have a rogue gun dealer ready to test weapon quality plutonium for the highest bidder. A really uncomfortable piece of work that ruthlessly forfeits wounded men (the actors playing his craftsman were probably paid as extras because they didn't seem to have any lines) and have a woman shot in the back - what a cad! Thousands of times the French rescue services made the hole in the Poseidon's hull twice as large as in 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) so he could get him out. And while we're on the subject, how have they got boxes * to * it ... oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money to see this when it was released. Considering the current reputation of the film, it may seem odd, but it actually got quite mixed reviews at the time. Some said it was unwanted, some said it was as exciting as the original. Never mind, no one can be right all the time.
