When I was a younger (oh about 2) I saw Barney for the first time and liked it. BUT then I didn't have a brain either. And now I look back and see what a terrible show "Barney" really is: First of all, EVERYTHING in that show is scary. Barney, the protagonist, is a horrible 9-foot tall, talking, purple dinosaur who teaches 13-year-olds about "fantasy ...." (* shudders *) BJ (I know what you think of his name.) Is a minor yet creepier yellow dinosaur put in to be "supposudly" cool. But in reality he is the opposite. After watching a few episodes of B.J. dumbly trudging in with his little let down hood, and making some not so funny jokes, I would scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomit *) oh-oh-oh-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character ever. She is a green triceratops (it is a dinosaur) that carries a yellow carpet. Her remarks about "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's "super deeee-doooper" roses make it difficult to sit through each episode as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners. <br /> <br /> And that, my friend, is what makes this show really terrible.
