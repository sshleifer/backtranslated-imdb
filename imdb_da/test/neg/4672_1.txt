I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" flicks with poor dialogue and wood plays. So I turned my brain on to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this block. I can not. You would be hard pressed to put together a larger piece of cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use this term loosely) of a team of "Super-Drillers" flies to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares? It's an action girl. I do not burst the premise. <br /> <br /> Smaller spoilers: <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a few scenes designed to introduce threat and characters. Bruce Willis is the team's hard-as-nail leader and uses his first bit of screen time chasing Ben Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgettable act of sleeping with his daughter. For some reason it didn't make me laugh. It was forced, just like everything in this movie. The team is called because they are the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid. Okay, I'm ready to accept this premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat in the movie. More attempts at humor, with each character going to do some crazy, nutty things before the growth. Again, lame finally they leave. Here's where the movie really struck me. They arrive at the cliff and sit down to work. Do you want to believe it, nothing works right and everything has an exciting countdown !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, surprise surprise, we saved the day again !! <br /> <br /> And don't even get me started on the jerked camera work. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I should be sick. I can only assume they were trying to cover the gigantic holes left by the harmless performances by cutting off to another shot every few seconds (and this from someone raised on MTV - his short attention spans himself). <br /> <br /> Just as I thought it couldn't get any worse ... wait - there's a crafted tearjerker ending that was so dressed it did the rest of the movie a virtual Citizen Kane. Summary: Witticisms were not witty. The reason - well, I said I would let it go. The action was poor. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse. Camera work - again, bad. (I haven't even mentioned the stupid love scene in the motion pictures - thinkers). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times I could look at the lovely life Tyler and try to ignore her acting, this is by far the worst movie I've seen in the theater ... ever
