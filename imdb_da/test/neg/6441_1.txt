Eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to completely abysmal now. It's such a bad reflection of the nation that this crap tops the ratings. <br /> <br /> The ideas of plots can consist of nothing more trivial than ever putting a hat in a hat. The first two out (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the 3rd and 4th out have a match in Vic, the 5th is arrested, the 6th develops an addiction, 7. becomes pregnant, etc. Etc. <Br /> <br /> Manufacturers are wise though. The 30 minute show is only actually ever made up of 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will go to Vic and say, "What's going on?" 2) Someone else will stand up, say "let it be aht" (out) 3) Then a woman will say "Doan choo comes in 'n" abusive mah fam'ly "<br /> <br /> It's That is every show, except occasionally "Get the Black ID / Is it Black ID?" <br /> <br /> Once, the show was a realistic depiction of East End folk music and their lifestyle. 1) They extended it from two nights a week & 2) Slater family settled in. How they attract viewers is beyond me Cat character symbolizes everything that has gone wrong with society, treats others as something she's pulled out of the bottom of her shoes The people who vote her the best character in these polls should be the same as those who vote Jamie Redknapp 'Best Sportsman' despite not having played a game for 3 years. understand is if the show is the highlight of British TV why do all the biggest names leave? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. For a long time, the eldest couple's marriage has lasted where they are faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the screenwriters realize that characters, couples can be interesting and sympathetic without sleeping around in the show, will continue to deteriorate. An episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that. And Zoe & Doctor at the top even Lofty & 'Shell' as 'most compelling couple ever to appear on television.' <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, it is undisputed. But many external factors contribute to it. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time of day to get the most audience numbers, it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of viewers see it out of nothing more than habit, but if they were quite honest with themselves, they would admit that it (in 2002 more than ever) can be absolutely pitiful.
