First of all, let me say that I in no way deny the meaning of the subject - on the contrary. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite some time (actually two of my family members died there) so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I think the main problem lies in the script, which includes too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined but lack the overall meaning. In my opinion, the throw has not really a chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who shows Jerzy - the only interesting character. I want the story to be more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film lacks emotions. Before I saw it, I thought I would be moved if it was only sentimental reasons - but I actually saw seeing it with a strange sense of freedom all the way, except for the final performance scene. It's done well and its location is interesting and gives a climatic end, though the idea of ​​the Lord's prayer being recited jointly by the executed officials seems a little removed. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I assume the film may have some educational value for those who are unfamiliar with the imagined historical events, but in my opinion it does not fail as a cinema work.
