Everyone I talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so I figured I'd rent it. Halfway through the film I thought of myself what was going on and what is the meaning of this movie. This movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didn't even bother me. I mean, what do they have to do with the next volcano 2 The return of lava. I think this movie is so stupid, the characters are so poorly developed, and Eva Englund makes the film worse. I think he might as well be transformed into Freddy Kruegur and the Spook people. I was actually rooting for the bad guy to win how bad it was. I think the father is a policeman, he didn't seem to worry very much about his daughter going through one of the most moments in her life. I think if my daughter was treated like this, I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind the prison. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyder's character would be bad again. This is one of the worst movies all the time with Volcano and 8mm. Don't waist your time, you won't enjoy it ....! <br /> <br /> Grade If there was no character on this site, I would choose it, it's so bad that this movie is!
