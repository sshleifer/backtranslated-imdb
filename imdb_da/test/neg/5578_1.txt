Predator Island starts as six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) & Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend sometime at Kevin's father's boat partying in the open sea. What could go wrong with such a super-sounding idea? For once, a large green meteorite could collide in the ocean near your boat and a foreign life force could come out of it and try to kill you all, so it's just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it? <Br /> <br /> Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was crap & it's a simple and straight forward like it really. The scripture is of the worst kind, you know the kind of abomination that is full of very annoying teenage character who does and says the most stupid things it is full of clich√©s and is completely predictable, it almost does nothing, things just suddenly happens without buildup or explanation, it is boring even in just 70 odd minutes and it has almost no entertainment value at all, not even unintentional laugh value. The film does not have much of what I would call a plot, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that a moment the human being will be 'normal' the next, When history demands it and without apparent cause, they suddenly have green glowing eyes and a sudden urge to turn cannibals. There is not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are pitiful, and I really won't waste another time thinking of Predator Island let alone wasting my precious energy writing these words ... <br /> <br /> Director Castle do nothing to make this thing clear and the 'special effects' are horrible, this strange creator would not even get into a 50-year-old sci-fi movie. The movie authorities even play some blooper footage over the final credit, but it must be the least fun collection of errors ever, I think they can't even get it wrong if you know what I mean! Forget a decent gore, as there is nothing a bit cannibalism and some guts placed on the unfortunate actors stomach, so another unlucky actor can pick them up and enjoy eating them. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 150,000 I have to admit that the filmmakers worked on a seriously low budget, it's still no excuse to make such a bad movie. It all looks very cheap and the play is pretty bad. Predator Island is shit, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is, and I just fail to see what someone would get out of it. In my humble opinion, this is probably one to avoid.
