The play is the worst part of this movie as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a variety of stories possible. (This movie is confusing because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low-value values, and the play wasn't good, but it's telly, so it was fine. I don't mind if some scenes looked like they had finished in a roof. But having such a non-sensual script is completely unnecessary. Did any executive reader actually read it before they calcined the cash? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue was especially badly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been omitted. The prologue was hurried, it was not clear what happened, ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to "There are some missions in Petersburg", where the next scene is that soldiers arrest them. I know the fundamental story of the revolution so that I could fill in the details, "the annoying communists". The poll is best ignored. <br /> <br /> This could have been a thought-provoking study of someone who is confused about who she is. It establishes this premise in asylum. It may then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the movie. No. Gone. The film assumes that she is, as she says, that she is (although there is still no empirical evidence). It creates a melodramatic romance, a love so strong it will believe in everything she says. Okay, a sweet romance. No, because it doesn't make sense. The love interest seems like a scary (and incidentally sleazy) lunatic, jumping into wild movements. This also does not work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite the fact that there were lots of love scenes, I was never convinced of the reason they were in love. I find rom-com romances more convincing, even though there are only one or two scenes that state that they have even spent some time with each other. <br /> <br /> It could have been a thriller-type thing where movies presume she is, as she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the trial is summed up rather than treated. The bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better movie. The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life she had struggled with lunatic behavior. None of this in the movie either. There is a very annoying character in the asylum that breeds from nowhere and announces itself as a 'A Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next /' Twelve Monkeys' type informant. Fortunately, she disappears and has not brought anything to the story.
