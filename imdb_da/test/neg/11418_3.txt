My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. She will apparently see something with a vampire council in it. I was bored all the way through. At various points, Underworld reminds: Rise Of The Lycans at Spartacus, Fight for the Apes, the Passion of Christ and Mandingo! What it reminds me of most is the Italian swords and sandal pictures of the 1960s (not the good ones) that spend a tremendous amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes and talking incessantly while waiting impatiently for the muscular hero and his lover, usually the despot daughter, to do something. <br /> <br /> This movie was in desperate need of little color and excitement. The characters were rather two-dimensional. The sets looked as if they were built entirely of tin! I wonder how many civil war sets were melted down to make this movie. All those who wear fishing socks on your arms and black lipstick are welcome to click NO.
