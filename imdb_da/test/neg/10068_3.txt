Although there are three Star Wars, Krull and countless others coming, this movie will look obsolete in the 1950s ... 1 SFX is mostly annoying after a short while of 1970s video game effects like bolts, etc. You also get an SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier-IV Harryhausen monster. Two sets are mostly ruins in the countryside, with Papier-Mache temples and miniature towns or stalls making the 1950s Japanese monster films resemble perfect perfection. 3 Plot is extra thin paper ... Hercules must find Zeus' seven golden thunderbolts stolen by collecting gods and zombie tyrants. <br /> <br /> 4 action consists mainly of retarded, muscled-up Hercules (see different facial expressions) breaking of cheap 1970-player video games. <br /> <br /> 5 counting prize goes to Milly Carlucci (third Carlucci show-biz sister with Anna & Gabriella) who says everyone. <br /> <br /> 6 SFX makes other tier II Italian salad bowl films like L'UMANOIDE & STAR CRASH look like masterpieces. that Ferrigno's main exploitation consisted of forming a delayed green monster, wearing a whig and green espadrillas, we should be light. <br /> <br /> See it and forget it.
