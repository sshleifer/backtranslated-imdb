This show was premature and proud of surprising cuts in advertising (when it came back from commercial, noise or "surprise" was something simple as a mouse) This is a pure rip-off of Ghost Hunters and it is trying to "pass" them and fail miserably. Also what is with the director's log-stuff? Is this star map? It just destroys the news of this show, which quickly ran out. The only reason it has been seen is that people will laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature. They never find anything and probably will never. Funnily enough, they always point to something that is the thing they are "hunting" and guessing what? It is the local radio station tower that flashes red!
