As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the "Millennium" series) and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I had expected at least some of this movie. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the play is bad, and the computer graphics used for most stunts do not work. Sometimes it appears that they have taken some pictures from Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> The cinematography also sucks. Unnecessarily funky camera work at the beginning only diminishes (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-to-video look. It works in hip hop movies and Jet Li movies, but looks out of place in this flick. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 then.
