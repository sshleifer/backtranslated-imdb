If you can get past the slow start and bad play it is worth seeing. The story was pretty decent. The father had a bad mood because he was unemployed and he could hardly see his child except in the summer because his former wife had custody of him. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story was not too scary. The movie breaks the consistency of the monster so incredibly strong. The one scene that the filmmakers do this is one of the times when the child is down in the basement and the monster goes to attack him. When the monster attacks the child his arm is trapped in a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about a foot away from the child's face. Every second time in the movie, the monster is strong enough to break through or tear down anything. But the steel trap and the chain keep him from getting the baby! More than likely, moviemakers did this for the shock factor because no one wants to see one of the protagonists die. Moviemakers would just scare us into believing it could be an opportunity for the child to die. Instead of breaking the context, the filmmakers should have replaced the child with a person whom they could dispose of!
