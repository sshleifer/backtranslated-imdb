Overall, it was a tough movie. I haven't stopped it or stopped it to get back to it - a clear sign of a dull movie - so it passed the first test. Best of all, it quickly came into history, no boring unnecessary back story for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never be a good movie. Not like a big B movie. I would recommend this movie to slasher / horror fans who don't mind direct releases. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some films of it's ilk, there is no nudity, only moderate language and rather bad acting. However, there is violence. The deaths were rather dry and imaginative. The computer's special effects were actually pretty good. The way the 'creature' exploited its chains in some scenes reminded me of the 'Crack' and 'Ghost Rider' comics. <br /> <br /> A little pet sign ... It's located in Lousinia, but no one seems to talk to any accent. I had to see the credits for realizing it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-cost films, there are small goofs in the movie. Lack of time and money would be the most important factors for goofs. For example, in a scene it went from mid-afternoon to give black in seconds ... during a short drive. The second occurrence was the stunt double the 'creature' did not have on the 'creature' makeup when it fell out of the drawn truck ... it also looks like he has a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br /> In summary, I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it either. I'll probably never rent it again, but if a friend owned it, I can see it again in a few years.
