Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs, and the women will be equal for the abuse they have suffered. The only difference is that in this movie everyone is a pig or has a bunch of brains. I hated this movie for the moral question of why it is right to send a man to prison for the life of a murder he did not commit. Is it a more immoral act than his abuse and annihilation. This film shows all the situational ethics for poor writing. I saw it on CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If this is Britain's best, no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this movie was David Tennant, he plays his character as so despicable that I tend to spit on the next person speaking with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to live the victim, but eventually comes as immensely rude as David Tennant's character. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In brains for brains category are parents who see something wrong with overtly psychotic Brendan. English police officers are made to be so incompetent that they are unfit to make traffic tickets. The British policeman's Union should sue the film's decision-makers for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the power it takes to run your DVD to watch it.
