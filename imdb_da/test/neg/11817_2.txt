This is a heck of a sleazy movie. Like so many "women in chains" films, this is a bit full of lesbianism. But, unlike most previous films that heavily involved this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a horrible mass of skin as a horny female prison guard who reads the women while they shower and have sex with one of the inmates. In the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft core pornographic movie - like GIRLS GONE WILD GOES TO PRISON! It is also a bad rip-off of DEFIANT ONES, but in this case, two hot females hate each other that are linked together as they escape. While the original film is considered a classic, it can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is no subtlety, and the film is just cheap - cheap excitement, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black prisoner with an attitude" - a lady who was set up and sent to jail on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, they cannot both stand each other and have opposite goals. But as it is the clich√© drive, there really is no surprise in how the movie ends - with their both being (gag me) friends.
