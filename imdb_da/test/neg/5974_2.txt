I'm sorry to say it, but it's actually one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. Due to the name "Darwin's Nightmare", I expected a documentary on issues related to the Nile perch in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to either fish or lake. And to a large extent you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes lacking a meaningful connection ... Why does this movie waste time on: - Does not show us relevant information about the Russian pilot's families (several minutes wasted on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - Worry for the death of an African child bitten by a crocodile (as if it could not have happened without the Nile perch) - Shows us about 100 times how planes landing and starting at the airport - Showing us strange religious events for several minutes - Discussing in detail a life and death of a horn at the airport - Talking to children about their mothers, fathers - what they work and / or how they died (well guess what: some died of HIV - who would have guessed it?) Just a few examples I could move on to more pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is totally unfocused and doesn't know what it will tell you point of view. If you have never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has Social / Health / HIV / Violence / War problems, this movie may be right for you. If you haven't closed your eyes for the last few decades, 90% of what this movie shows will not be new to you - and the way it is presented here will do its best to get you to sleep. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my expectations for this movie were too high, but I really didn't like it, though this is a topic I would find interesting in general. If this movie will show how poverty is related to the Nile perch than it might have spent some time discussing that issue ...
