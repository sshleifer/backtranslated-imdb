This must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The management, the play and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot in a meaningless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the movie it was easy to find out the whole plot, and then there are more obvious traces very early to leave some mystery. I guessed this within the first few minutes and I was hoping that I was wrong and much to my dismay I was not. The movie starts with two FBI agents who drive to a remote city to investigate a murderous spree that has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a policeman. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account during the day. Each has something to hide about himself and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the gracious grace and if developed could have made this movie better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends with the FBI agents being the actual killers, and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and then left the unhurt of them. Why do they go through the whole charade to interview three witnesses and tie up with the young girl if their idea was to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents (when you discover that real FBI agents had been killed and their brands were found on them)? How did they know how to create and use the surveillance cameras? Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so compelling from the beginning to the end. Perhaps the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not outrageous at least. The young girl's character is also wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no importance to whom she prefers to bind together in her ordeal. She does not seem alarmed, but rather detached, which in turn is not explained. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie on the whole.
