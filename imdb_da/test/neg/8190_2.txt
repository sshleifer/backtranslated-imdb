I haven't seen many movies worse than this one. The story, the dialogues, the play: it's horror! The story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. Every time you think you missed something, but no, it was the way it was supposed to be. And why on earth is the character that Jenny Garth depicts so in love with that no one loses guy (who actually plays in the movie Cinderella Man with Russel Crow!)? Okay, it's no Spielberg, of course ... I have to write ten lines to be sent. This movie is really not inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic feel good movie with a miserable story, so if you're up for it: you have a ball.
