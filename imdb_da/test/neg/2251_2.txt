I'm sorry people, but I have to say that I really can't understand the overwhelming emotions that everyone gets by watching this movie ... When I saw it, I looked at my watch to know how much more time I had to spend with this nursery nursing. <br /> <br /> So why this judgment? <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie tells a story that doesn't give any excitement! It's not even the entertaining distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every little child's head. It has nothing intelligent in it, nor is it inventive and it goes on for hours ... the story has appropriate content for approx. 30 min. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that should leave a somewhat cold picture. Does not work. Even the previously seen cuts that Tarantino often uses, confuse and in no way cool. <br /> <br /> Other: Some boys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Oh really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of whom was man enough to die rather than betray their companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier who is more brave than any of the "Basterds"? Certainly not -> fail and what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Now they are all killed by Nazis, except two who are being held hostage -> wow, what terrible revenge monsters they are ... Third: What characters? Yes and! The only role and only hope for the whole movie is Chritoph Waltz, who builds a really deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is totally out of action by Waltz. Never seen such a faint performance of Pitt ... And the rest? Well, some Germans you have never seen before and will never look for. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds, I hoped to see something like "Magnificent Seven": A group of extraordinary guys, each with a distinct character who made their way to their destiny fearless and knowledgeable ... I was so much disappointed when I saw "indlourious Basterds". No details at all, no signs, no real men, just some random guys, you can't remember who didn't get a chance to distinguish between them ... But in fact you don't even have to differentiate because "Inglourious Basterds" except that Pitt hardly plays any role in this movie ... So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie in place # 40 of the best movies all the time is the only thing about this leaving me with my mouth opened .. .
