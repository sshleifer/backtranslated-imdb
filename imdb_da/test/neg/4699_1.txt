This movie had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it revealed incompetence at almost every level. The presence of Roger Moore on the cast list is usually a sign that the film is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because Moore always has the lead and he can't act. But this movie also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin in it and was based on a Wilbur Smith book so I thought I'd give it a try as I watched the DVD for sale in Copenhagen ... <br /> < br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene seemed to begin in the middle of a reel, with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been shortened. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew. This bad edit was a sign of things to come, but the dreadnought scene was interesting enough to keep me going. The special effects were good, and the crew had the correct uniforms and spoke in German, suggesting that the director has at least taken into account historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I watched and then Moore showed up and my supplements were confirmed. Bad plays, cliché lines, cliché cinematography and inexpensive humor ... but worst of all, there is a catastrophic attempt to blend the movie's bright feeling with serious drama and tragedy. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The movie ends so suddenly and as badly as it started ?? in the middle of a coil.
