Terror in the jungle is a real find. If you saw that, you're one of the few lucky ones. It is fun! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of the South American jungle. The crash scene must be seen as believed. Everyone dies in the crash, or they are subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blonde boy survives. A nearby tribe brings the child to their village, and they (all men) honor him because of his golden hair! I'm not asking you! In the end, there is a lot of wrestling between natives and the man on the quest for survivors in the abandoned airplane. Still, the child sits on a throne and his blonde hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries nonstop !! It's a hoot !!! <br /> <br /> Very unclear and contains very dubious subtitles. A must, if you are obscure, it's so bad - it's good movie.
