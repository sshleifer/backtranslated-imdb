Ughh this movie is horrible. The script is silly and of course chase doesn't tell Zoey, he doesn't love her !!! Like every episode ... ill never understand zoey 101 (the show) Also why the heck does Logan's father act then resume. And it's just about zoey and chasing what with the other characters. It's always the same in every episode, Quinn does and invention, something goes wrong wrong with the invention, and Zoey's brother always gets involved in it. If you haven't seen it, don't waste an hour watching this cuz you'll waste your time !! SMaybe this may be interesting for an eight-year-old well 8-10, but I can't imagine any elderly watching this rave movie. But what can you expect from nick ???
