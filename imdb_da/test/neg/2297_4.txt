The glorious Edward will move up into the world when his supervisor tells him that he can release these lame Swedish drama films and walk up the stairs to the splatter and gore department. Tied together with his great expectations for the new type of movie, he will soon edit, he asks all sorts of questions about the pay, his work area and the lunch brake. Well, not really. Edward may be quite the opposite. Quiet, stuttering guy, he also got glasses. With the exception when he is insane. I think it created a much fresher atmosphere. Evil Ed is with all reason a Swedish film, but somehow a magical force came over the good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I think it's some of the expertise an actor needs these days. The action is very much. Wood, which in them is inflexible, not pliable (well hello, what did you actually expect?). In addition, the movie has a jamming techno theme song, sounds like its E-Type. In any case, this only makes the movie experience worse. Since I'm pretty hard against this movie so far, there will usually be a breakpoint where I show the level of happiness. But there really isn't much to say. The drawings look good, but somehow "Hanz" spelled coffee over it and partially destroyed it. This is how I look at this movie. If the movie ended where Edward was taken to a mental institute and they renewed the parts from which he went crazy and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that is just my radical perception. I would also like to see more recordings from losing limbs movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this movie. Let's say the actors really are American, live in America, why should they work on a Swedish movie that Edward did? And also the delivery man, why is he never using the doorbell, which is right next to him? Instead, he goes away with flashing at the door. Good old Edward really has some good ears to hear all that while editing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie had its moments, it's just a shame there weren't that many. But that doesn't mean I won't recommend it. It's a pretty cheap movie, go ahead and buy. It's almost like I see a pattern for the prize and the movie. On the other hand; If you like watching dubbed movies get crappier at another it may be IT. My judgment would then be a rock solid 4.
