I agree with a commentator who says it's really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. Doing so, the film, on its merits, should be considered rather terrible in view of the hilarious, coincidental dialogue, it is generally mediocre to the poor, acting by the casting as well as the zero production values. However, such an assessment does not take the exact experience of watching this movie as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It is not even the requirement of tolerance to people embracing alternative life choices that fascinate except as a historical relic. <br /> <br /> What does Glen or Glenda do? Still, a fascinating movie after 50 years is that Ed Wood put his psyche in a way that so-called auteur directors like Hitchcock or Godard despite their very superior talents never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his own strongly contradictory feelings about being a transvestite despite the requirement of tolerance for it through the film. In fact, the end of the film concludes that Ed Woods Glen character could "kill" his Glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife Barbara. The psychiatrist even calms Glen and Barbara that, as Glen does the mental transfer, Glenda will disappear. So even though Wood could rely on transvestite tolerance in general, he wasn't so sure to want it for himself. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Wood was not afraid to throw anything else that crossed his mind on display. He did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. If it wasn't together, then what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda, in particular, was Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its basic rigor. The only comment I would add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria mentioned in the first paragraph. The strange memorial effect that the film has despite the technically terrible qualities I do not believe can be judged.
