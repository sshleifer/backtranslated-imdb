Why would anyone make a movie like this? Why would anyone invest in a movie like this? Why would anyone in the film industry work on a movie like this? Why would any theater show a movie like this? Why would any TV channel program a movie like this? Why would any critic bother to review a movie like this? Why would anyone see a movie like this? Why should there not be mental examinations of the authors / producers / instructors of a movie like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad that they are good. This is a movie that is so terrible that it's terrible. IMDb must really introduce a "0" or even a minus scale to embrace works of this horrible pretentious horror.
