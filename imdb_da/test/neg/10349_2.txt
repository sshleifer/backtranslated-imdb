I've tried to see it twice, though I haven't been able to review any of the episodes. For me, it's pretty much just not fun. I can tell where I suppose to laugh, but I can't. I have never seen the original, so I do not compare. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies as married ... with kids and family guy, but this show just doesn't do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the play is mostly annoying. The ads made it interesting, but it is not. They try too hard to be different and bind to force humor. That style doesn't usually work well. I don't think this show ends the season. Of course I could be wrong.
