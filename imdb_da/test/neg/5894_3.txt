We never know the truth about 9/11. And this shoddy movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently watched a YouTube report claiming that there were no aircraft involved in the Twin Towers destruction; that all the news programs were apparently provided with the same angle traces from the towers of a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and in the recordings provided, CGI aircraft were replaced by real MISSILES, which actually hit the towers. <br /> <br /> It's a convincing video, and even though I'm not a Wacko Conspiracy Theorist in itself, I'm still not sure if actual airplanes hit anything that day (Towers, Shanksville Field, Pentagon - because there is no aircraft wreck available. (And what about the infamous "black boxes"? No one recovered.) One million other theories abound, all of them directing a truth drop into a speculative ocean. But you will drown in malarkey before you find something truthful or worth speculating in the 9/11 COMMISSION'S REPORT, a non-budget film that tries to close the door after all horses and jihadists have escaped. <br /> <br /> Of course, writer director Leigh Scott is a concerned US citizen who wanted to inform the public about what the 560-page report could reveal. It would help if his movie had actors, instead of a guy resembling David Duchovny, a chick that looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe, and another guy I'm absolutely sure of on, trying hard to be Sean Bean. It would help if his camera operator had no Parkinson's; if the light director did not try to save on electricity it would help if his editor had no disturbance of attention, or if the soundtrack was not a trivial new world order esotericism; and the looping should have been deployed when people actually moved their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can't even call this propaganda. It's too much fun. And with fun, I mean inflexible. <br /> <br /> You can't squeeze a problem into this complex in a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all the sexy catches we've grown into: bin Laden's intention to attack, buy weapons from Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi participates in air school, weapons of mass destruction ... The problem is: We know that it is all retrospective, so every discussion has the affected intelligence operators with each other a series of false checks all pointed to a narrow conversation. Conversely, reverse engineering is all relevant, succinct, so we can shake our heads strangely as to how incompetent all these branches of government are turned up. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous interrogation scene with a lubricating bimbo that looks up at a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now - it would be considered torture if most guys did not consider it a turn-on. <br /> <br /> Tagline is: "What if the attack could have been stopped?" On this movie's account - and we assume, according to the Commission's report - that the CIA and other underground agencies all intended to capture bin Laden and not. Anyone involved in the "terrorism" reports (you think you actually read these reports?) Are so worried that we just want to let them go for their bad plays. <br /> <br /> But the whole story goes so much deeper than banal soundbytes the negligent Ku Bush Klan filled the American people after 9/11. We now know that even capturing bin Laden before the attack on the 9/11 would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were moving with or without the Taliban figurehead, whose inclusion was the possible notion of a person's fancied imagination to unite America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief, "they" have not "attacked us." As Ron Paul tried to clarify, it was the case with Middle Eastern blowback - "they" were so sick of America that planted their incredible feet "over there" that they brought the war "over here." So even though George W. Death wants to endure the indecent: "We fight them over so we don't have to fight them in here" in fact "because we're over here, the fight has been over here." <br /> <br /> The 9/11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists as it was gross negligence from the Bush administration, which we know (without probing the Commission) had all the intent of the Clinton administration and forward; information on terror cells that reach critical mass and their intention to cause chaos. But Texas Idiot in Texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather have a vacation at his Crawford Ranch than spend an extra day at work, lifted the duty he swore an oath to perform - protecting the American public. <br /> <And when the scum, who called himself president, used the attacks caused by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down landlords to score another concept, destroying the US constitution and taking America to a false war a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Strangely enough, the film never goes near the Ku Bush Klan and makes no sense or judgment, Leigh Scott will remain neutral. Tell it to the raped and plundered hundreds of thousands in the false war on terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> Out of pure chance, I realized I was watching this DVD while I was bringing my "Bush lied." Thousands died. "T-shirt.
