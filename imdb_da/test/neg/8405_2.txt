I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably orderly, and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but it's about it. But this sequel makes it look like "Gone With The Wind"! <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby, Andrew is now an adult, and the cow wants him to take over (the world there). But there are forces trying to stop it ... and Andrew doubts himself ... I give this a 2 for a few reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew, and there is an eerie moment in the beginning with Rosemary (Patty Duke) "kidnapped" by a bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Other than it is boring, silly and superfluous. The original did not need a successor! Ira Levin's book follow-up in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Initially set Duke ... and tune out. Not worth doing.
