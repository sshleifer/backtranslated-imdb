I saw the first few episodes a short while ago and felt that I couldn't take it anymore. The terrible giant scenes are the worst I have ever had in my life. Ca. One-third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "mighty" combat movements. I know that choreography from that era is not as high as in today's standards, but it is ridiculous. They don't even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, who almost doesn't look like a fighter, uses his drunk slow moves and child fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, weapons and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene where he does a similar action in the water. Basically, each episode has scenes similar to that. As for the rest of the episode, there is not much else I remember. I looked pretty much out of curiosity about what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
