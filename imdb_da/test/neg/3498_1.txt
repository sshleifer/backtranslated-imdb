This movie was offensive PC, predictable and clich√©. I couldn't imagine a movie better illustrating the myopic, narcissistic sermon of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen this, don't bother to see it. If you have, show something to and tell people how terrible it really is. My wife, a minority in itself, was offended by the film's inherent and infinite racist message. This movie has nothing to do with the real world, and has suffered, if anything, from adding to any discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it is the kind of cheap, sensational bush that is promoted as deep and challenging thought. What kind of bubble do you have to live in to believe that it is impressive at all?
