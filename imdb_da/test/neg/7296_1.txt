I watched this movie with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-boyfriend on a small Mediterranean island. <br /> <br /> When the tape was started, I and my boyfriend were tied to a wooden pole in the far end of this cave as area. I told her to close my eyes and whatever happened to not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and began to scream after a few seconds. Nazi faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. After a few seconds, the video tape jumped out of the VCR and landed back in that box and the top snapped shut. Me and my girlfriend were left. <br /> <br /> As a result of this experience, the video cassette was put in a wooden box and stored in a large warehouse of identical wooden boxes that were never to be seen again.
