I admit - I was lured to this from the hype - and I didn't stop considering the sources. "One of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)", shocking "and" a must have ". <br /> <br /> Well - I wasted my money, but not everything was bad in this movie. At least get done right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen for a long time. There is even a story (kinda) and it's about it. <br /> <br /> But for an exploitation movie there is a surprising amount of content - but no use We get homosexual sorta We have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe We have a psychotic Vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok, it made me wiggle) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I don't get that part) We have an honesty for goodness Capone - bet among the best of the actors in this movie - it's not a compliment, and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in - I don't know - try to connect vengeance / random / temporal quarrel of Jimmy Boy to make the Vietnamese psycho seem sane ??????? Second, this film shows that the Italians and t he Americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. The Latin can make shit and the rest of them. Kudos goes to everyone involved in this achievement who overcame it and made a career for himself.
