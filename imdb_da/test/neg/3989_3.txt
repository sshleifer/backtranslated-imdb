The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the illuminated stove, through the open street and the worn-out garage to the blaze that is the climax of the movie. It also has a fantastic sense of time, both the 1950s (the film's opening) and the 1960s. All the performances are top notch, especially Mathew MacFadyen as the psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as father who finds his own intolerance terribly magnified by his son. What a shame when the story is so ridiculous. To start concentrating on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, it completely fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on society. In the church we see five or six of the main characters on the front and another two or three on the back, but the rest of the congregation may as well be mannequins: they show no sign of hearing him, heeding him or dissenting from him; on the cockfight no one says yes or no when he interferes with the case, but no one applauds or condemns when Caroline throws a pint over him; A situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved at the beginning of work pain. Secondly, Middletown (which is actually not a city but a small village) seems to lack some important services, such as. Police and Fire Department: Murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a ball bar; residents see an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole city as if they were in the cinema. For that matter, everyday things like telephones and newspapers are markedly absent, the rural area is strange without livestock or wheat fields, and the most confusing thing to anyone for a 'typical' north of Ireland's surroundings is only one Christian community - not even a few Anglicans season the mixture. Although you are willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is quite worn, a pale imitation of an A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's beautiful in the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated without stopping for 90 minutes, it becomes more than a little annoying. My advice: watch this with the sound off.
