This movie was released in all major theaters in Australia. I watched the movie on the weekend of AUG 7, and I thought it was absolute nonsense (and I use the word extremely wise). How it was released to every major cinema no idea. The reason seemed simple enough that the world was divided into subclasses, and people needed identity cards, and actor Tim Robbins played an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate a staffing ID card that turns out to be actress Samantha Morton. <Br /> <br /> From the summary, you think the rest of the story is intentional, but it doesn't just confuse the audience even more with different non-related stories. <br /> <br /> If you think about watching this movie let me save you the problems DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE.
