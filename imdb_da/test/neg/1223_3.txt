I saw all three segments and am so disappointed with the story. Zahn spends so much time imitating Duvall, he does nothing else in the show. And Tommy Lee Jones would never be as weak as a young man, unlikely yes, but never weak. We never see how or why they go back to Lonesome Dove ... which is a dirt hole in the original ... why should they ever leave Austin where they are heroic ... not to do anything throughout the movie ... I Blue Duck rods at the end of the movie and he was completely miscast. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it just ends. This mini-series could have been "someone" ... tragic. It looked like it was ruled by parrot and hunting
