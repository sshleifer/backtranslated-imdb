Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he should finish touring, and the other boys call him traitor. It didn't happen like that, and as the movie indicates at the beginning, some scenes are overreacted. A movie about The Beach Boys does not have to be that way, because in many cases many things have happened. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. Hard-core fans that I knew this is not the whole true story and therefore I gave it a low rating 3. But it's the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen so far that says a lot about the other movies. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary file Endless Harmony.
