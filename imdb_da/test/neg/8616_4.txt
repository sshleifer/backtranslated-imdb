An in-name only sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires, this film takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and a sect of good vampires who don't. While it is an interesting idea to put a vampire movie in Thailand, the authors do not seem to do much with the exotic site. This movie could just as easily have been put in Los Angeles. Which brings me to my next point, which is that this works much like Blade Lite. We have the rock soundtrack, martial arts scenes, a dance club and a lot of sharp objects going through vampires. What we do not have is the budget and the talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, because his performance was not so good, and there are lots of decent lead work and lots of rugged fighting sequences, maybe too many. The problem is that they just don't have the same influence as those in any of the Blade movies. Maybe it's just that the movie has a "been there," it feels. <br /> <br /> But for me, the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between lead, the game of buff and gentle Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. She is shaken at the beginning of the girl after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. We have no interest in her well-being at this time and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk her neck to save her. Now it's a big drawback when it's the main point of the plot. <br /> <br /> Ultimately you can do worse than wasting 85 minutes of your time with this, but I can think of much better things to do with your time, like renting any of the Blade movies .
