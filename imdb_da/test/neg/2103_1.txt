There are spoilers, but trust me, I'll do you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to watch crappy movies every single time. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our talent for on-site jokes; We set out to find movies that were worth watching, in fact it is not worth seeing. But problems come into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I'm firmly convinced not to give a cent to such a group of talented scumbags. So as another reviewer has said, movies like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea; Instead of just for VIDEO, you're right on the INTERNET. That way, ass bags that made this travesty will never win anything. Which you unfortunately know they do. They employ a lot of actors who can't shop, special effects from a high school, rubber hoses you can get in the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o and the two main characters who seem to switch between being the border jumping Mexicans who only Speaking Spanish, Arabs being 100% fluent English, random nudity, a guy being shot as 10 times, including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in film, book, hollow drawings and hustler magazine . The fact that I actually predicted that the jell-o-puking snake girl would actually transfer to a snake about halfway through fear of me ... In any case, the movie is good at having fun, but you have to make sure that There are at least 4 of you and you spit all the jokes into quick fire because if there is another 1 second to watch this movie where you do not laugh your ass, you will feel physically ill. I'm not asking you. My friends and I ate chicken wings and now I can't even look at anything like this without being reminded of this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of Alien Vs. Hunter, which is by far the second worst movie ever made. And I've seen lots of bad movies. Incidentally, the same production company is like this movie, and the bald guy is also in both. Just thought you liked to know the little fun fact. -100 out of 10.
