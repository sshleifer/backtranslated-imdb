"Maximum Risk" is a step side by side for Van Damme and just several of the uninspired B-movie action stuff we have expected from movies with the macho Belgian martial artist. The flick has gaping plotter holes, loads of goofs, a messy conglomerate plot, and a beautiful Henstridge, who spends most of her time, looks as if she's waiting for a cue. "Maximum risk" does not distinguish in any way and will probably not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audience. (C)
