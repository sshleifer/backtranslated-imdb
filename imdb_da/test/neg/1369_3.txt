I was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and I saw it in Japan. The movie's plot was not my cup of tea as a high school, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. It had been ballyhooed in the press, so even service personnel abroad had heard of it, even though it was never screened at the Post Theater. <br /> <br /> The movie started the tendency to throw objects to the audience, which were taken to absurd levels with later 3-D movies. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you've been warned about it. In many films of the time, actors would often work in front of a "rear projection screen" where backgrounds could be projected to make it seem like they were in another environment, such as A jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage. This works well on regular movies, but when seen in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the players. There were several scenes in the movie where the rear projection was used, and it didn't work well in the theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only meaning of the film is historical, as it was the first of its kind.
