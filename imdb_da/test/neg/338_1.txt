I have 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! The reason is choppy and very predictable. Most of the actors act as extras without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a crew of 'Scotties' from Star Trek without personality or charm. Unnecessary scenes of people who put up counters! Tent with all the probably high-tech equipment! Actors look as though they were not sure the camera was on them. Nothing to worry about whether these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low gear! Nothing seems original or even a little entertaining. Do not waste your time!
