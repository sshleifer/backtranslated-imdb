For several reasons, this movie is simply horrible. Other posters have mentioned some of the film's historical flaws. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant. I usually forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. And shrinking a long story down to a two-hour function requires some, let's say, historical license. But this film goes far beyond pure rounding. <br /> <br /> Worse. To tell a story from a distant time, the movie uses flashbacks that just make the story more confusing. Unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period, they will quickly be lost. In addition, the film was of course recorded simultaneously in Italian and English with various actors being called later. At times, the actors seem to be in completely different movies, which were then edited together. In fact, this is not far wrong. The actors were obviously put on a cheesy computer generated in ancient Rome. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring mess is stars, because I always find Peter O'Toole entertaining. But there is no need to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better movies available.
