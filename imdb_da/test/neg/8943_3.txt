OK, so it's horror? I get horror - but I'm not terrifying. Black and white is artistic, but too much variety is overkill ..... enough about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... a lot of these around. It has been done in the past and yes it will continue to be done ..... but I hope not. My question is, when will the audience tire of reliving this crazy dilemma? I think the director thought he would do something different - depicting the killing of children. Well it has been done before too. So I suppose he had to go to shock value ..... get them killed in the darkest fashion. Okay ..... the crowd was shocked ...... sick .... disgusted ..... numbed. And I got up from my seat and felt all these things. So was the director successful? Yes! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to feel, and I did. What do I do now with the emotions? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the fantastic talent that Francis Xavier was "gifted" with ..... could he ever consider using it to make movies that talk about, dare I say to get out of the dark? I was left in the dark after watching this movie, my soul was assaulted .... is that what this craft is about? There are many such movies out there - they make the bucks I'm told. So what happens to the people who want to see all those enchanting pictures? What happens in this world that people will pay to be terribly shocked? Would I see this again ..... not ever.
