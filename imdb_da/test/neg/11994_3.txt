Glenn Ford, a New York boy who has saved his money, thumbs and hobos way to the Arizona ranch he has bought, hoping to find HEAVEN WITH A BARBED WIRE FENCE. <br /> <br /> A movie featuring a Dalton Trumbo script and story, directed by the villain's extraordinary Ricardo Cortez, and starring in the often-migrating Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte should just not be so bloody beautiful. Although the system - mostly seen as average police and railway forces and real estate agents - is as terrible as one might expect from the leftist Mr. Trumpets, every proletarian is just as sweet and good and salt of the earth, that one feels nauseous. It doesn't help that the heroine - a cute blonde thing that is an illegal refugee flying from Franco's Spain - is annoying because of both scripting and action. <br /> <br /> So why see? Richard Conte has in his first role already his persona and quite a good deal. And there are some moments of the 30s leftist camp that is pretty amazing. (Must Dalton definitely put a big part of the movie into the mission of the Russian worker? All that was missing was a portrait of a brilliant Joe Stalin!) This too is Glenn Ford's first material role (though his performance is not good). <br /> <br /> Why not see? In essence, the film gives a convincing vision, is tied to a political point of view that is risible, and the two leaders have made much better movies. Also, the strength of the Dalton Trumbo as a writer is nowhere in evidence. Instead, we get a movie that Coen Brothers Barton Fink could have written in a flash (and avoided the hell with the author's block).
