I was under the assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo, but it was not, it was something that should not have been made even for its time. They pamper themselves in "blackface" fashion because they fly to Africa and they even work as Stepin Fetchit, and all the others rolled into one. There are some comics that are racist, but they are classics, a mixed woman, I have the right to say this, but if you are in the historical aspect of these comics, try Marrie Melodies "Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss" You won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a website like YouTube. I do not recommend young children to see this, but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant, it is better suggestion, not to mention this particular cartoon has bad animation, I know it was 1932 but I have seen it better for its time. <br /> <br /> "Fly" is unnecessary. -1 out of 10
