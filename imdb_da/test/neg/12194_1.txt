What is the meaning of this movie? It starts out as a movie, so changes the track, cheats us off a resolution to that movie and ends up as another movie that is just a pale and pale imitation of so many other schlock horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a big hubris. Manuscript of Tarantino, direction of Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe in their own hype and assume that what they do must be good just because they did. But it doesn't work quite like that. You are only good while continuing to do good things. There are so many questions to ask: What is George Clooney and Harvey Keitel getting involved in such a meaningless boy? Clooney initially makes an exciting bad guy ?? completely ruthless and effective ?? And it would have been interesting to see where it went. But of course we never do that. And Clooney of the vampire movie changes to a completely different character. It's not smart or witty, it's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill fit all the way through, and no wonder. Has no one in the study looked at the manuscript before this project was given forward? Tarantino is utterly uncomfortable as a murderous sexual offender (and why he as the author assumed that we would find rape, cruel murder and slaughterhouse of an unofficial hostage fun). On all levels ?? apart from the technical ?? This movie stinks. Avoid.
