Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet with Robert Redford and he is really rich. He wants Demi, and since he is a gambler, he makes the couple an "indecent suggestion:" a million dollars a night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point, you don't have to watch the movie anymore because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If she doesn't, there's no first half of the movie. It will of course affect Demi and Woody's marriage. If it's not, there's no other half of the movie. And of course everything will turn out okay when the credits roll. If it doesn't, there's no happy ending because of the cashier's office. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing to say about INDEX PROPOSALS is that Demi Moore looks great in a black dress. As for the rest ... The scripture is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the notion is insignificant. I suppose Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the movie is mentioned. Make them - and more importantly for themselves - a service. Unless someone gives you a million ... Miss it! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
