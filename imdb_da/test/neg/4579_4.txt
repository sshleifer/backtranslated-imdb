Enough talent and sincerity went into making this movie as I wish it turned out better. Everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an exciting premise, but it is too deep a vision, for attempting to remove mental error to survive a transition to the screen. It is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid - the result is confused and slow. I give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.
