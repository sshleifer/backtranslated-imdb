TV Prize Shows that half of the time he is up for nominations in, comic relief, chat shows, quiz shows, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. Exactly when you bet, stop and think you can find salvation in the wireless, twang looks like good old JR. You like a freight train, no stops from Texas to downtown NY. It has lost an hour and is trying to make it up. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). It is a regular chat show format with JR As a host and a husband who is concise on four gay men (ha ha ha, ow my painful sides.) And season one had Andy Davis, but he left or was fired to make room to Ross's Ego. <br /> <br /> Ross wants less to use his guests as props, and you don't really hear them because of his attitude "it's my bullet and I take it home" you also see that the bigger the guest, The more he is willing to lie and suck up to them to enter the big boys (Like the weak child in school hanging around the bull). But when a little reality television star comes on, he will happily humiliate them, ask personal questions about the past and tell them about their lack of nt nt grin. Sometimes he will examine the popularity of the guests, say something to pamper them, and so when the audience seems shocked, he will quickly turn around and start making himself the fallen guy, the best example of this was when "Life On Mars" star John Simm came on, and he said, how does someone like you work for work, you look good, but not Hollywood fancy (Just in mind was Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry in the green room, he really tried to suck up to them before they was even on the couch). When the audience acted, Shock Ross said quickly: "What am I a little bit wanting from wearing the cross, I don't know what I'm saying". If he has no low form of television life, he will just dig the four gay men on the piano with jokes that are more outdated than his fashion. It's a very different story when a Hollywood A list or big TV star comes on the show, he'll tell them stories to humor them. When some actors explain that he was in a support band, Jonathon Ross would say something like "Wow, well I ever go to see a band I was trying to look interested in the support band, to make them feel like if they wanted to be "with an underlined message is" like me, I was probably one of those people who cheered you when you were in your band ". Higher this with an audience of Ross fans, so hooked on any bad old joke and bump, it really does for a bad show. <br /> <br /> It is better to see American chat shows instead, they are more scripted but not anywhere near as difficult to see.
