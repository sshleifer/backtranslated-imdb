With Al Jolson at the height of its popularity and Warner Brothers, the jazz singer has become the highest-selling movie from 1927, it was inevitable that the other studies would throw a few vehicles into their own Jolson esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation of being the first party talkie, the Matinée Idol lacks the voice of his star (the now unclear Johnnie Walker) and can only do with his visual antics. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol was an early directorial task for the famous Frank Capra. Capra's first few full-length features for Harry Langdon reveal a very flashy, overly-styled style, making Langdon already mediocre slapsticks almost unatchable. A few pictures later, and Capra has learned to ease a little, with something fairly regular and decent camera work. But he still shows no ability to shoot physical comedy. The longest comic routine - scene science - seems to have a few good gags, but it's all slashed into lots of different camera angles, and there's no chance of the comedy flowing naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a great deal of the jokes are in the headlines, but there are far too many of them, and none of them are particularly funny. Of course, Capra will eventually mature in a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him begin to develop in this regard. He cuts down the line and closes on Walker and Bessie's love in the scene where she first puts his eyes on him in his Don Wilson, erect and accurately establishes the wordless connection between them. Then there is some beautiful and beautiful framing of the couple in their scene together on the masquerade, all of which is reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra's early 30's production. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an extraordinary talent. His comic timing is good, but there is nothing to make him stand out. Bessie Love on the other hand is also a really good actress with a very expressive face. Kudos for her to get involved in the physical comedy and lose her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, the rat and jolly character actor who seems to appear in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s. Matinée Idol is one of the images gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director, who later made a handful of masterpieces. In itself, it is a very uninteresting piece, like most of Capra's work before he met Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
