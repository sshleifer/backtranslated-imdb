The one who looked like this to the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK knew for sure where he was talking about. He could also have looked like some of the adventures of the supremacy that followed. "Kay Hoog" reminds a little more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The shadow, the rare mystery man - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also considered to be a Kent Allard. If you were to take Savage's first name first and add to Kent, you end up with voila- Clark Kent. Fun, indit? ) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog is not over the pilfering of an ancient civilization's artifacts (though his thefts are often more obvious and less "charming roguish" than Jones). Unfortunately, these two parties are far from successive series (from any time) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is wrong with a film-historical tale is a scene where desperate horseback riding, literally breathing down, just watch as Hoog escapes their couplings in a hot air balloon. Why they don't bother shooting down the balloon is just one of the many film-creating mysteries that plague these two films. The other half of this two-party is even worse than the first. Admittedly, this was one of the first serial series, and as such it should be a bit lax - but there are even limits to tolerance. (At one point, the secrecy is not done on the screen, but in the story itself! Talk about cutting corners ...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers ever making movies; Unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, SPIDERS is a bitter pill actually swallowing ...
