I hated this movie. In short, this movie is so bad that I almost will ignore it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can't resist a good bashing. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does for the audience, it is that it brings out the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The movie (a sequel to the very funny Bruce Almighty) starts by reintroducing the audience to Evan Baxter, who only supports character in the original movie. It is true. This movie shows no Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a little cameo look. You know your movie is bad when the guy who went in to make Ace Venture: When Nature Calls doesn't even have a short walk-on role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. While sitting in the empty empty theater boring out of my heart because of a lack of comedy, I couldn't help wondering how much money it took to secure Freeman for this movie. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a throwaway role that takes up in all 20 minutes in 100 minute movies. God just jumps between scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Sure, I know Morgan Freeman won't be watching this movie in a year and think it's almost his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. Where was I? Oh yes, the reason. Sometimes it is so hard to keep the focus on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought to thinking about the plot than the writer's play did. Anyway Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently left his job as a news forum for a congressional member. Yes ... without transition between. He never turns to his wife and says "I think I'll be a congressman." It just happens within the first five minutes and you have to deal with the big transition. As a congressman, he must be a partner for a bill proposed by John Goodman's character when God suddenly appears to tell Evan to build a sheet. No "Hey, how are you? How's the weather?" bits. Just "I want you to build a sheet." Evidence of Bad Writing: Evan determines that God gives him traces of building a sheet after noticing a fan holding a sign that says Genesis 6:14 as he walks past his son if you watch a television baseball game . <br /> <br /> It is basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some random beneficiaries who do their best to create comedy, but they do not really do well because they do not get almost any screen time. It's just your basic run of the mill's family that builds a sheet film. Oh, and there is also the obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his walking plans with his children and wife because he is busy working. They go away disappointed, but they understand, like everyone else in the movies it has happened. Just once, I will love to see that the youngest child turns to his father and kicks him in the chin and tells him, "You're a real bastard to cancel your plans with us. I'll turn emo now." There is also the drama you would expect from the father with his family when they realize (wife, in fact ... the three children have no problem helping father build a sheet) that he has gone mad and he claims that God want him to build a big boat. But calm. His family decides to stick to him. Oops, I just spoiled the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is almost no good comedy. I know the decision was made to judge that this is a PG movie to get a bigger crowd response, but I don't think I'm in the minority when I think family humor is more than just guys being kicked in nuts and animals crapping. Maybe I'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to. And if it is, take me more adult comedies so I won't have to sit through more of this crap (saying not calculated). The end is extra cheesy. Suddenly, the movie takes a dramatic CGI-filled turn that makes me shake to think about how horrible a waste of CGI is. I bet it was expensive too. Finally, it explains why God wanted Evan to build a sheet. And boy, I hated the reason why. I save the details, but it was like looking at or reading a murderous mystery, and that the killer turned out to be the person behind the protagonist for a second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there is a good touch at the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays over the credits and we are then exposed to the "dance" of the casting. I do not understand it. They spend 100 minutes without making a comedy, and then they pack it up with a thriller. I swear I haven't been so scared to see Steve Carell dance since ... Now never. There you have that people. Evan Almighty is the horrible movie all the time. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought it was a wasted experience. I am confused by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) seen in this drill with Lauren Graham, the Gilmore Girls woman who has not yet proven that she can get out of a paper bag. But most of all, I am surprised by my willpower to actually sit through the entire movie without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
