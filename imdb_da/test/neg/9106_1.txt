This movie is not serious. Steve Guttenburg is constantly forcing his heavy guy into dialogue and then giving all the evil eyes all the time. He just wasn't trustworthy, he seems like he's trying to be a badass, and he sucks it. I just remember him as the millionaire's father with Olsen twins in It takes two ... so that's a big change. I rented this movie to Sean Bean and he dies (as usual). Only this time he was not placed on a boat anchor (Patriot Games), smashed by a giant dish (Goldeneye) or driven by cows (The Field). He was just shot, really fast and civil, and that was all I got from this movie that they didn't kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I only watched it in the 3 seconds Sean was in, and the rest was nonsense. I actually tried to see and understand the plot, but there really wasn't one. Seemed a little like Mission impossible with the hole, "Oooooo! There is a mole! It's the leader of the group, and no one expected it! Let's trap him! Let's hit the underdog's goodman so we can get away with it!" Cliched and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
