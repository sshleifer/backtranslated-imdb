Michael Allred's cartoon stories, especially his work with Madman, are usually very fun. "Astroesque" Allred is non-budget indy movie, the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> Worst acting ever combined with a truly horrible dialogue creates a brutal movie experience. Certainly Allred understands the WTF, but he is the only one. Daring you to see the whole mess is not enough ... to hesitate to see the whole mess is more on the target. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of movie recording for Allred's "Red Rocket 7" cartoon, which is ironically the most unreadable. So if your "Astroesque" experience is not horrible enough, you will definitely need to track down the over-sized comics and continue the fun. <br /> <br /> Pampered for Allred who was completely out of his depth to try a movie. I also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. Please purchase my VHS copy which is available right now on eBay. Hurry up.
