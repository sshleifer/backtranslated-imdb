Since I have to write at least 10 lines and this waste not only deserves a single, I start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this terrible so-called "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys, David Varod produce, are mainly shot in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (just in BTW, for the illiterate around - this country is in Europe that lies North of Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) Some years ago NOW has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly for video publishing. Why here? Because here they pay exciting low fees to the Bulgarian crew and to the Bulgarian actors (most of them prominent) who in many ways are better than most of their American counterparts. Personally, I'm ashamed of it. The reason, of course, is the greed of the concerned Americans and their desire to make the most, if not all, of the profits. In fact, it would not be that bad if only the production was not so dirty and pale. There has not been a good picture shot here for years. At present, the NU image has been sued here over the very questionable purchase of our national cinema production center called Boyana Films. There is no doubt that corruption has been fraud that has been lies in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
