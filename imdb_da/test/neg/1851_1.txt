If you are thinking of watching this movie then my advice is not. <br /> <br /> For me, the film failed to make the character at all levels and was a reminder of how serious most British (& Irish) films are. Forgettable tripe is the best I can say. If it had been on telly, I would have wandered to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I watched this movie with a group of friends, and after reading the press previews, you were prepared not to be critical and hopefully pass an entertaining 90 minutes. But, dear ones ..... <br /> <br /> As a comedy, it wasn't fun, as a thriller, the stupid story was blunt and lazy. As a love story absolutely incredible. Most of all, a piece of 'brilliant over the top whimsy' lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to make their money playing there ..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but apart from playing East End Gangsters and Jack Jacks, Michael Caine leaves you cold? <br /> <br /> In fairness some of my friends thought it was ok, but if you go, my advice is to get a few drinks (or puffs) in advance and let your critical faculties be securely locked at home. <br /> <br />
