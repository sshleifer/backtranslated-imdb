After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with stains of white paint sprayed on it, oh OK, I want to be generous and call it a star field, we are experiencing a foreign spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on the ground. A horrible-looking model spacecraft lands on a horrible-looking model field. Three nearby campers are investigating. From the burning spacecraft, a reptile appears to look alien, "Nightbeast", OK, so I lied it's a guy in a risky rubber mask and silver spaces. The campers are quickly killed by Nighbeast's laser gun, which shoots horrific special effects in humans. Cities Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) are informed. He warns his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a bag of men together to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast has killed an unfortunate driver who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying children are running for help. They approach a house, within two young kisses, the girl says "someone is running towards the house". The guy stands up to look and gets attacked and beaten by Nightbeast, it also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill the two children with his laser, maybe Nightbeast might not be that bad. When the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene, they have a gun / laser battle with Nightbeast. After possibly surviving the most erratic gunfight in film history only the Sheriff, his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel). But Nightbeast is still alive, bullets don't seem to have any effect on it. The next day, the Sheriff visits Mayor Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to be allowed to evacuate everyone in the city. He refuses to say that a party he holds to the governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be canceled and he does not want to create a panic situation. The sheriff is still evacuating the city. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. But they manage to scare off Nightbeast and survive. Along with the Sheriff's deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Posted and directed by Don Dohler, this must be an amateur movie, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many Dohler are involved. That is why I must cut it a little dull, but it still doesn't stop or apologize for being a very horrible movie in every department. It has no history or purpose, it just happens to waste time, what about Drago (Don Leifert), who curls his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many more scenes don't add anything to the movie. The script also has no logic, why keep Nightbeast around the city when it may. Is evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect an 80 spectrum would be ashamed of. There is not much blood or gore in it, a cracked open stomach, a cut arm and a beheading, but they all seem to be predictably bad. Credit where it is due, Nightbeast itself looks good most of the time. There is a sex scene between the Sheriff and his substitute, which one must see to be believed, music that even a porn would be embarrassed, and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to see. Less than starring, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real job to sit through. And the worse about this movie? It obliges the mortal sin to be boring and not fun at least. Sorry, you're a buddy, but don't give up the day job! Absolutely one to avoid.
