When I see a video like this, I have to ask myself how it was funded. HBO or Showtime or anything, have to pay for the production company to go through the movements - hiring someone who may or may not actually speak English to get high and hammer something approaching a plot to pay strippers with scary boob jobs to jump up and down on coarse-grown dudes' torso, to find people to design and light sets, to buy the rights to cheesy techno music, etc. But I have to imagine that this must be a vanity project for it Who serves as executive producer ... He should have nailed all these girls, right? And the bridge is not wrong with the "Spanish-looking" girl, but calling the police "stunning" is very generous. In fact, I will go as far as calling them something much closer to "ugly" or "fugly". Looking at these women screaming around - sometimes * clearly * high on painkillers - was so far from erotic that my testicles actually rose in my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time with this when there is so much free available hardcore porn on the Internet? I wonder if the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry ... You can only hope, don't you?
