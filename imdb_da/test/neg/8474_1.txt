The satirical movie website Dateline Hollywood shot that "The Mask's Son" was a handy joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for her show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment." If only. And if only the movie had been half as fun as the satire piece. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle to face Jim Carrey, who saw so many viewers; It also welcomed men over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a follow-up minus both was not a good idea, plus you would have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after "Dumb and Dumber: When Harry Met Lloyd." But no ... even though it is fair, it is entirely in line with the original cartoon (where the mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman, there is nothing in return, except a steady stream of decent decent FX at the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic enhancement on "Ally McBeal" dancing baby and their own "Baby Day Out "with Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering for cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as" Siamese Popes ") naming its character after Tex Avery, and works in not only references to classic comics, but actual clips. The problem is that the last approach doesn't really work, partly because most attempts to bring the comics to live action fall flat (especially the cars come in the party mood) and mostly because the tribes of Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and Especially "One Froggy Evening" shows how weak this movie is in comparison. Plus the film fits in the shambolic slapstick along with the strained feeling (history's underlying theme is family, our hero is not ready to have a son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norwegian god Loki - is far from Odin's apple eye ... and what Bob Hoskins does here as Odin, even after "Super Mario Bros." is beyond me), and Kennedy is not in the same league as Carrey in the big stakes - even though it is not as he gets any help from the script. Also note that the very sweet Traylor Howard (as the mother of the son of the mask), unlike Diaz, doesn't get much to do; giving the mask could have helped the movie. <br /> <br /> Additional points are lost to throw away Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously shortened maturity (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seemingly lacking); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inner joke when ours totally does not sell the term "green guy" as an animated television series - "The Mask" became an animated television series in fact and was a far better follow up than this sequel . The fact that this actually opened in the UK before the US was to tell it all about it ... What about this and "Blade: Trinity" New Line seems to try to bend the market on terrible successors with cast members from "Two Guys And A Girl. "What next," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone stops this.
