This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are socially committed - have jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations where they cannot afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found some of the women who were interesting but there was little focus or progression in history. The direction and editing failed to keep my attention. There were, of course, differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on one of them in more detail. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty boring journey.
