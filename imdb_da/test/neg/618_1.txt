Lance Henriksen has the advantage of being the top name in a B movie, even in this case starring Charles Napier, the Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a good job of being the bad guy, but the reason is just bad (not even getting me to the end). And editing is so awful, it can actually be a beauty issue. Is it just me, or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was split into the movie at the last minute? Also, whenever glass is broken in this movie, editing is so anti-phenomenal. Finally, after seeing this, I see that David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, it will be the third movie I give a rating of 1/10, Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.
