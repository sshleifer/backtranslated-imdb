The only reason I know this movie exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon had been on since Life Facts ended. When I searched for her name, this relatively new TV movie came up. After much investigation, I managed to find a copy and was thoroughly disappointed with what I was looking at. D Grade acting, bad script, horrible FX - it was like watching a toned down, more stupefied version of Day After Tomorrow that went on for 3 hours. Despite the long running time, the characters remain rather underdeveloped, we care about them at least and leave in most cases after their death. Combine it with horrible lighting and filmography, and you have a real disaster in a movie. How they committed so many "name" actors (ie Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to come up with such a waste is thinking. In summary - I want the 3 hours in my life back !!!
