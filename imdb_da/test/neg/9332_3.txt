Mostly involved biblical mumbo jumbo that draws on well over two hours. The only thing that saves this movie from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentional fun dialogue and a good fight scene that comes too late in the movie. In most of the two hours until the action scenes are too much to speak; The dialogue is so unfortunate that the movie just desires to be spoofed by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely horrible; one of the most animated, all-theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his stiff wood business combined with the horrible fortune-tune cookie wisdom signs make it a rather boring and silly Salomon. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth something is wise and ridiculously loud and mighty come out. To a degree it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, because of the crazy, comical dialogue and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they did a little effort otherwise. Brynner accent even reminds a bit of Schwarzenegger's; This is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing himself by playing the role of more conviction and appropriately, which is a role in such a silly movie. Describing these biblical signs as one-dimensional would also be giving them undeserved credit; the characterization is semi-dimensional.
