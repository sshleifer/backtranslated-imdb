Can't liberal like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the election in 2000 and 2004? The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-professional workers, George W. Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film, just makes him stupid and bitter on the screen. As the credits, the sour grapes roll on as "Special Thanks" to Ken Lay and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone. Let me bind you to something - if you put all your money in a company's store, you're an idiot. We don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that. What a waste of Jim Carry's talent - from the trailer I expected a completely different movie - what I got was a 90 minute DNC advertisement on how to scare people into not investing in their own future, keeping them stupid and keeping them dependent on the government . No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore - maybe you can get an original idea and put it on the screen for once ... although I shouldn't be surprised when Jane Fonda was thrown into the original.
