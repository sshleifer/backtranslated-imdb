Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This sticky movie version of its 1950's short story about time travel and the effect it can have on the development is not known from the theatrical race (did it have one?) And now exists as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week. What seems to be a fabulous sci-fi thriller from the opening scene quickly despaires us as the computer-generated graphics are reused unchanged through a movie about different 'tours' back in time when a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. A slip of the foot / butterfly while on one of these ventures and evolution evolves with resulting time waves rolling over the planet, changing everything to human plants and beasties. Of course, there is a beautiful lady who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man who risks her life acting on her orders and everything is finally ok. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the story ... and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted, abysmally recorded clutter on a movie is that it attracted some fine talent to depict the comic flat characters. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the necessary bad corporate guy who cultivates a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the well-known woman-creator and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil - all are amazing actors and should have known better than adapting to this flop. And the shameful thing is for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers, the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen for a long time. A must miss. Grady Harp
