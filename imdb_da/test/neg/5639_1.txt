When I listen to my parents, seeing this (after I gave 10 minutes in the movie), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. When "Charles Dickens" stared into the camera, I half expected him to become a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, this has not happened. <br /> <br /> This movie had different reasons, I didn't finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said and the characters were badly introduced. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like a lot of speeches, no action, horrible plays, cheesy laughs and the same music / sound effects are played over and over again, then this is the movie for you .. . <br /> <br /> 1/10 - horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
