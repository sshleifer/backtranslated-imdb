I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it could be a real action thriller. No, it is instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is undoubtedly a cable movie and not one for the theater. Fortunately, after 90 minutes, movies stop or the audience should have taken an anti-sleep virus. One thing came over: it was the lovely country the movie has been shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit. It's not a must see because my wife and I voted on average 4/10.
