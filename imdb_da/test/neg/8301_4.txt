Although I had previously seen this on Italian television, I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time around, buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces (including a confused Joseph Cotten as Baron) and, unlike many, another movie of The Euro-Cult subgenre, an eventful plot instead of blunt pacing. <br /> <br /> The creature itself looks a little risky, and Cotten is a little too old to be taken seriously as an avid scientist who still stumbles on creating life forms out of the bodies (one would have thought he would having made an army of them now and not struggling to complete his technique yet, but Mrs Neri looks good in costume and reliably Herbert Fux is probably best as a lecherous tomb robber / chanting.
