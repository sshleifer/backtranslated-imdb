It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Pretty concise review I know, but it has been a long time since a movie has left me in such a confused state - wondering how the hell a movie is like. <Br /> <br /> The last time it happened was last year Turkey 'Mission to Mars'. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is an ex-con - trying to improve itself through self-help videos, endless seminars and improvement courses. He lives by catchphrases these courses expound. <br /> <br /> He stumbled upon a rinsed nightclub singer, played by Nikki Bennett and has an epiphany; His new career is going to be a talent agent - with the singer as his only client. Funded by his evangelical song, paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler - he creates a store and tries to resume Nikki's career with outrageous results. <br /> <br /> 'Walk the Talk' is why Australians are so devoted to Australian cinema. It is poorly constructed, lame and far too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should hardly have scraped 80 minutes of ground). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. The audience is not given a sign of empathy; An important ingredient in a movie like this is probably an "underdog" that gives it a try. <br /> <br /> The downbeat and frankly bad end comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most sensible emotional dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure. <br /> <br /> This movie is a failure at all levels - aggravated for the Queensland audience by its liberal and innacurate use of various Gold Coast / Palm Beach locations; and its ridiculous use of Brisbane suburb names such as Norman Park and Caboolture.
