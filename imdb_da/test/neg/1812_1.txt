The movie Heart of Darkness is an insult to the book of Joseph Conrad! To be quite honest, the movie made me fall asleep. On the other hand, the book was certainly extraordinary. I feel that the film has omitted several key elements and missed some of the main points in the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. The book, but not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meaning and interesting phrases in the plot. The book, although very confusing and complex, is amazing. When you finally understand it, you feel like you have actually learned something. The Novella, or a short story, had several keywords such as present and craziness that the film went out of. In addition, several key scenes were changed, which in turn affected the entire plot. Many of the scenes seemed to be very "choppy" in the sense that they didn't fit together. In summary, the film seemed to be a poor interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend watching this movie if you can't picture or understand the book, but otherwise I would skip this one. It was terrible and in complete disarray. If you've never read the book, you definitely don't have to watch the movie because you need the basics of the book to understand the movie. The movie was a horrible spin-off of an excellent and detailed book.
