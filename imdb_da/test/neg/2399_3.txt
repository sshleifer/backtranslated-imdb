I'm sure the people who made this movie think they are doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize US wars in Afghanistan and especially Iraq by suggesting that the United States is doing good, but do not clean up afterwards, then the seeds for future problems. In addition, they do this without making the Islamists enemy and without making the republicans the enemy, as it is the republicans who are in government and who do this probably good, to bring down the Soviet Union with hidden delivery of a war in Afghanistan. <br /> But seriously now. . . we really want a movie that repeatedly says "let's kill some Russians!" Such is the greatest thing a red-blooded American can do? And should we find this congressman sweet because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and reveals clothes? Even his supposedly smart assistant, who is always dressed professionally, looks at Charlie as if he were just the most wonderful, loveliest, greatest guy around. Like she's Nancy Reagan for her Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a bang-up work in her role, but in fact women are really discouraged in this movie and it was really annoying.
