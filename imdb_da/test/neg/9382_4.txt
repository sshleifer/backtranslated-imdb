It starts quite well, but after a while you start to expect more from this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and unclear, it remains. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after being transferred to the capitalist country, here is the Czech unofficial but well-known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING ALL THEY LIKE GOOD GOOD WHEN THEY SEE IT IN OTHER FILES OR COUNTRIES elsewhere. I think this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "scare" and "humor" and "movie" and money. And it remains for me / One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which cannot be compared to this movie in the way of ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. It could be done better. At least they tried. Excuse the guys. :-( CANOT NOT Recommend
