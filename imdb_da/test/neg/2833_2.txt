This was not a good movie. Poor script and act - the concept was not new, the effects poor and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo, who is really a half-decent actor. I saw this during a protest and remembered only to have seen it before at the end - it's forgotten. The play seemed to consist of a number of glares and looks without any sincerity. I expect this to actually get going, and for a long time I just hoped it would be finished. What about the medical bits - I didn't expect a real version of ER events, but it was just comical - I'm a Dr so know what I'm doing - and the operational bits were simply stupid. Don't waste your valuable time - unless you absolutely don't have anything else to do - go out, call a long lost friend, see paint dry, sort your sock drawing, do some housework. Avoid avoiding your danger.
