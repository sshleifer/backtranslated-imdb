I remember seeing the very first trailer to Underdog back in March last year. I also remember at the time that smiled to myself ever so little. Sure it was a cheesy idea, but I really thought at the time the concept could work, hell, it couldn't be worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could? So in December and I suddenly remembered the movie, I realized how likely the movie would suck, the fact that it had been delayed in the UK, made it inevitable, it would be terrible, but the horrible reviews just made me realize that was close to impossible for the movie to be good. I still turned off my emotions and went to watch the movie with a friend today when I entered my screen, I was rooted. It was the first time I wanted to watch a movie with a friend and be the only two on the screen! Little did I know what I was about to endure. Underdog to say it is dumb is terrible, it really is. Imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse, it's just as pathetic the movie is. While aiming to entertain children, it just seems like an embarrassing mess that seems to offend children, rather than letting them enjoy the movie. Matters can't be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lackluster, the action is generally bad, and the movie just feels like an overlaid, tired and even boring Saturday cartoon! After a short five minutes, when I thought the movie could be passable, the movie suddenly seems to die and then lags against the already signed final. I'm just amazed that the movie was actually ever released, it's a shame for Disney, the hell half of them just for video sequels are better than this! What is even more frightening is that the end leaves room for a successor! <br /> <br /> Let's get into the actors (cracks). Okay let me be honest Jason Lee is decent, his voice fits the dog, and if he has got a proper script, he may have made the show. But with such a dizzying script he just seems to float. In many ways, it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make it acceptable. Then we come into the human actors, and well the majority of terrible. Alex Neuberger plays Underdogs, Jack's friend. My biggest concern is that someone would even take him seriously in an audition. The scene where he is going to fly with Underdog is perhaps the most worthy scene in the past few years, just because his performance is so poor. Not once did I think he was a real person, in fact, part of me is still convinced that he was a robot specially made for the movie! James Belushi seems half dead in the movie, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the seat and waits to become relevant to the plot, which the authors are trying to do to the end, but make it such a bad way is ridiculous. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is the only redeeming factor in the film, he is fantastic as Dr. Barsinister and seems to have a laugh in the role. He steals every scene he's in, even though it's not difficult when he shares the screen with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the role is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just needs to finish her acting career right now! Underdog also fails dramatically in delivering something like a fun scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and getting dog food to explode everywhere, you know, there's something drastically wrong. This could easily be ignored if the movie had a decent action or a good story, unfortunately the film is even worse in both of these terms. The effects are so ropey that any scene in which Underdog flies just seems absurd, and the dog uses its power for the little effect you often forget he has superpowers. What is the purpose of making a movie about a super dog if the damned dog never seems super? Finally, the fight also fights for embarrassingly clean, because its ten minutes of nothing, the dog flies, other things happen, some things are chucked about, all this is irrelevant, as this thing happens for things to happen. The script is at best also risky and fair pain inducing terrible at worst. When someone says "It's a plane, it's not a bird, it's not a seed ...", yes you read it right, I just wanted to burst into tears there and then. In fact, I was going to be forced to see if it could get anything lower than the point it almost made at the end, so fortunately it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Underdog becomes the worst movie from 2008 at this early period, and is actually just as bad as last year's Epic Movie. Luckily for the Underdog, meet the Spartans arriving here quickly and I expect it to get even worse. So if you didn't get points on my review, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to watch a movie with a dog, then look and cat, buy a real dog, if necessary, just don't look at this!
