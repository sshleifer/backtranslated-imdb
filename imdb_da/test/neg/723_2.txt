In the beginning I thought 'nasaan ka man' could be one of the progressive new Filipino movies. As someone noted earlier, the film doesn't look bad. Clearly, the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better audio equipment, great players, and nicer places. <br /> <br /> But the improvements are only superficial. If that were not the case for all Polish and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel like your typical, second-largest local film - hyperactive drama, predictable plot twists, "yes right!" moments, crying, screaming, and signs you could lessen, all pushed into your throat. <br /> <br /> A few things annoyed me about this movie. First of all, when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that non-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. Secondly, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know the director was trying to make things look super dramatic, but I was simply forced to turn on the brightness of my TV.
