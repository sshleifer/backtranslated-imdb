I seemed to find trailers better than the movie. They did their job and made me interested to see UNKNOWN. Interest rates fell early. A simple premise that does in nature. Five men wake up in a chemical store without knowing why they are there; let alone know how the hell did they get there. Confusion and paranoia cause fear and mistrust. The men learn that a kidnapper is on the road with plans to kill his hostages. Now the men are the size of each other by trying to distinguish whether everyone is a victim and who can actually be one of the kidnappers. The game includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
