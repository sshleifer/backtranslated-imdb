I watched this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival and would not recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, where nothing much happens at a wading-through-porridge pace. The protagonists are helpless and lacking in charisma or personality. No one smiles at all during the film (even if I had their life) and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she doesn't seem to have sex at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and obscure, the manager directed over every scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than beating me with the beauty of his technique. <br /> Too many questions were left in my heart: why does he sniff the Algerian man's head? Why does he experience it? What does he look at over the fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go and see this nonsense instead of ordering another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?
