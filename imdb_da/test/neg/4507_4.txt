This is a by-the-number horror movie with Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a psychologist duo who buys and old mansion and invites a small crew of friends and patients to help clean up. Unknown to them, the palace has a cellar door - the gate to hell. If you're in the mood for a clich√©d horror movie, look no further, but if you want something ingenious then this little movie won't appeal to you. <br /> <br /> STILL: $$$ dampened, albeit the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw - some cruel mind for you. Fans of inventive death scenes will not like this, as all signs seem to be electrocuted somehow). NUDITY: $ (Nothing to talk about. Mary Louise Weller adds good looks, but her character was underdeveloped). STORY: $$ (Cliched, but worthy of anyway. This doesn't give any news to the genre but the casting of Victor Buono - almost as needy as a Santa department store - seems to have attracted a few viewers). ACTING: $$ (The best performances are of the Crenna and the Pette with Other actors "just loading" their roles. The actor fails to develop any characters beyond the character of Pett and seemed to have forgotten Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) who disappears in about twenty minutes and only recharges to be electrocuted like everyone else in a dull way).
