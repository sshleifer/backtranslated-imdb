I suppose I should take something like this with a grain of salt. These lab films (and yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab) always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that individuals are fooling around, uncovering secrets beyond the understanding of someone for this time. Of course, they pay a price because their experimentation has the same shortcomings as Dr. Frankenstein did. There is always something they do not foresee. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here. The young woman picks up safely and the doctor cannot help herself, but he could have been a little discreet or even made an effort to pay tribute to what he did. Things go wrong, and because of this intellect she gets enormous power, including an understanding of how she came to be. Rock Hudson looks great here. However, he never really does that in this role. It wanders around with lots of clich√©s and silliness that reduce the basic problem. When she has her revenge, a more appropriate thing would be for her to walk and let him seek her and destroy her in some great way.
