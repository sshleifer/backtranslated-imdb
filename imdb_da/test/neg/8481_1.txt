(Contains really bad Spoilers) So what can I say about this .... It's a really horrible and horrible movie !!. Too much CGI and special effects .... you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is !!. at least go see the "Dungeons and Dragons" which is another horrible pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes the Dungeons and Dragons way better !!! Owl !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this trash !! I would also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably just as stupid as "Mask's son". "BabyGeniuses 2 was as fake as" Mask's Son "and also contains way too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway Yeah ... this was a bad bad really bad movie .... just please Avoid it .... DO NOT recommend it to anyone ... please just too ridiculous .... make no sense and really bad plot. The baby looking at his father was just lame!
