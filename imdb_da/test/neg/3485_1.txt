I was fortunate enough to grow up surfing in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a childhood hell, I want to tell it) and I have seen many so-called surf flicks in my life. After looking at NORTH SHORE for the first time right now, all I can say is THANK YOU GOD, I never saw this as a child. If I had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic depiction of the surf scene, I would sell my board and all the way in, I don't know, accounting or anything. <br /> <br /> Serious movie has so much in common with true surfing, as TOP GUN has been a true military life. The action is horrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is iffy at best and OH MY GOD, what was Laird Hanilton thinking ?! WOW !!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! IT STINKS!!! If you want a REAL surf flick, see RIDING GIANTS. Hell, see SURF'S UP instead of this. Seriously. Sucks. Sucks bad. Sucks REAL bad. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: Shift my summer from "WTF?!" for wtf, because we seem to whisper on this site. NO GOD !!! (Shhhhh!); D
