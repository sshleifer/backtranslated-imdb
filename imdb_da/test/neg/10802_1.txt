But at least this movie got what he deserved - to be sent to Satellite of Love to be ridiculed by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of the long-standing, forgotten movies that is so bad that you will be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later in life. Although the film is not so old, it is still a very forgotten type of movie. If it had never been for the intelligent minds of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not only seem like it was made, but the movie would not be much fun by our movie guests. <br /> <br /> In fact: This movie is really bad. In Satellite of Love: This movie is excellent!
