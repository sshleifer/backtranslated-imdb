One of the few film films recorded at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ in the late 80s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Just Perfect (which was a segmented movie game under Mickey Mouse Club.) Movie is intended for children as the previous comments are right on. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, Coronado has undergone a review and many of the buildings seen in this movie are now gone. The field where they play catches adjoins the football field, one of the few areas still there. The internal scenes near the cupboards I believe were in the old 200 building. <br /> <br /> Unless it plays late at night on the Disney Channel, it can be very difficult to find flick. How they have ever made follow-up to this is over me.
