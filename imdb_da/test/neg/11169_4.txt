Today, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and reflection of today's society. This is not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre slasher movie heavily derived from American films such as "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream". The reason is well known - 5 teenagers commit accident crimes, but cover it with asking for secrecy. A year later, they are stalked by a knife-waving madman (with the decisive unclear disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit). It does not help that teens are a generally unlikely group (this is one of those films where the killer is motivated) and there are many stupid plot settings to keep the story going. The movie's direction is uninhibited, more influenced by MTV than by the current Asian horror films (like "The Ring"). The last third of the movie is not that bad, but delivers some decent excitement scenes, but there is probably a "twist" for many in the end. 4.10
