You know, I always want to disturb or weird movies, especially when they are shown at the fantasy film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. will this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I just didn't understand this movie. but what can you expect from a girl who was introduced to a festival crowd? We know that not all of you will see this in the end. /> I like splatter movies and I also like movies with a strong graphic language. But this? There are many bloody scenes in this, but why? What does the instructor seek to tell us? does he say we lost all morals and all religious feelings? Or does he say that incest will always end in a disaster? who knows - I don't. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for some time - see it. but don't expect to think "wow, i got the message" - i didn't get it ...
