If there was justice in the cinematic universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never be allowed to put a foot on a movie set again. It seems unthinkable that anyone who spent two full decades in an editing room where LS started his film career could be so completely devoid of any pacing or dramatic breakdown, but this movie is amazing evidence. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, it's fascinating so. From the opening scene, where a nurse is dressed in a costume that is only suitable for a porn movie or a shit on a Mexican black exhibition, the viewer is forced to see how low it can go. The answer is not far away, as in the next scene we move to a funeral home where the next amazing fashion statement comes in a sexy, black shoulder black dress worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate costuming is not the only fault of the movie. The dialogue is a treat for the connoisseurs of poor writing. "You turn my tears into wine," is a sample gem. The actor deserves an Oscar to deliver one with a straight face. The director reinforces all the cheeseball scenes with what may be the schmaltziest soundtrack score ever recorded, jumping from embarrassing maudlin in dialogue scenes to cheesy groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters without rhyme or reason, and the story is turned out as if with a broken bow. Let's not forget this is a "horror" movie, though. Our characters are in a forest where Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" henchwomen, who should be a kind of Frankencreatures, but look just like Valley Girls with fake blood dabbed under their Supercut shags. I have honestly seen scarier make-up on eight-year-old trick-or-treating on Halloween. <br /> <br /> And again, we get a whiff of the costume designer's vicious craftsmanship, which Valley Ghoul One prances around in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend smock, while her girlfriend wears a non-descriptive ensemble that may have been almost fashionable in smaller hip corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper makes the big fashion statement however resembles a Crisco cowboy lost in the woods on his big black Harley, dressed from head to toe in zippered black S&M leather. <br /> <br /> If this sounds exciting, everything means checking it out. There are lots of side-cutting and immersed dialogue (like the noble "elephant cemetery" scene or the "intellectual" discourse on Ginsburg). To be fair, the cinematography is good, considering what was set before the camera, and the actors strive (with extremely extreme results) to do something from a scrap of clich√©s and inanities. You have to wonder if they were really really stupid or just blindly desperate, not going off the set after catching a glimpse of the ridiculous villains with their 99 Cent Big Arms.
