If you are a 6 year old boy who is in dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, roll your eyes every 15 seconds. If you want to start picking on things like the play, special effects, the dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that gives the least amount of meaning, you have plenty of material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, it will just work fine. That said, there are a lot of kids entertainment out there that is much smarter, and some of it is even tolerable or comfortable for adults. Unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood, you're probably better off looking for something else.
