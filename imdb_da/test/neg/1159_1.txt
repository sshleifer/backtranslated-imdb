Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers all the time, was the inspiration for famous film killings such as Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, I saw a documentary on him, so I know his story quite well. When I saw this, I was curious because I thought it should be a documentary resumption, but I have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are completely wrong, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, it was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrible murders really happened and they just made it a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they were to make it a horror movie, this was badly acted! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole city is being carried out by digging dead bodies and brutally killing people. Bobby, a deputy, is on the case to get Ed Gein, only no one knows who the killer is in the first place, just finding the crime scene after the crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed begins to trade with the policeman's family and friends. Of course, this movie was just ridiculous and totally insulting to the true story. I have always thought that bad action is a necessary tool for a horror-flick, but for this story it should have been a better-functioning movie, not to mention, it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clich√© movie. Stay away from this movie, it's totally pathetic and unlikely with Ed Gein's story. <br /> <br /> 1/10
