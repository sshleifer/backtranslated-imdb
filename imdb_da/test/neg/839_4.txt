There are significant amounts of money behind this production, so the look of it is very good. It contains some interesting performances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns, and a short cameo at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are a couple of exciting warfare, and a humorous piece or two-satire at Django, the Man of No Name, and Sabata are entertaining, especially when they get the names of the failed Presidents of the Mexico Revolution. <br /> The problem is, there is no purpose in satirizing Spaghetti Western as it is attempted here. The key element of Spaghetti is IRONY, which easily blends into comedy; In fact, the source of all Spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies from time to time, and most Spaghetti's easily slipped over the edge in true comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps there is the best evidence of this in the Trinity films, both of which are open Spaghetti and openly slap-stick comedy. So why do satirization bother to create a genre that - in its nature - is satirizing itself? Therefore, I found the whole company essentially convincing. None of these characters were people I would ever break, the story was generic cliché, and the production values ​​reflected only the money involved, not the director's passion. All in all, it is a trivial and cumbersome effort to get into the phenomenon.
