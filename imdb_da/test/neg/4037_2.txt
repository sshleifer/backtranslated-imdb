I let a friend talk to me about watching this movie, and all I can say is - I'll kill that friend. <br /> <br /> It is an hour and a half in my life, I will never come back and I will always regret it. <br /> <br /> If you have also had the misfortune of watching this movie, you would agree with me that this is definitely the worst movie ever made! <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie and are thinking of watching it - let me save you a waste of time and warn you: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, THE SUCCER !!!! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sexiness - it just looks stupid, unclear and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are actually attractive and sexy and not obese, ugly and brutal to look at! <br /> <br /> The play is ridiculous as it is in writing. It was clear that this was made by total amateurs, I can't believe these people were allowed to make such a silly movie, isn't there a law against it? There must be. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good "b" movies if you are in that kind of thing, but don't save time on this crappy wanna-be movie. <br /> <br /> PEACE
