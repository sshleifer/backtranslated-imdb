This movie was a pretty strange experience. The film is of course based on a game. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works fine in a game, but for a movie it's just not that terribly interesting to look at. The movie is far too 'stagey' and they haven't even bothered to change some of the dialogues to make it more appropriate for a movie. Instead, what is now presented is an almost literal re-filming of a stage game with over-the-top characters and staged dialogue. Because of all this, the story does not go right, and the film becomes an almost complete drill and outdated experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while before you find out that this is a comedy you're seeing. In the beginning you think it's a drama you are watching, with crooked characters in it, but when the film progresses, you will notice that the film is more of a tragicomedy that leans more towards the comedy genre, rather than the drama boundary. <br /> <br /> The characters and dialogue are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top, which sometimes gets really unatchable. Yes, the players are big; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but they do not raise the film to a level that can be seen enough. <br /> <br /> History feels completely disoriented. Basicaly story is about nothing and focuses primarily on the brother / sister character played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story about? The film feels like a pointless and outdated one that has very little to offer. Like I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to see on the scene, but as a movie, it's really not appropriate and simply doesn't work. Editing is simply awful and times, and it gets ridiculously bad in some sequences. <br /> <br /> More was to be expected from director J. Lee Thompson, who, of course, has made far better movies than this little failed, scene play translated into screen project. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
