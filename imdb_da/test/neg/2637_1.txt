Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which of us knew the "worst movie all the time". Needless to say, one won the hands down. It is long and pulled out and has no purpose or plot from what I can collect. A movie about a murderer child raised from a fetus grown outside the womb has just no place in your vcr. If you are very bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you prefer your beauty, stay away.
