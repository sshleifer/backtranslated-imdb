When the Underdog comic book debuted in 1964, at age 7 I was immediately connected. He was Top Dog (saying calculated) in my book- (that is, until Batman premiere on ABC a year or so later). Even when it was clear that Disney was going to make a live-action version of the once popular Saturday morning cartoon, it was just as clear to me that it should be a piece of shit. Even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this. But I made it a point that: a) Never try to write a review unless I've seen the movie from start to finish; and b) never use a red cent on a movie that I'm almost sure I will hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) is fully qualified to write this review; and b) it cost me only 84 minutes of my hard earned time. It also shows my point, namely that this film is not just a piece of shit. It is a steaming pile of dog animals. It just looks like the TV series, even though they almost got it right with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which luckily I didn't have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * out of *****
