I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast ?? Walter Pidgeon in a role reminiscent of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musical inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a love for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie, but I had trouble keeping awake. Lorre was heavily underused. I think he was a red herring, like Pidgeon? You expect him to have to go and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark container. No such luck. By the way, why is there a shark container on a submarine? It is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre walks the shark back and forth (because we see it), but just expects us to accept the fact that there is a shark on this part for some reason. "Research?" Yes, scientists always do the research staff who can understand them? Of course, if there wasn't a shark, who would kill the evil psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even children's films in the 50s are capable of being less predictable and honestly idiotic (not to mention exploitative). The first 10 or 15 minutes really got my hope. Great theme song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon Leading Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear actually regrets Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, beware of skipping the room with the big "WARNING" sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks and then we see a full-screen picture of Eden shaking her moneymaker to Avalon's eerie horn play! The film goes downstream quickly. There is no real explanation for the four-storm that threatens the Earth, so there is a clear lack of dramatic excitement and no villain to start. Instead, Pidgeon's character is created for a convincing red herring vaguely of the Ahab variety (I think "The Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly gets hurt without any reason at the end. Oh, I suppose it's a surprise to the audience. And that is a little surprising, since the only negative thing she has done is to talk badly about the captain's mental health, and there is still no reason why she did the sabotage after she's revealed to be the villain. Very poorly done and convincing. The guy who was the pessimistic Bible nut was better ?? at least his character was sensible. <br /> <br /> What else could go wrong? Endless, interminable scuba-diving footage. I never understand the appeal of that kind of thing. A gigantic squid attacks the ship for a moment, just so there's a monster for the theatrical trailer. Maybe it fools some people into thinking it would be a fantasy adventure movie, rather than a half-baked thriller about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? Perhaps worst of all, it is hardly a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie. It never did anything for my imagination, because the whole premise was nothing but a disaster / apocalypse, and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery. I'm through with Irwin Allen. However, I have never had his later films, but one of them made me pretend to be Jules Verne, as it really is just another formal exercise in catastrophe. The whole movie is just waiting to see, which character will be unlikely to turn evil and die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a charming and personable screen person to play these roles, and that is the only element of "surprise" that exists, as there is no logic to these characters anyway. What a pathetic waste of time for these actors. George Pals movie is 100 times better (the only one who was lame was "Atlantis", which was not by chance the most Allen-esquire), full of wonder and excitement and ?? Think about it! ?? ideas! Apart from a few effects scenes and Barbara Eden, there is nothing worth seeing here in my opinion. I think it's fun for those in disaster movies, but I think they're a hole and boring genre of movies.
