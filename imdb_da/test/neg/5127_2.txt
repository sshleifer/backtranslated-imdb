Flashdance is one of the horrible, stupid movies that you actually enjoy just because they are so bad. I was just watching TV and my friend and I were amazed at how bad it was. It is true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of ​​a rather cheap, lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of (admittedly catchy) pop, so Flashdance is a strange kind of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne started in advertising and it shows because Flashdance is almost a commercial for itself. You've already decided to see it, but the movie has this weird, panic undercurrent, as if it's afraid you might change your mind at all times. It continues to sell itself to you over and over, all the way through slender commercial style editing and glossy close-ups of jigging breasts. The story is wafer thin (I honestly can't think of another movie I've seen with less plot), and it never makes much sense, but it's a very constructed calculation film so it feels consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance was always rubbish. Viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy T&A, but it works in its own stupid way. There is a rambling romance for the chick-girl crowd and stacks of oily, swirling female bodies for their dates, all set to a pumping disco beat. How could it fail? It helps that the dialogue is meaningless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing something bigger, and if that kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the "interpretation dance" on the display. The scene where a stand-in for Jennifer Beals cramps / 'dances' on stage in front of a TV with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in stitches. A real guilty pleasure.
