I rented this movie when my boyfriend was gone and hoped to see some serious military / specialized acts. After 10 minutes of watching this "movie" I was so horrific and horrified and sick of the quality of everything In this movie I was ready to destroy the rented slice with a flame removal. Luckily I couldn't find one. I've seen many bad movies. But it's not even bad, it's total waste, and it doesn't even deserve to be spoken as a movie here at IMDB. I'm sorry for the people who have been involved in making this total disgrace. Hope it wins some Oscars themselves: D.
