CONGO is probably the worst big budget movie from the 1990s. It is so bad that it can be seen again and again. A bunch of people with different agendas are deeply disturbed in the darkest of Africa, where they meet a temple of wealth like in KING SOLOMON'S MINES - but with cannibalist gorillas guarding these riches. On their side, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy who helps save the day at some point. So much for the plot. The dialogue all the way is unclear, the play is almost uniformly horrible, safe campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both ready to secure him factor), and the special effects are scary. Wait until you see the cannibalist gorillas. And lava! Oh yes, have I mentioned that there is a volcanic eruption to get out of the grand finale? Laura Linney of all people is together for this bumpiest of rides. What could she have thought? It's about the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.
