I saw DEATH MACHINES as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics' (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. As I work through the many DVDs, I grow to love many of Crown International's films - especially the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> KILLS are not one of them. <br /> <br /> Having watched movies like MALIBU BEACH, CREEPING TERROR and THE RED ANGELS, it's hard to say this is the worst movie ever made; But that doesn't matter a lot. <br /> <br /> No plot; really no story to talk about. The action is not clear ?? Only the actor responsible for the terribly played Tony (with the thick fake Italian accent) made every attempt to "get into character". <br /> <br /> The result is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is why ... what forced the filmmakers to make this movie? <br /> <br /> Did they believe the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing criminal bosses, 3) a bartender / karate school student character and 4) his pitiful love nurse was so convincing that the world would not be complete without that this movie was made? <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, the authors, the actors and the director.
