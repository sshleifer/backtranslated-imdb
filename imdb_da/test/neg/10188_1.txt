This movie was a great bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a UFO movie. Well ....... I think she starred in this movie to help a friend or friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie was not what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO meetings. Cheap! As the film progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was fun where almost everyone in the film had solid colors. (There are a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was verrryyy disappointing. She is always found in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has returned to the fold. Does she never leave home? <br /> <br /> I had to extinguish the movie several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe in this movie's message - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change beyond love, not to celebrate.
