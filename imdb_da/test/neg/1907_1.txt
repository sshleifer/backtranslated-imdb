Interferencia starts as free Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and arranging to meet her. Soon after Martin reads a local paper and sees frontpage the story of a prostitute being murdered and thinking back to what he heard. Martin tells his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) & Aaron (Oliver Kolker), but they don't believe him. So shortly after that, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and her death are reported again in the papers. Martin decides to find the killer and put an end to his killing, but who is it? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production, which apparently was shot in just eight days (why so long?) on a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I can't believe in some of the glowing comments Interferencia has on IMDb. Out of 195 user reviews as I write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10, I'm sorry but there is no way anyone should give a movie this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 If a score for a movie on IMDb is fixed as this is, I honestly don't think that if you showed Interferencia to 195 average people, well over 100 of them would judge it as absolutely perfect, no way on Earth. User comments are also surprisingly positive, all of IMDb users who have only commented on a movie, this. The one user (besides me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave it a bottom 1 out of 10 that looks almost right. Everyone is entitled to one's opinion, but I would focus on my life on the fact that most of the positive comments are from false accounts that are purely too big, so little cramps. Where do I start? How on earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is? The plot is a root that essentially lives or dies at its horrible twists, while most twists make a plot upside down and changes the perspective of everything that has previously been in a smart and relevant way and is true surprises here in Interferencia , the twists destroy the first half of the movie and makes it completely pointless in a 'it actually did not kind of way and twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers. What made Martin get angry? Why did he imagine the phone calls? Why did he imagine a killer? Why did he imagine the newspaper headlines? There is no explanation for Martin's behavior during the film's first hour or so, it's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his heart, and that's what it's all about the exhibition. Then there is a plot twist about Martin's wife and her lover before Martin for reasons inexplicably begins to kill his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interferencia is so bad, it's so boring, it's so poorly written and thought out, I honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it. Sorry guy, but that's how I feel, simply Interferencia is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and is a complete mess both conceptually and technically. According to IMDb, Interferencia was hot for only eight days to be honest it didn't feel that way at all. No, it feels more like it was shot in five days! The whole movie is an eye, Interferencia probably has the worst night recording I've ever seen. It's like no attempt was made to think the scenes, it's like decision makers just went into a dark room or basement or anything and just shoot the scene whether you could see something. The scenes that lie outside during the day have this horrible unnatural blue-green color to them with no apparent reason that just looks and becomes increasingly annoying. This strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes, so they are also quite crushing and noticeable. There is no real horror or scare, in fact I would say Interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror. As far as Gore goes, there are two decapitated heads in a refrigerator, a knife stuck in the mouth of the mouth and nothing else. According to IMDb, this had a budget of approx. $ 3,000, making Interferencia one of the lowest budgeted movies ever commercially released? Some people just think because a movie is low budget, all reasonable viewing standards have to go out the window and we should accept any old crap, wrong! To watch this on DVD, you still have to pay good money and I personally think we have the right to expect some kind of good product. If this can be released and praised as it is worthy of Oscar, then we can all release our camcorder footage (including embarrassing karaoke footage and scenes of total sorrow as we forgot to take off the lens cap) and win top prizes at the next Cannes film festival! The act is horrible, though the female leader Virginia Lustig is actually pretty sexy and helps ease the pain in the last 20 odds minutes when she has a fair bit. Interferencia is a horrible movie, seriously I ask you not to be fooled by all the false positive comments. There is no way who is not involved in this or has any kind of agenda to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateur mess that is really awful to sit through. Sorry, but that's how I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you've been warned!
