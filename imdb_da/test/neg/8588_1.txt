Another lame attempt to make a movie "gritty" and "thoughtful" - no matter what it means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like "television killed football." Yes what. This is another movie showing Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his styled camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz in pigs for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino are going to meet in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Since the "Scent of Woman" authors and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are no more than loudspeakers - their voices cover what would normally be superfluous and tired. He must reinvent himself and show how he can act without shouting. He has to stop getting upset with hokey scripts with cheesy lessons as "Organized Football is Shaken Up" and performing a good story.
