I go out of very few movie screenings, and this movie managed to become one of those I could not bear to watch anymore. As for the prices it won, those who are awarded by Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens Festival Prize was to believe that somehow a comedy was "translated into translation" when the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrible notions. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the screening, I presented the presenter briefly about Turkish cinema history and at one point mentioned that the early Turkish cinema was appropriately termed "scene cinema", as many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater stage. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this movie just falls into that category. English speaking reader subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally high language and attribute all that shouts in the movie to it, but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all actors perform with exaggerated high voices. You can assign this to any actor's amateur, but the biggest source of "yelled-out" dialogue is the protagonist played by the only professional actor in the movie. Not surprisingly, his background is in theater. My guess is that in response to his powerful delivery of lines, all other amateur actors also raised their voices, thus turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural notions. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this a story evolving at the snail's pace, you get an extremely boring movie. I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish movies that portrays completely rural life with low-educated characters. Ever since the "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish movies ever made, Turkish filmmakers do not seem to be able to complain about rural areas. This is only interesting in small doses and if it is so beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and control as in Zugurt Aga. Often, however, it is very boring and honestly embarrassing for native "urban" Turks. Rural areas constitute a neglected, underdeveloped part of the country, and although this provides good material for comedy, it comes at a huge price for Turkey's image. <br /> <br /> A Western audience whose only exposure to Turkey is this movie will undoubtedly believe that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and be loyal to the majority of the country living in cities shaming European metropolitan areas.
