I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen that was not an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. The reason is predictable. I couldn't make myself break any of the characters. The dialogue is cheesy. More moments in the movie have actually made me moan loudly (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke ending the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he should be from. It's supposed to be one of the least thrilling thrills I've ever seen ... ... after Sandra Bullock's character disappears, nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes. I would give this movie a negative amount of stars if I could.
