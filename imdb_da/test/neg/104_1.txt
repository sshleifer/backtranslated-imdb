This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stopped my realization that this movie really sucks! It is disguised as a "tooth film" in e.g. Memento and other jewels such, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come in to realize that this is nothing more than completely pretentious cr4p. Probably written by a collage student with friends compassionately telling him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is ?? I don't even know if it's been trying to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe it because someone fills your mind (a very weak btw) with stupid "riddles," the kind you learn in primary school, you suddenly come to "a truth" about everything, then you must kill someone and confess ??. !!! What? How, what, why, why? Is like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water ?? forgot to cook? I guess these guys forgot to explain but present the mechanism for why had this happened? You have to do that when you present a story that normal, everyday actions (lie loose riddle rhymes) begin to have an abnormal effect on humans. The action was horrible, with the girl always trying to look cute on the camera, and the guy from Highlanders, the series, appears as the big heavy metal record big (yes, they are all genuine about s-o-b's). The "threatening" atmosphere with the "oh-so-wise" puzzles (into the 60s by Batman and Robin, with The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have "knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces ?? Just awful, HORRIBLE. I am usually very partial about low-budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they might deserve, instead of their narrowing, you know, but it's just a nasty excuse for a movie that will You want to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end you will just complain that you fell for it.
