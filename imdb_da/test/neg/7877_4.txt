This is not a good movie. Simple and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, averaging (at best), plodding direction, and dull dialogue. Add in the cave and you've got mediocre plot, average acting, plodding direction, boring dialogue with lashings of hardcore porn. Trouble is also not porn anything special. So it's not a good movie, nor is it a good porn. It fails on both points. They can say that women made this movie and they intended to do it with it, and so with it, etc. But talk is cheap, the end result is what counts and what we have here is a mediocre movie with no sex thrown in for shock value to try and connect you to waste your time watching it. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it back.
