This is actually the movie that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. But if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have been very good. Long story short: extremely pronounced, slowly moving, confusing plot with choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every stroke and kick and constant "plot twists" that never end. When the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had the whole wind out of me so it really cared. <br /> <br /> See it for its historic value as a landmark of Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations to the door or you will be bitterly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
