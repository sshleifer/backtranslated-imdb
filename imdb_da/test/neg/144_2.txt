I managed it somehow to make it all through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment provided. My friends and I are fans of HK movie, but WOW. This movie has it all, and by all means I mean everything a movie shouldn't have. Under-developed and stereotypical characters, overall overactive cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfunny "gags" and "jokes", elementary school prizes, mindless kittens and also -long driving time for the material. Throw in that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie, and this movie gets even harder to wear. Simply, if you entertain the idea of ​​watching this movie ... don't.
