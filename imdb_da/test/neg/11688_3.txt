What on earth was that? My family and I spoke just 2 hours in our lives for this piece of waste !!! There was no plot, no excitement, just a lot of boredom !!! My kids could make better movies with our camcorder. <br /> <br /> But maybe we just haven't got the point with the movie ... Oh wait, my mom did it. She was the only one who liked it for the following reason: "At least a movie without cars scares ..." If you're looking for a war movie without a fight in it, it's still interesting and poignant and has a strong anti-war message, then you should see "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good enough for an afternoon snack and because I'm too good ...
