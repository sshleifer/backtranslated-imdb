Oh my God, this movie is incredible, it's the shameful movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a scary movie fan! The story is quite stupid, a group of adults decide to make a party and a stupid guy with a horrible mask comes and kills everyone ... the dialogues are kind of parody, worst, they just talk about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) discover for yourself! You really get really surprised ... (not possible! yes it is!) and the surprise movie is just 58 minutes. (not possible (yes) yes it is!) worst than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, forget it forever !!!
