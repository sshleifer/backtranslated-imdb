Jeff Leroy wanted to have fun with Scientology so built a horror movie about a cult similar to it. Twist is that, instead of weak old L. Ron Hubbard as a cult leader, there is a century-old space monster who makes his supporters vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who examines the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to cleanse his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and I'm just ugly. The space monster (which resembles a giant wing cat that looks eternally sour and has no skin) is alternately a bedtime miniature and a great animatronic doll that both look horrible. The act and writing are both horrible, and the director does not even try to pamper the fact that this film was made for nothing. Avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.
