Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. I laugh when I see American comedies, I don't laugh. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the superfluous obvious attempts to simulate high-budget US high school / pot flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot references, see Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flicks or something. Don't waste your time on this piece of film. <br /> <br /> I think how can you take those comments seriously when most people complain about the signs that don't smoke! <br /> And by the way: in Norway it is called "Dude, where is my jar"!
