It is painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is horrible and it is also the actors. They didn't want to know, even though it hit them in the face, which I felt like doing while I looked at this total pile of waste. The movie is stupid and has no humor in what ever. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. For me, it's amazing that a movie can fail so much. Not a single smart or fun line. No trace of intelligence behind it. It's a pathetic movie, and I'd like to meet the person who actually likes this movie. Yuck!
