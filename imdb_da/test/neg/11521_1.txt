Poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. Special effects are cheap. Best performance is by Yvette Napir, but that doesn't say much. History is a confusing mess of corporate greed, leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to save the stranded aboard. <br /> <br /> There is little excitement and even less action. There is a car hunt, it's not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time.
