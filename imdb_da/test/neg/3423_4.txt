Macbeth is one of the most talked about stories in the cinema and has been translated many times into several theater and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of fraud among royalty and a man's attempted power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) is trying his hand at updating Macbeth by putting it in the modern Melbourne underworld. Macbeth (Sam Worthington) is working for a movie where the characters replace swords for weapons (ala Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for mobsters. Macbeth is a greedy, violent but critically flawed movie. King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being raised to Thane of Glamis by The King (who was prophesied to Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth starts to put his eyes on the throne. One night, the king will stay in Macbeth's house, and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) speaks to him of killing the King to take power. Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. But success has the drawback that Macbeth quickly finds out when he has to go to horrible lengths to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> First, first thing. The movie's big mistake is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word ... boring. I honestly didn't care about Macbeth while I watched the movie. I had more sympathy with Victoria Hills Lady Macbeth because she was bothered to act at least. Worthington sits down to the whole movie. I felt he made his best impression of Johnny Deep's George Jung character from Blow ... but without the charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie before, so I'm not sure if it was his or her director's fault, but on the one hand, the glue that should have tied everything together into a cohesive unit must be weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but when matched to Geoffrey Wright's Australian gangster motif, it seems a little out of place. Fretically stimulated action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings create pacing conflict within the movie. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But quick action scenes after a three minute solo silo tend to be annoying, if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> Camera work is very stylized, and mostly works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera would slowly push back and forth almost constantly. I don't mind shots, that's just overdone. It goes past the kingdom to be cool and stylish and instead becomes annoying. Apart from that, the art direction and the cinematography are quite well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Shakespearian dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (the weird sisters) and good helper of brutal bloody violence. All these forces are forgotten when considering Sam Worthington's uninspired portrayal of Macbeth. Macbeth's role was essential to tie everything together, and in this respect, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable foray in Shakespeare.
