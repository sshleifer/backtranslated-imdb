That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need more reminders of US occupation with the Greed War? The subject has become so politically charged that many viewers will not only be entertained by films of this kind, but will react with barely hidden rage. It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic note on corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and smashing it into a thousand pieces. What is really annoying with these kinds of movies, including "Purpose"? is their feeling that behind the glitter there is a meaningful message that makes the movie worthwhile. In "Purpose" I did not find such a meaningful message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseating in their glibness, do very little real work. Instead, they play golf, they stretch their cool, they are "hip" with dialogue straight out of the MTV culture speech: "rock my world" and "Get back to the party, it's an order". John is lean, self-sufficient, low and smiles a lot. Robert, wearing funky little glasses, is even worse. The film features two youthful garage geeks that look as if they are straight out of the movie "Antitrust" (2001). Stereotypes are played for all they are worth, and in this movie there are also smart computer equipment and Barbie doll chickens available for the cases where our future billionaires need a bit of relaxation after all the hard party. And with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story requires, can you imagine how dated this movie will be in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> The best thing I can do for this cinematic celluloid waste is that it has some fine San Francisco aerial photos. The movie would have been much more entertaining, much more entertaining if they had killed the evil characters and the repulsive story and simply flew us into the small plane of the movie.
