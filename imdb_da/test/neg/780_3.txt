Strangely, I have very little to say about "The Box", so it gets pretty short. I have never read Richard Matheson's short story "Button, Button", of which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation", there could not have been a large part of the work of the legendary author. "The Box" is about a family who discovers a strange contraption on their door that has a button on it. Frank Langella shows and explains how they get a million dollars if they press the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? They push it ?? END OF SPOILERS ?? The whole concept was interesting alone, but somehow they managed to extend the movie to a somewhat dilapidated Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty deep message. While I am trying to be as 'fair' as possible, I still have to say that this was not my cup of tea and I was seriously bored. I guess it from the same director as "Donnie Darko", which I remember to like when I saw it many years ago. "The Box" would have worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifelessly adapted in this way, I can't get close to recommending it ...
