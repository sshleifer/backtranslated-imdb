I watched the movie many times and every time I get more and more disappointed, which is shame because the films from EX YU are usually very good. Shame here is that Holiwood tried to make movies about the place and people it didn't have any idea about. My self coming from the Balkans (Macedonia) found this movie disappointing. Only the Bosnian characters are not really understood and not really portrayed. To understand a person's mentality from EX YU you need to know their background, lifestyle, what makes them cry and laugh. And the film director did not take it as a guideline. When we (EX YU) make movies, many symbols have been built into it, making the characters recognizable and sympathetic and mostly depicting the truth (if it is based on true history). The films as "Pritty village, pretty flame" "Tito and Me", "Underground", "No man's land", "Before the Rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu" peva "(Who sings over there?) Rarely the masterpiece in Balkan cinematography, and nothing compares to it. Not the half-baked history of the Holiwood study. As someone from the panel mentions the story, jumping from one end of town to others without any real connection. sorry, but when the movie is made, it is not just for the American armchair, there are different viewers, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them also live in the Balkans and Sarajevo, and to add insult to The damage is half of the things shot in Bitola, Macedonia, where I come from. Image my shock when I saw the wide piece of Bitola in the open scene of the movie when the bride shoots from the sniper, and what was it to insert real footage of the news cover in the movie, yet very disappointing as the truth is long Don't Get Away from the Movie Shame that no one consulted the real people, how to stay in Sarajevo under fire before shooting the movie. Book is one thing, and real life is different, and this movie lets both down.
