I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment I was considering watching this movie and making other plans instead. I saw a free screening of Thunder Sound so I can't complain about the price, but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded. The action was mediocre, and the special effects were regrettable. People shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the prehistoric creatures look so good or better than those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only saving grace of the movie. I've noticed that women under the age of 18 rated the movie the highest, and the only explanation is that they run over Burns all the time. For a long time 103 minutes. This movie should have been over in about 80 minutes. It just hit on and over and over again. Don't waste your time or money on this removed flick.
