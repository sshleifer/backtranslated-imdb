This movie was so horrible, so boring, so much miscast - it took a lot of work to do what should have been a sure thing in such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball, but she was totally in this movie. Too old, couldn't sing, sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when not singing - and the biggest sin of all - she wasn't funny. EVEN A LITTLE. The studio shot itself in the foot with this, and to destroy what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous scene musical, some body parts also deserve to be hurt - or perhaps they already lacked those parts. It can explain it. But for Lucy to think she was entitled to a part that required SINGING - that is the supreme thing. Knowing your limitations is a very good thing. Even a legend cannot come out of a stink like this and still smell like a rose.
