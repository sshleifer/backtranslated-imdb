I am surprised that so many comments on this film are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels of Mika Waltari) there is no way to say very well in this movie. If I forget the origins of history, I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course, bringing such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task that should not be envied, but it can happen to the class. I can't understand why even Nefernefernefer's name had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov when Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably have made a better Sinuhe, but the overall attitude is for Hollywood to make the book right. Remember that Mika Waltari left the premier of this movie in the middle of the show. It was so much he liked it.
