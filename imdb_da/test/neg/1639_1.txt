This is about one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is not the worst thing - Manos Fathers' hands have the honor. <br /> <br /> This movie has many problems. Initially, this whole movie is a cheap rip-off of the Conan movies. There is the child in a skimpy dress wearing a hubcap, the silent Asian warrior, the cookie cutter, the bad guy, the almost thoughtless soliders and so on. There are many continuity errors in this movie. Some of the stupid mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. The Joel and the 'Bots' make the film visible, otherwise I would probably have turned five minutes into the movie.
