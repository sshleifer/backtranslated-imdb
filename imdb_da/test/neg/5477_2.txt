This should have been a moody, gritty movie that lingered in memory as an exhibition of relationships where the dominant personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of change. The action was intense and proficient, the dialogue worked, but the film was annoyingly ineffective: too many distance images suggesting a lack of focus rather than a wider picture. Poor flow. The first 5 minutes could have been missed completely. <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie with another editing might have been convincing. <br /> <br /> In its present form, it is flat, formless and hugely disappointing.
