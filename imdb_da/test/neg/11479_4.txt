I love comedies, and I love independent movies, but it was too slow, and humor was extremely regional. I think it would have been better if the protagonists were sympathetic, but they were just typical gen-x slacker types, like the people who have caused problems in high school for forty years ... I can understand high praise for a young indie filmmaker when it is deserved, but it is an extremely average movie.
