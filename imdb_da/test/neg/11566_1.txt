In fact, it was terrible. Of course, the main chicken in the person who becomes topless slept with the director at that time. It was shot in a warehouse that is probably owned by family or friends. Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. Sure there are ways to reduce costs, but are the wise ways to keep costs down? No, they are not. At least they could have found a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. These children may have at least had a lesson on history structure. At least they could have read up on 3 shopping structures, but of course that wasn't a priority either. Seeing these jerk's run around in funny clothes, stupid by 1980's standards, was an embarrassing sensation. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humility is yet another proof of the limited distribution that this film received. Had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work, there would have been a number of people waiting to jump out of the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 10/10 stars, but it was merely worth 1 to be released at all. This movie should be shown to film students everywhere. It's better than 90% of the students' movies I've seen, and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit.
