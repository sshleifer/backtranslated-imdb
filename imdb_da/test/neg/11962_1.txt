I knew I was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice flooded the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like Scare Crew). And certainly 90 minutes later, having looked beyond the scary play, boring drama, the scarecrow's blows are not close to their goals, but "hits" anyway, Ken Shamrock "acting" and the most stupid illogical end have seen in my life (ok, no, i take the last one back in a week). After completing it all, I was obviously crying that I couldn't just go to Lacuna a la Jim Carrey and just delete it completely from my mind. Any thoughts I might have had that Director Brian Katkin might have made an OK movie with the right circumstances that I had after seeing "Slaughter Studios" are completely gone from my mind now. <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert get topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until 22 September 2005)
