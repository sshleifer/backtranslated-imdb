First of all, let me make it clear that I love flying, and usually any movie with them is worth seeing - and I've been through some shocking. The same does not apply to this film. James Stewart is an outstanding actor, but he is wasted in this strategic Air Command commercial. The action is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop seeing this horrible nonsense about half way through. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography. The problem is, even for an aviation emergency like me, doing something out of the shocking plane (B-36 and B-47) just too much on the nerves. It's a shame that the movie was not made when B-52 appeared, as the superlatives used for the plane in this movie would have been valid. Then I could have been able to sit through it. Perhaps I lack the point in the film, which may be the anxiety that suffers from loved ones, while their loved ones are active tasks. In any case, it could have been done much better. Recommendation? Worth missing.
