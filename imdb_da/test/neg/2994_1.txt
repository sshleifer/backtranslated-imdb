I can't think of anything I repeat, something positive about this "movie"! A whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunk to a short 5 minute movie! In most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on, and it seems that only the camera was left with recording alone for the purpose of increasing the time of the movie! All you see is that someone in the background walks around or sees television without any particular topic or even speaks what ever! I just feel I have wasted 105 minutes of my family and my friend's weekend for nothing! If a movie is badly made or the scenario is not good, it is a completely different story, at least it gives you something to discuss about, but about DISTANT, I just have to call it a "movie" because it was movie recordings recorded of a camera. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, imagine a 105 min movie based on two lines! What do you want to end up with? 5% of the content and 95% of the fillers! That's exactly how "distant" was at least for us! The actors did a good job that had nothing special about them, they hardly spoke or showed any special emotions! I downloaded this movie in the comedy section of a store that was on what I read on the back of the cover. I still wonder what was fun in the other than our face after watching the movie.
