A mere opposite of the Se7 and not suitable for cleaning his shoes. The word "predictable" must have been invented for just such an occasion as this. Lambert is wood, as always (his moments of 'emotion' are ridiculous, as is his accent). The climax is not at all, as we have had so many signals, and in the end we are simply immune to meat, rotting and otherwise. All in all, a real mess.
