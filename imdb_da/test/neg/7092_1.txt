The last time I checked, the Nazis did not win the Second World War - not what you would notice. After all, the third realm was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold robotic assessment from the population, and that's pretty much what we were sitting today. But the way the orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked in a German accent through a high-pitched, they are disguised as touching expert advice and floating beneath your nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper. There is a continuous background bridge, a middle class message of self-improvement, whispered in the wind. "You Eat Too Much You Eat The Wrong Things You Drink You Smoke You Don't Get Enough Exercise You May Not Even * Be Hiding * You Will Die If You Don't Change Your Ways Your health will suffer. Do you have no self-respect?" Look at you. You sing me. I'm sorry. God hates you. Don't you get it? It's so sad what you're doing to yourself. It's just so bloody sad. "That's the mantra. And it goes without saying that the people who recite it are routinely depicted as saints. Last year, the media kneeled down to give Jamie Oliver a collective blow job over his School Dinners series, where he campaigned to get healthier food in school menus. Given the back-slapping reaction, you would be forgiven for believing that he personally would have saved 5,000 children from a slave pedophile. <br /> <br /> In any case, the series was a great success. In fact, it was only a real drawback that it could not be returned. Once you have saved each child in the country from a particular death once, you can't do it another time. The only solution is to find a new threat that brings us to Ian Wright's Unfit Kids (Wednesday, 9:00 PM, C4), a weekly release program where the former soccer player and the famous grammar figure force a lot of obese young people to take part in some extra-curricular PE. It is essentially a carbon copy of the Jamie Oliver show with more sweat and fewer shots of students mashing fresh basil with a pistle: an uplifting fable where Wrighty forms his gang of misfits in a lean, meaningful executive 'machine - Combating apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents and trying to make it a nationwide problem that will have Range Rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer holiness in between trips to the Conran store. Oh, it's not just terrible, what is it for them? Not our Josh you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and participates in lacrosse practice six hundred times a week. Bet he does, the little shit yes, it is warm to see blabby, inconvenient children who transform themselves with a bit of simple activity ... but there's something about the underlying eat-your-greens message that really sticks in my craw if you hadn't guessed. What happened to the concept SELECT, you * beep * So little jogging can increase your life expectancy - so what? It only corresponds to a few years in the nursing home - whoopee does. And, by the way, I'd rather fall dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of sneaky caste stops trying to heal each other. In episode 2, video games and the Internet are designated as villains in the war against flab: they make the children sedentary you see. Strangely enough, television that is just sedentary, and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique escape without twisting. It's fun to. <br /> <br /> Now, listen here, Channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat brackets or make squats, how to teach them to think more expansively so they reject the wobbly, soothing nature of programs like that here? Or would it be a campaign too far?
