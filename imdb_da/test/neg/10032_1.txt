I went into a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I don't want to say the name because I'm a dedicated customer. I've been happy with every thing I bought there before this one. The Bell Witch Haunting was on the display in the front of the store. (May I mention that this is the only store I've seen for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it should have really happened to be right. I was very excited and couldn't wait to see it. I had great expectations for that. I couldn't believe what I saw when I saw it. It didn't look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression that it was a horror movie. I think the movie was supposed to be a witch joking about you. This is no horror movie. You will not jump out of your seat and watch this movie. I gave the film all the chances in the world to get better when it went together. I swear I did. It never got better. There were several scenes of this little child who got poop and piss thrown at him. I didn't find it entertaining at all. I saw the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me. I think it's so bad that this economy has. I have this to say to the cast and the crew. Don't show this movie as material to get other movie jobs. Don't do it. I mean this with sincerity. I recommend you try. For people who bought this. I say this. Do not sell your copy to anyone. They could be very sad. Have a nice day everyone.
