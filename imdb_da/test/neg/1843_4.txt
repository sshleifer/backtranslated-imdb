The concept for this movie was pretty good. But somehow the performance failed in many parts. There aren't many horror movies I can think of the used dolls that looked so realistic. Especially when these dolls begin to blink their eyes or move their hands. So much could have been done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was room for excitement and excitement. And I really expected horrible things to happen. But it never managed to be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. In fact, I thought they did it on purpose to surprise us with some wonderful twists and turns. Unfortunately, it does not happen. Well at least not in the way I hoped. The cast also failed to make it all credible. It would have been nice if more backgrounds were given to the signs. In the beginning when we are introduced to the main character. It seems she and other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also clear that they do not have an idea of ​​what they are invited to. It is, of course, part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I got an invitation without a clue what the deal is, I simply wouldn't go. Moreover, most characters do not really like the final result that you never actually care for. Another mistake is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that are never explained and not even relevant to the "Doll Master mystery". Overall, this movie has been a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls, see "Dead Silence"!
