The lousiest of all the miserable Jaw's rip-offs was unfortunately made by one of my all-time favorite directors; Lamberto Bava (here under his John Old Jr. pseudonym). You know how it goes in these cheap European imitations, right? They only want their monstrous animals to be bigger, sick, and more threatening, but it results more than often in the opposite effect. Bava's creature is a humongous seawater, and it's more than just a shark! We are apparently dealing with a prehistoric monster here with cakes and appetites for a big white, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It is up to a few dolphin-loving oceanologists to discover how this monster was able to survive all those thousands of years, and why he just started his killed spree now. The script for "Monster Shark" makes little sense, and most of the action takes place on the mainland. The shark itself is an unintentional ridiculous creation, and it was a wise decision by Lamberto Bava to show it only vaguely and quickly. The performances are above average, and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well-managed. The twists in the plot are predictable, and you will probably have the most fun to spot detailed facts about the characters. For example: count all the boxes of beer Dr. Hogan drinks the whole movie!
