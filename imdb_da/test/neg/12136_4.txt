Can anyone help me miss the last point of view and I won't pay money to watch the whole movie again. I just need where they are in the train wagon and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiling. what happens after that? is there longer dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? I was a little bored in the movie and kept hoping it would be better. I love Kristen Scott Thomas remembers any British television series she was in about some nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was brilliant Madonna eats your heart! Everyone else actually made the movie a little predictable, it was a 'place a star cast'. The end surprised me, I really thought she'd burned her boats ..... if you're a fan of any of the stars, it's worth seeing.
