Based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name, Killshot suffers from lack of focus, direction, and creativity? All the elements that the original story probably had, and negative test screenings forced severe edits (including complete carving of a character) result in a movie that hardly feels like a Leonard story. Too many characters populate a story of simplistic and straightforward (not a typical feature of the author's work), and the focus continually shifts between two hit men who are hard to like and a restless couple who do not order our sympathy. While history itself provides precious few phrases, unfortunately at the end of the film its appeal remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> Washed-up hit-man Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions, which unintentionally gives his latest job. Now, fleeing from his former employer, he coincides randomly with the creepy misfit criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to get some quick cash by extorting a wealthy real estate agent. When she fights, couples Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are privileged over the thieves' blundered plot, they are forced to hide, as the crazy killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot shows that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel is not the basis for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations and even resolutions in the movie are all tired and unoriginal and only very random hints on something more. It is not that there was no potential, especially when Rourke's black-twisted, calm and collected assassins execute a hit during the opening scene? Purposes and protagonists are only given up as every minute fleets away. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most exciting; Visually, Birds and Even Wayne's roles fall out appropriately and provide immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative death. Pairing the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is an alluring combination (comparisons with Fargo would be extravagant for friendly), except that each character slowly loses the traits that kept them interesting. When Richie begins to retrieve the more experienced killer's habits, Bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. Whatever he sees in his immediate noisy joy with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky Carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness, which drastically affects his outcome. Probably or not, this is Killshot's unfortunate downfall ?? and a little entertainment can be obtained from these characters, who constantly lose their originality by constantly contradicting the habits that once made them exciting. <br /> <br /> - The Massie Twins
