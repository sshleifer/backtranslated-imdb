This film is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie outside the gates at any cost. Only with this movie is it really a near miss. Everything looks like Robocop 2 is a worthy follow-up to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (except for the deaths, of course) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent instructor, as good as neutralizing their efforts. Irvin Kershner could have been the ideal guy for George Lucas to lead Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner, there is not much to destroy in Lucas' charming movie series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have meant that either Paul Verhoeven should return, or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it. Kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for it) and he's probably no Verhoeven. So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the movements to replicate the first movie, but with no freshness, humor or boldness the original had. Kershner probably thought he could top Verhoeven by adding more fun and free violence, but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a rental director instead of a passionate movie maker. And it's a shame as everything was in place to make this second classic. As mentioned, the actors give it their best, but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects, and there are some good ideas in the story of Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through.
