Piranha starts as expected, stupid white people will discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it could be a cannibal movie. It starts like so many others that show nothing but shots from pristine Amazon rainforest. For all I know, it could be Florida. At this point, you find that some animals' mutilation or natives will appear. Instead, you get William Smith's acting talents that played at L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, a recognized hunter, whom I would describe him as Jack Palance Light. He's bigger in stature, but not quite Jack Palance's goodness. As for natives, you do not get so many. Where's the piranha? Should I even ask that question? Caribe is now chasing people, I think. He doesn't really pursue anyone until the end of the movie though, just staring at them. Caribe runs one of the tourists on a motorcycle in an over-dramatic Smokey and Bandit kind of way. The motorcycle challenge happens without any real reason other than an action sequence. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never actually. Do they live, do they die? Do you want to take care? Someone wants to ride on motorcycles? Caution: This film contains extremely dry appearance. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
