Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this movie. If it was to make my good day feel like a night of disturbing memories than I suppose, he succeeded. <br /> <br /> I know there were big questions in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a god. All big questions, but I really don't think it's fun when you have the questions along the side of such a tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed, but coming again. It is never fun when a wife is raped, someone kills herself (and family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons. The only good thing about this movie was the location was filmed. There are many beautiful places. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film student or know everything about the subject, I admit this, but I know when I leave the theater with a sense of disgust, then it wasn't a movie I would recommend to anyone.
