(This can have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and the bizarre dream sequence I was willing to forgive, but the lack of appearance in the main character and all the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in seeing the rest of this movie. (I know, in vain.) The music at first was tense and appropriate I thought of a fantasy gothic novel. But come on! Saxophone music for an early 1900s movie? It doesn't quite fit. This movie was totally boring and if you are looking to watch a good movie or an east you cannot rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a failing class!
