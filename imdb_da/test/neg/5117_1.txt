What can you say about a movie that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like "The English Patient." Again, the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP." <br /> <br /> Four buxom sorority sisters and a blunt male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench, and the women become sexually charged. The mere wench leaves porn devices and a blow up doll, just like in "TEWP." They are lost, doofus is lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There, the end of "The Blair Witch Project" resumes which cameras are dropped, and the wizard is seen playing hopscotch, a game integrated into the thin plot. At least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of indentations and line marks along with the rather obvious surgical scars. The one "natural" gal here is humiliated by the director. In a very unfunny and overlong end-credit segment, played out scenes where she could not get a line to the right, played over and over again at nauseum. Julie Strain appears in a screaming wig to play the bare wench. This scene seems to be added later, as no one might be credited with throwing it. In the background, like the women cavort and stroke, you can see a person's picket fence. This can be the director Jim Wynorski's backyard. <br /> <br /> These are just bad things. The lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than "The Erotic Witch Project's. Most of lovin 'consists of the four women who mashing their eight collective breasts together. I think they are trying to form a silicone-based way of life that would save them from this bad career decision, no such luck, if imitation is the sincere kind of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" should really be angry. <br /> <br /> This is not classified and contains mild physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
