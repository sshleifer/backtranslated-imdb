If you can stomach the camp, this movie must make you laugh a lot several times. It did for me, at least. I will only mention one of my favorite elements: "The underwater images" of the "fish" "swimming". The sound that comes with these shots is also great. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; seeing him as "The Greatest American Hero" was a fun part of my childhood a few decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since. He seemed a little depressed in this movie. Someone gives him a fun job on a good show or something.
