this is a movie that reminds me of avatar starring rajesh khanna from the 80s. The issue of parents and children dividing is interesting, but was handled in a rather unoriginal way. The characters were not fully developed and the children seemed to go from being extremely affectionate (in the first 15mts of the movie) to being completely unconcerned about parents, this transformation was not credible to say the least .. they have explored this a little more. amitabh and jaya were mistaken for this helpless old couple. Firstly, the amit was not too convincing in this role because he just didn't look like he should be helpless, I mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w / kids who didn't want them .. hema was not convincing as a 60 year old either ... she did not look a day over 50 .. so the whole ice sue of the book baghban wins the booker prize bad credibility .. all in all, a movie that handles an important problem but cld has improved, I give it 5/10
