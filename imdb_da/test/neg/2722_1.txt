I'm stunned and horrified by the positive reviews this movie receives. Not only is it hokey, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also shamelessly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr. 'is paraded around like a cute little thing animal, like a puppy that is so sweet you just want to take him home. This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human, but as a manipulative entity to draw sympathy from its audience. Even more horrible are the many moments of the movie, where Radio is hit in the head / tours / falls over / etc. These moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter, just because "it's fun because radio is retarded." It's shameless. Now, I do not feel that the word "retard" is an appropriate word for anyone to describe the mentally handicapped, but this seems to be the attitude the movie takes, "Radio is retarded, but it is okay because he is cute and we can like him." Gooding's depiction seems better suited to a John Waters movie than an inspirational family drama. To add disgrace to the movie is incompetent at all levels, Debra Winger is uninspired in the role of the "stereotypical housewives" as the very reminder of her scary monologues of laughter in everybody watching the movie. The result of John Horner is pure juice, which always overlaps its tear a score over the tired filmography. Ed Harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to keep many of the audience's attention throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent person, you ignore this travesty of a movie, read the book, but otherwise, this grim movie jumps on an interesting sign of American history.
