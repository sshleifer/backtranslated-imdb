Okay,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him / her, but think a little less. This is a brutal movie showing many men's genitals. It is a spear in the 1970s with black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. The only fun part about it for me is that all voices have been looped with drachmas, even the right women's voices. This is over a top, nonstop, laughing at your rear end is that stupid, badly made movie. I would never see it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no assessment on this, but it would be R or NC-17. RuPaul has done much better work.
