It is true, nobody really expects anything from successors. But even at the low standard, it's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> A fourth part of the Hellraiser saga is essentially an anthology film that attempts to be a story of origin and a wind-up for the whole series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the players have had enough time to do anything with their characters, and the rookie director Yagher left the film instead of giving in to studying. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you are an "Alan Smithee" fan, avoid this one.
