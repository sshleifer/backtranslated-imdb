Not only did the effects work and work in this movie bit, but the story was horrible. A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then everyone is worried that he "plays God". <br /> <br /> How paralyzing! He built the case, why are all "eligible" for access? Absolutely amazing story, don't play your time!
