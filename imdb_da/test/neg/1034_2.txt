Some ugly weirdo who had three families cheated on and neglected all of them, built ugly, useless buildings everywhere that are now unworthy and crumbled. His bastard half-Jewish son runs around interviewing random Jewish senile people whom we don't care about and shows his terrible narrative and writing skills while tragic piano music plays. This continues for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing. All you shallow hippie people who look at these silly documentaries, eat salads and yogurt, seems all this is so important. It is not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
