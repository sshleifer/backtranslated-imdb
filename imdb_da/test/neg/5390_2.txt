Most of the other posts struck this movie and deserved it. I just have to chime on the technical uncertainty of movie makers. It would have been good if the director had at least lunch with someone who knew what a gun was because he had no clue. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU ARE WARNED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> Spec Ops team gathered from various military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Perhaps two people in the unit had weapons using the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. The sniper's instructor uses a sub-gun caliper (gun caliber) as opposed to a rifle that we would assume would be more proficient. <br /> <br /> A bad team member's night vision optics weighs more than the gun does. You can tell when he handles it that it is seriously high. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" Skeleton Man when they first confront him. Challenge a 200-year-old revived Indian skeleton with a long spear and an attitude that rides an undead war horse with a serious nosebleed? I don't think Bubba. Bullets do not spark when they hit trees, Mr Director. (A few people have already mentioned this.) The "air support" teams consist of an ubiquitous "black helicopter", only one has a few sidewinder missiles knocked down below. Someone forgot to tell the helo the skeleton man does not fly and they are over the American heartland where there will be no enemy aircraft. They should have transported some air-to-ground missiles instead. <br /> <br /> Helo's air to ground ordnance consists of a doorway with a semi-auto AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, he only hits dirt. Should have brought a belt fed light machine gun. <br /> <br /> The shooter later finds out that a grenade trigger is also quite useless. <br /> <br /> A woodpile from a freaking recurve bow does not make down helicopters, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> I couldn't go further after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick, it's just so painful.
