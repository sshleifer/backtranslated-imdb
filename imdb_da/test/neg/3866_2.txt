The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS, is a movie that looks good while it plays, but fails to engage the viewer. Dietrich's plodding story, which is torn between two men, becomes a mammoth cabaret star, and fights for her child's custody, is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. Dietrich unknowingly turns into a rather passive, reactive role for much of the movie, and her character remains independent of viewers, while Herbert Marshal is unconvincing as his bad man, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. The movie features some exciting sets of pieces (the "Hot Voodoo" song is the highlight) that is impressively surreal for this Hollywood era, although it does not prove useful in such a dull, incoherent film.
