After almost being killed by a large dog, a swelling cat thinks to himself: "Why can't I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone." She looks around at dusk and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some glue burger cheese and some garlic ...... hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the forerunner of "Pepe Le Pew", although in this cartoon she is still a cat, she is a she and just a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> The cat also enjoys and exploits its new status as a smelly skunk. He's a happy, happy guy now ..... until a real skunk (with Charles Boyer's imitation voice) shows up! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the cat in a Bugs Bunny outfit. However, I never succumbed to these French takeoff signs, finding the stereotype dialogue exaggerated and not really fun, so I only judge this as "fair". However, I make this a point of morality at the end of history.
