I have read all Dave Robicheaux novels and are considering James Lee Burke to be my favorite modern fiction writer. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I strongly expected to see "In the electric fog", especially when I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interaction with the "ghosts of the Confederate dead" was low and lost the effect and the nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was tireless, expressive and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable movie is to add my "dito" to a previous user comment that this movie was like one of the old movie films. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell would show up at any time. <br /> <br /> The location settings were correct, and the shooting sometimes captured the essence of steaming bayous, smoky juke joints and spooky earthy cemeteries in South Louisiana. It's too bad that history's uneven presentation and Tommy Lee's sub-par performance interfered with the area's unique mood and spicy edge. <br /> <br /> In addition to the final comment: Dave Robicheaux's nickname "Streak" is due to the distinctive silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to how Sopranos Paulie Walnuts would look if he was only seen in profile.) Tommy Lee did not have such a touch in this movie, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed out after seeing Jones Jones poorly imitation of Dave Robicheaux. Final Comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and uncomfortable in most roles, he was far better off a Robicheaux in "Heaven's Fangers" than Tommy Lee was in "In the Electric Fog." Heavenly Prisoners are also much more interesting and exciting, with consistently credible performances and more evocative surroundings than this new movie. <br /> <br /> "In Electric Mist" is okay to see when you feel "veging out" and there is nothing better on TV. But then there are also infomercials.
