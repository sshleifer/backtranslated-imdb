Spoofgenren, who for many years lacked creativity and humor, is spit on yet again by hacks without talent. No point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It takes more than just referring to some newer films and signifying double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. Any clod can download a cam-corder and have some bad-acting friends in cheap costumes imitating someone. Since the genre is targeted this time is inspirational sports film, there are few lame references thrown into films of this type: the jokes are so weak that the characters actually need to emphasize the references in different ways to make you laugh hysterically. It does not work. <br /> <br /> It's not comedy. However, the same old worn sophomoric "jokes" are skinned out of a middle school washroom (made even more mixed than usual) all here. If that is not enough, there is an ongoing "gag" of a bus that drives someone over. So funny, right? A pathetic bad scene also makes more product placement than Michael Bay; Again with the same unfunny results. A musical bit flops miserably. Too bad Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now stuck with roles in swell like this. <br /> <br /> Lousy outside words. Seeing a snail run marathon would be less boring than watching this movie. Probably also much more fun.
