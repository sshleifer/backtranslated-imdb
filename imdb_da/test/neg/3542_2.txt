This is terrible even for a TV movie. I can't believe it took three people to write this movie. I'm not familiar with the novel on which this movie was based, but it must be better than this. I'd rather see a "Full House" marathon than this silly movie. I gave it only 2 out of 10 stars because it was made better by advertising.
