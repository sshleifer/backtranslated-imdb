Carmen is a prostitute who lives seductively and steals soldiers from the Spanish army; She is undoubtedly the best femme fatal at the moment. When a man resists her charming attention, she decides to do everything possible to destroy him. Eventually he falls into his web, and he will be forced to do all the things he ever hated just to be with Carmen. Despite the fact that Paz Vega is very beautiful, she does not look like a gypsy (as Carmen is) and neither her actor nor Sbaraglia are good. The story results very boring, and in most moments it is very absurd, while it will prove truthful. Similarly, the scenarios and the special effects are, despite not being, but they are not but acceptable and too much artificial to a historical movie as it is. In summary, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are much better things to look at.
