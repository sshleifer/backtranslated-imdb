The IMDB plot collection certainly makes it happy that it is Noah Taylor's movie when Fairuza Balk is the key character. It's amazing how such a cast of incumbents could have been in such an amateurish, meaningless, non-film. Balk breaks up with girlfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - played by Dempsey), and accidentally kills Taylor - who follows her for the rest of the movie as a ghost. May be the worst movie I've ever seen.
