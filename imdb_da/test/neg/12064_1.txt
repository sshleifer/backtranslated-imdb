I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially of Scream 1-3, but one is just a killer after another. To my astonishment: Part II is much better and you get the whole story of Part 1 summarized! So don't play time on this and move on to part II, you won't regret it because part 2 actually has a PLOT and is completely self-leveling. First part: 1 out of 10 Second part: 4 out of 10
