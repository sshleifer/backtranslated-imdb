I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box I would sell for $ 2 in a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the protagonist coming back from the success of the previous movie to destroy everything with this burden of waste. Why would decision makers destroy the reputation of the last 2 movies with this cheap junk. The story is so lame that had to be a scandalous successor. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this movie and the Cobra were bent on showing the hero shooting his arms on the hip plane and the enemy fell into great numbers. Police officers spend hours on the shooting range, why were they so hit by gang leaders shooting around their hips? This movie was so bad I thought for a moment it was Death Wish 4.
