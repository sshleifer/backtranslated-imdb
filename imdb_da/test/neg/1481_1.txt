A dustbin classic! Basically what we have here is a story of a few American teenagers (a man, a woman, both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychologically connected, each time they both fall asleep, they can inhabit each other's dreams and express each other's interiors. wish ... think Mills & Boon will meet with X files and you will be somewhere near the mark. In fact, it is more like an unhappy hybrid between one of Ed Wood's infamous bad B-movies and a particularly stupid episode of Melrose Place, so sticky are the special effects, and so amateurish is the actor. The actors who reside (I do not want to act) say they say that they read from cue cards and pout to show a feeling and it comes as no big shock (or loss) for the industry), which they have since faded into ambiguity. It's just a ridiculously misunderstood mix of styles that don't even go together, and the end result is an exciting curiosity that will undoubtedly be charged by purveyors of so bad-they are great movies this year to come. I would probably be the only person to ever comment on this movie, but if you read and have seen it, you came back, it gets a little lonely here around ...
