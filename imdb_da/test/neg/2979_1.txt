This feels like a prolonged treatment of a comedy routine that could also have been told about a ten minute card. Technical credits are also supported. The film really feels like a film school exam project. <br /> <br /> Cast is a mix of experienced stage profiles and skilled newcomers, but the problems are superficial scripts. Their lines feel constructed just like cued TV show material. <br /> <br /> The director fails to take his main characters seriously, so we are not touched by their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film has been wisely marketed and offers a unique selling point, but ultimately disappoint the film at all levels.
