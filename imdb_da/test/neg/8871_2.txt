Tu pa tam is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand, it is better than most films from Slovenia that are filled with depressing characters and history without any bright ideas. Tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without artistic moments. In many interviews, Mitja Okorn's director tried to tell us that his film is of high quality just because it didn't cost much money. But thinking that way is wrong. Tu pa tam is for me very bad film. The dialogues are really badly written (90% of the script is curse), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its phrases are very predictable, and the action sequences (this movie is supposed to be an action comedy) are filmed very very badly and without any style. Okorn just thinks he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he copies his style over 90 minutes. The mood of the film is very cheap and primitive (Okorn believes that constant curse is fun). In my opinion Tu is very cheap (not just budget) movies with stupid history and very bad acting.
