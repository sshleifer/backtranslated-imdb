This DVD lacks its calling as Heineken coaster .... This is a good example of why no one should ever see a successor with another director / author other than the original. Two hours of this turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 reruns. <br /> <br /> NO legitimate laughs. Not a decent scare. The script was just a mess, and I felt bad for the actors who had to do it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke or something). Original was a makeup effects landmark. So, of course, the successors of the successor believed that it would be a good idea to scrap the makeup FX and make CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves made me laugh much harder than any of the "comedies". It was just a total miss. If you want a night's entertainment, rent the original again. Or go take a movie class and make your own horror movie. You are bound to do better than these fools did.
