An inexpensive cheap police thriller, sustained by some fair humorous pieces, the fine chemistry between the two leaders and especially James Remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and naturally indestructible) villain. Of course, a picture quality picture, both visually and dramatically, with a rather dismissed Burt, but not unmatched. (**)
