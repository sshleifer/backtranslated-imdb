It's terrible! It's as if someone gave a child a defective camcorder and $ 30 and told them to make a movie. Even then you will get a better and more professional movie than this. The story is so stupid you can say that there is not one. I don't think the guy who did this knew what to do at all - seeing foreign art films all day long is not enough to make anyone an immediate instructor. The action is very poor, really kindergarten level and the writing is simply horrible. The only scene I didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident, but even that just meant it was just a little less terrible than the rest of the movie. How do people get funding for these things? I don't mind alternative movies, but should they at least not be a big steaming pile of livestock manure? I would call "Price of Milk" amateurish, if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. This would not even be a good movie if you were full or skilled!
