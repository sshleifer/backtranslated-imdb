A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budgets out to do something wise and original - and although there is a bit of originality and some skillful drawings in this slack puppet show, take "Dante's Inferno", there's nothing particularly wise. Dante's "divine comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vagual moralistic student movie with pretensions to High Art. I suppose those who loved this movie were the easily amused by sophomoric pokes on some icons of political and / or religious law, and that those who hated it violated to see their favored icons come across. As much as possible, and few of these pokes actually rose to the level of satire. <br /> <br /> The movie's highest point is a sudden outbreak of "Schoolhouse Rock" on the subject of lobbying and "revolving door." It's really a shame that the whole movie couldn't have been a musical. It would have removed a great deal of the annoying film school's pretentiousness and added a much stronger element of fun.
