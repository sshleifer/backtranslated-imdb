Being an admitted chess abuser, I was thrilled to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see a profound look at the fight and much of what Kasparov had to say. Boy was I wrong and misunderstood by a mile. This documentary film looks like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash, but no real substance. After seeing it, I'm sorry to say I felt I was wasting my time. One of the most annoying aspects of the documentary is that it does not stay in one place for a decent period. It has the typical MTV type editing, where the camera displays different images and quick sound bits from people every five seconds. It is very sad that film production has been emigrated to a 10-year-old child's attention. <br /> <br /> I understand it's hard to make a movie about chess, but that doesn't mean one should make it flashy. However, 'Game Over' had some interesting ideas. It took up the idea of ​​whether or not computers can think like humans; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. That's how Kasparov thought after the fight, but this film doesn't go deep enough with this idea. This film also tries to bring a bizarre theory. It tries to assume the paranoid that a human being did the movements with the help of the computer. Kasparov suspected this, but still to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film, it tries to mean the bizarre that perhaps Anatoly Karpov might have been the man who secretly made the movements using Deep Blue. Interesting to think about, but I don't know how plausible or realistic it is. I still wouldn't recommend this movie myself, not even for chess abusers.
