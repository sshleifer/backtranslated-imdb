I saw this movie without knowing much about it at all. The split screen device was immediately annoying and things didn't improve me after the title sequence was finished. The plot, the characters and the dialogue were all extremely clich√© - poor guy from battered family being thrown out of the home, wanting to get out of his 'lot', reviving himself, changing his voice, dressing in other people's clothes, being adopted by gay man as he continues to forget on the way to becoming part of an international set of drugs taking British aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The property of Patricia Highsmith (talented Mr. Ripley) should sue the filmmakers. The triple screen for me, along with over 120 min. Duration, it underlines almost non-existent editing. Can't decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them. This gimmick removed any connection or interest I had with any of the characters. The important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen, as saying "this is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!". Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
