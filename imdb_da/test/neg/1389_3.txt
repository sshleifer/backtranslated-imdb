I am surprised that the comparison has not yet happened between Mind of Mencia and the TV program The Awful Truth, which ran some years ago. Hell of controversial director Michael Moore, the show will begin, in the same gentleman as this show, with Moore interacting with the audience and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and sketches that had been put together to provoke thoughts of current problems. The difference? Mencia rarely goes beyond superficial and reactionary. What he says and does is often pandering and rude and insulting his audience's ability to make decisions for themselves. There is a difference between being "edgy", which I have no problem with, but Mencia is trying too hard to achieve this and ends up coming out as arrogant and with little support. He does, however, sometimes do, but often to come to them, one must sit through a beautifully mindless attempt at shock humor.
