What is a crap movie. The script is simply non-existent. The movie sometimes seems like a music video. But it can't even be because the soundtrack doesn't really fit. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. You might think it is a recipe for a successful flick ... here it sinks immensely. Dialogues in this flick turned me straight. The scene where Harlan is interrogated by a policeman is just pitiful. In general, newer Seagals movies are hardly aware. What the hell happened to the guy? I know he's old, but can't he get "Hollywood" to release him a decent script or something? Does he run out of dough for his escapades into India, that he takes on everything they serve him?
