Nothing special to see here, the animation is outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This movie has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original plot or character, then I don't think it's worth seeing. I'm not saying the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story, and I thought I saw this movie as a thousand times. So if you're looking for something original, look for another thing.
