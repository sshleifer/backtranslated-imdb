Subspecies are set in Romania, where two American students Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) will study local folklore using local friend Mara (Irina Movila). They rent rooms in a hotel and get curious about the mysterious ruins of the nearby slots. It turns out that a strong and evil vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there who has stolen Bloodstone from his father, King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). Radu wants the three girls and starts drinking the blood of Mara & Lillian, while Michele falls for a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson) who just happens to be Radu's brother. Michele & Stefan decide to build and eliminate the world with the evil Radu ... Directed by Ted Nicolaou, this movie seems to be quite well-recognized among genre fans & while it is not terrible, I would certainly not call it very good & I really couldn't see much to get excited about. Subspecies are a rather slow movie, not so much actually happening, and while trying to stay close to some classic Vampire Lore, there is all this nonsense about a Bloodstone & some small monsters growing from the tips of Radu's separate fingers of a for some reason. Subspecies could have been a half decent movie, if not for the fact that it's boring, I really can't remember so much about it, good or bad. The character is okay, but some are the dialogue stupid and there is a scene that bugged me near the start, as the girls are at the castle ruins and you say that they have to go because it gets dark, but it is still clear in the middle of the day & much bright. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin as the hotel's attic and doesn't really seem to be bothered by it. I'm not funny but are a little if the house I lived in had a coffin in the ceiling be very worried if you know what I mean. I don't think I will ever see it again, there is no real threat, the plot is weak, mixing classic vampire themes with stupid subplots, and I was clearly untouched by it all. Not the worst movie ever, but almost not the best movie either. The movie looks great with nice places and some local scenery, even if you feel the look is down in the budget rather than the decision makers trying a authenticity. There is not much gore except for an assault and some broken finger tips. No apparent cause casts the decision makers some transparent stop-motion animated monsters that really do nothing or are of great importance to history. Filmed on the cheap by Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment production company in Bucharest in Romania, the production values ​​are okay and better than many later tape productions. The play is not good with many of the casts that sit down during couple recordings, while the genre regular Angus Scrimm has a small cameo in the beginning. There is a little bit of style here for occasional occasions with a few scenes reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially the piece that shows Radu's shadow coming down the stairs with his long claw as nail products stand out. <br /> <br /> Subspecies are a movie that many seem to suffer for reasons that I don't quite see, I thought it was average at best, generally, boring. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) and Spinoff Film Vampire Journal (1997).
