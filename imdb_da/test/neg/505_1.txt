Now infamous Western it was (in its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was "lucky" enough to watch the full 220 minute version at a theater in 1990. It was really scary how the BAD movie was! <br /> <br /> They had a great cast, a story based on a true event (a battle between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), magnificent scenery ... so what went wrong? Three words - Director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" he went out and made this God horrible western. He is not completely guilty. His former film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece, and United Artists gave him free reign to do everything. They let him be all alone ... and everything went wrong. The cost went out of control and Cimino insisted on restoring sequences over and over until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First, the sound is horrible. Whole sequences go by and you can't make a word the characters say. For example, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but I still have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his initial scene is incomprehensible! It is the director's fault - he should have ensured that the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around that you almost can't figure out what's going on. The storyline doesn't make much sense, and Cimino took great liberty with the facts - in the real story, only one person was killed - Cimino makes it a massacre. There are some beautiful scenes here completely destroyed by lack of history and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theater - all printed sound that way. <br /> <br /> This waste effectively closed United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself, he does not know what he is doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he has ever done. This is from a guy who made "Tron"! A certain must-miss. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good book called "The Final Cut," which describes the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers - it deserves it!
