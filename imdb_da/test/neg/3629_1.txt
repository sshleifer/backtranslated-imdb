Zeoy101 ?? This really should be one of the most stupid attempts to get people in my age group attention. It's about some preppy girls called Zeoy and her friends going to boarding school. BORING!!! Everything she ever does is whine and complain and seems like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this show came out in 2005, I was 13 out of 14, and even then I thought it was meaningless. The only episode I ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls' dorm. THAT IS IT. Anyway, I just don't understand why Nickel-Oh my bad Nick feels the need to syndicate this apologetic excuse for "entertainment". Seriously this decade becomes a joke every year and it gets worst and worst. What about this generation? Anyway, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
