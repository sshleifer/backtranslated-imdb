In short, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian horror, and I can see unoriginal (I even enjoyed "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but it was just poor. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of very high quality elements: the photography is eye-catching, the pictures are cool, the director is inspired, the play is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears, and CGI is incredible. But as this is a horror movie, we are expected to be scared, which just won't happen with this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, this is unoriginal almost from the beginning to the end: there are trademark long-haired avenged female ghosts, vicious clumps of thick, black hair and puddles, and near the end, a twist like * almost * but not quite sensible out of it all (twisted is easily one of the best qualities). And for the viewer's irritation when the film is not reused (sometimes, so that it can be easily called plagiarism) imaging from other movies, it makes you jump. A lot. And by jumping I don't understand things that jump out or anything, just very big sounds and screams in the soundtrack used to get the audience jumping six feet in the air (there are even a few "made" jumps moments that is simply infuriating. And when it does not rip off other movies, it is boring and hard to sit through. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame because "Ryeong" could have been really good and it has everything to do is good, but it is the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud sounds and bounces that eventually destroy the movie, a perfect example of how well it could have been: There is a moment when one of the drawn looks On a corpse and without sound, the body looks back, it is quite predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant, and unfortunately it is as scary as the movie has given me. Of course, "Ryeong" has some good features and even a few jumpers that are not so predictable and do work e. There is a very good and sad back story used to explain the events and the turn is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the movie from any other Asian ghost / horror movie. But the problem with these is, even if they do work, they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize that the great revelation was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters") and that takes the back story a good fifty minutes to get started. So in the end, "Ryong" really seems like a really wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that plot twist and other good features would act as redirects, so the audience would not notice the big flaws. But he failed, and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
