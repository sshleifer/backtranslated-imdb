This documentary is trying comedy, but never comes completely to me. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The more appropriate word that everyone agrees - and has difficulty avoiding in any review - is kitsch. It dripped kitsch. It was as if the filmmakers were worried that their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and then they bent backwards to put kitsch and proclaim: "We're doing fun around here! Watch ???" <br /> In short, I felt it was trying too hard. For example, the socks that introduced each scene (for me) were annoying when I was sure they were entertaining - or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> Don't avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to bless in kitsch instead of having it printed unprepared. If you are interested in light-hearted fare, you can do far, far worse. At least, the facts about backing and leaving Bakers make this interesting and worth seeing. At best, gaggles of like-minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the movie.
