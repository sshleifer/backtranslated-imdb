However, the problem with making a movie like this is that the final, cream-de-la-cream of the film, the battle between the two soup-up ships, must be done well. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is of course completely finished with small model ships in an overgrown vessel. There are no voltages, a little explanation of what happens exactly and what the time frame is of standby. <br /> <br /> The film takes quite a few freedoms with the surrounding history, which all true stories do when converted into a movie by the Union's traitor and especially Betty Stuart (Madsen), a Virginia belle. <br /> <br /> It stands out to make a possibly decent movie involving an interesting story about the ironclads to preach about the evil of slavery. It was out of place in this historic drama, and it was a cheap move to bring women viewers. Only the positives of the film were reduced.
