I found this on the shelf and swooned with joy !! I danced up to the counter, beat my money and ran home! You know what ?! I fell asleep less than halfway through! Tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the heck !?!! I couldn't see it! I love all the other things he's done (I didn't see it with the monster in it yet). What gives? Is it me? Or him? So sad. Boo hoo. PS, I liked the camera work.
