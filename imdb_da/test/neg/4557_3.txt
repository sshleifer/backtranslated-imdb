Another stinks from the PM Entertainment group, and fortunately one of their last. <br /> <br /> 'Firetrap' is actually a very low budget remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I don't mind low budget B movies as long as any effort is put into them - there is no effort at all in 'Firetrap' is stars Dean'Superman'Cain, an absolutely horrible actor, seriously he has all the skills a porn star has, but he turns out to be the best actor here and that says something, the rest is just a bunch No aspirations are given the baggage from different daytime laps. The special FX is just a nonsense, shot showing the burning building from the ground is among the worst I have ever seen, the fire looks like someone who has written an orange pen on the front of the camera. In addition, there is not a sign you are actually present for - you hate everyone and hope they all die well within 90 minutes is up. Scripture is embarrassing - The red herring is well signposted, another has mentioned this, but 'the scene where the janitor is fighting out a flaming fire that strikes the building with its diet ... fun or the same guardian goes in in a room labeled 'dangerous material', should these scenes be tongue-in-cheek? somehow I doubt it. One good point and only one good point was that there was a fair effort among daytime drama that kept my attention, but so little care was given to everything in movies, I can't recommend it - instead of 'The Towering Inferno 'instead of <br /> <br /> 3/10
