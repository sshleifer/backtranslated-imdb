... so where's my friggin trophy? I seriously expected a banner and confetti to fall from my ceiling to see a full 30 minutes of the stupid. Comedy Central really hits the ball in the end and tries to fill the gap left by Chappelle with several seasons of a late man imitating retarded men. Dah duh nah !! If you watch the show, you will notice that when Mencia does not support punchlines and laugh at his own sketches, he only makes exaggerated observations that seem to lack any sense of humor. You ever notice how people in Buick's driving really slow? It's like Dah Duh Nah! Not even midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from Mencia's clear lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wet bag" that he constantly and adamantly proclaims to be, making him stunning. <br /> <br /> If something good could be said about Mencia, it is his effort. The man obviously has no talent, but as a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows that he is trying.
