I appreciate the efforts the filmmakers wanted to portray the story of Moses and Israel's exodus, and that the film helps viewers to familiarize themselves with Moses 'shoes and understand the great burden of Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to watch this movie, I was very disappointed with the story. (I want to leave the videograph, special effects and artistic abilities of this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical uncertainty of this film and how it is so far from the historical accounts of biblical texts. One of the main principles of the Bible is that * God * led his people out of Egypt, and he promised that he would take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. Not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a cloud of goggles during the day and a tribal fire at night. He never left them; He was always visible to the Israelites. The film, however, depicts a God who remains silent throughout the journey through the desert. This film changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead shows God as a quiet, cruel, disciplinary void. Moreover, the notion of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be such a father figure to Israel through the Old and New Testaments, though Moses is known as a faithful man). However, the film portrays him as a pragmatic, sour, insecure lonely who despises the call that God has put on his life. OK, I allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the Exodus story ... but this is beyond creativity - it's heresy.
