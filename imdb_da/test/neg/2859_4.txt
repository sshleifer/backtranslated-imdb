Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. It's not terrible either. The action was at least wood on the part of Pinocchio. The doll had all 2 expressions. As did most of the actors, except oddly enough ... the secondary characters ... Most of them were fun over the top. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this are beautiful "B" and as I said before, the puppet really blown. <br /> <br /> The two best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand ... so good, I think they used a 1/3 of the budget on it ... and the shower ... WOW ... I think they should have used other 2 / 3rds of the budget to talk to the actress who did the scene to do it. Outstanding. <br /> <br /> Seriously this is a slightly below average "b" horror puppet ... renting Chucky if you have a call to see puppets kill. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough to make me see it to the end.
