This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Can anyone explain the reason for this movie to me? Yes, I know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass didn't work, but what? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this movie, but for me it was an absolute waste of time. My recommendation? Don't bother, there are far better movies to be seen. This movie coincides with my second low-term low (Going overboard - Adam Sandler and Four at Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
