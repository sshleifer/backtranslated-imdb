This was just a horrible movie. I've seen it once when I was about 12, I'm now 19, and I don't think I'll ever forget this movie. I still feel sick when I think about it, it was just awful that could possibly fit in a movie. I really don't understand what kind of person will enjoy this complete rubbish. It's not enough to just turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the stupidest Disney movies on TV, as much as the next person, but it's something completely different. Usually I don't like judging a movie until I've seen it myself, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. Don't watch this movie.
