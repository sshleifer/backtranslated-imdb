by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I am happy to look forward to this. I enjoy Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star hand makes a vehicle to himself or when someone who writes decides to mark his own direct debut. But when the star's head gets too big for the rest of the body, there is always the danger of a huge budgetary Hollywood vanity. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker keep it right? or will he just waste amounts of money (the studio, ours) and time (studios, ours and his own) patting on their backs for an hour in half? Unfortunately, the latter is here. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really like is when someone draws new and new life into an exhausted and dehydrated genre. None of this. The warring nightclub films have become so worn that even the parodies of it are boring and made to death. <br /> <br /> Neither does Murphy. He does most klichéd: He plugs into a routinely conventional formal gangster image and plays it as seriously as it was "The Godfather". It's like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas. But it seems that someone with the clout just looked at it and went: "No, that's fine." <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. He is credited with this. In the opening shot of beautiful white satin plates, his name crosses over the credits about five times. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor adopts the little ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, Pryor's dump has become a top-class hot spot. They pull big money and a gangster wants their action. He even has a dirty policeman in his employment. But Pryor comes up with a scheme, a la "THE STING." <br /> <br /> Murphy's manuscript plays as an unfinished first draft that no one had mated to call him. The actors are not allowed to stop much if at all. Even the almighty Murphy seems to be on auto-pilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and gentleman manners like Sugar Ray (perhaps it would have been better to name his character BROWN Sugar Ray's additional evidence that this needed a Polish), but all here are basically just seen on vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination film received is really deserved (Joe I. Tompkins' Best Costume Design), but the production values ​​are the only part that makes the 30s feel authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets look a little fake, but it's supposed to be a kind of comedy. It is rare that a movie is nominated for both a Razzie and an Oscar (unless it is one of Lucas' new "Star Wars" chapters). It is 1938, and everyone speaks as if it were 1988, especially comedians. This is a prehistoric white man's formula. And with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to break the genre or at least bring new life to it. Nix. Murphy is basically just coasting here. The great Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he noted in his review: "Murphy is approaching its story more like a costume party where everyone makes it look good while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938. "Jasmine Guy is completely cast and seems to be devoted to his role, and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evil and mannerisms of prototypical mob boss down pat. And there are moments when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what more interesting leader and authority figure sounds like. He gives each scene a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask for Della Resse to sing? Or at least join in embarrassed with all his "Kiss My Ass talk"? <br /> <br /> And the late scared Foxx won't leave much of a swan song here. He has some back and forth with Resse who could have been some good things. Nix. Murphy is wasting another opportunity here again. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and sympathetic. But those moments are few and far between certainly. Murphy has never looked better and never been obscure. His character made me laugh twice throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible speech disorder is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. There's more to comedy than just showing something uncomfortable. You need to incorporate some kind of light touch and fun situation. When he looks at him, even those some of the easiest words, we get sad and annoyed with Murphy. Can Murphy Write a Manuscript? Well?? that was "raw" but it was really stand-up material. He wrote the explanation of "Boomerang" and "Coming to America". But she didn't have the last word there. Perhaps a team of ER-like script doctors could have revived this. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet, you would swear he slept a little at the wheel some time. He has too many static shots and does not seem to know how to build and release tension. At some level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. But occasionally charming. Now if he was just funny once. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy has a five-faced bed in bed that plans to love him and kill him. You might guess how it turns out. Like everything else in the movie, it could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy hasn't directed another movie since (he got a Razzie nomination). And he also doesn't write the finished draft of his films, either he (WON the Razzie for writing this!) It's great to watch and the music is beautiful, and there are a couple of really nice scenes. But it just falls under the category of "gemstones among everything undesirable." Not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Couldv'e been. Should've been. Was not it. Oh good. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
