After Kenneth Opel's narrative story about it refreshing me back in the joy of reading in the school, I had great hopes for this series. The story of an underdogy voyaging all over the country for reuniting with his colony imprisoned my imagination and reasoning deeply with my thriving imagination. After hearing this series, I started browsing the Bardel Animation site and liked what I saw. The sign design looked impressive, and the fast plot seemed to be stretched respectably over a thirteen episode arc. Very disappointed when I decided to see an early morning again. <br /> <br /> The opening section shows our completely Shade Silverwing, pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. By rejecting an echo acoustic song we see a nifty if the unclean CGI effect illuminates the mill, and the hunt takes a frenetic ride, as the little insect creates many illusory copies of itself, deceiving its successor. As a lover of biology, I had a decent understanding of the principles in place (tiger mills can feel the sounds that their predators use for echolocation and spin a sound cover to themselves) but without such an exhibition I would certainly be lost. One less vague thought I thought. Surely the director will fill us up at the moment. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> When our protagonist has settled with some of his fellow human beings, we are treated to some of the coolest dialogues I've ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's childhood rival, is starting to cheat the least with the stupid lines I've ever seen on a show. I can understand the authors who do not produce Shakespeare, but you think they would have had social contact in their lives - probably enough to make communication a natural way. Oh how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> The voice, but not horrible, was hardly a shining example of human achievement. "Oh shadow, you're broken the law!" Shades mother sucks emptily. "You must come with me, the young one." croaks Frieda, the wizened elder of the Silverwing Colony. The actors try, but it hardly means anything at this time as the story gets smaller and less convincing with every pass minute. <br /> <br /> While each episode deals with a week's problem, as is typically the case for most TV shows, overall story arches permeate the story, for better and worse. While the main point of history is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes adhere to other history arches involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and animals. The authors are trying to do too much at once and are struggling to compress as many promising ideas as possible, hoping that it will get hold of audience interests enough to keep the bloody show going. Unfortunately, these attempts are in vain for everyone, but the eight to ten year olds who show this show. While it is nice to see Canadian media continue, it would be all the sweeter if the pleasure of the series was not limited to the immediate family of the animators or foaming fans of Kenneth Oppel's books. There are worse things besides your kids can see than Silverwing, but far better programs are out there as well. Take care of mediocrity and read the books instead.
