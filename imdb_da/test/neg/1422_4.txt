This is a standard action flick that we have seen many times before. Not much action in this though. Again, it's about the guy who protects the president. He is macho - as usual and at the same time soft and melancholy - as usual. Does he have the courage to take a ball for the president? And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around. Stereotypical and predictable to last toe-crumbling minute.
