Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polish classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by cruel Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a witchcraft once again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, Satan's son preaches for world domination. It's not really scary and bright years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, author Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen choose a Satan-worshiping thriller full of many chanting, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time. Gordon is the only one left over from the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy, and a very hammy Ray Milland plays Roman castevets, subbing for the late Sidney Blackmer. Newbie McHattie is the film's only real saving grace. He is very off-kilter and looks really scary without doing anything. The music of Charles Bernstein is appropriately scary, but so overused, it ends up being intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen, who edited the former Polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety at all.
