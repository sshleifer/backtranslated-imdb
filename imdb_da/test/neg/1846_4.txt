Of course, the man who wrote the script for this movie has never heard any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many bugs in a biopic, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years of Desi. I could write a whole list of erroneous errors, but it would go on to pages. All in all, I think Lucille Ball is one of the infinite people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be overwhelmed by how many errors were made in this movie. The film authorities tried hard but the movie seems terribly dull for me.
