While it is unusual in color for another cordless furnace, the living women's lead clothing fails to bring any life to the flat straight manuscript. "The plot" is about the young people who have recently been released on the slogan and are trying to go straight, but are being persecuted by an avenged ex-Pinkerton man (a backdrop that chews Fred Clark) and a femme fatally determined to involve them in their bank robberies, whether or not they want to. As Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is big and hunky enough, but his "cool" demeanor and woodworking skills undermine things. The action standard is honest, no better than a Gene Autry or Roy Rogers television episode with Colt .45's, which never needs reloading and ghastly shooting skills that allow a horse picker to shoot from the hip and wound a man from at least 50 feet. ..Oh God...
