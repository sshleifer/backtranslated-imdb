The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it was themed music for the TV show IRON CHEF (although it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie get so bad?!?! Now the plot was approx. 95% predictable and the signs were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue?! Which person would actually afford to receive credit to come up with STUPID macho bull-crap claiming to be a dialogue? You get much more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so horrified by the hackneyed clich√©s and rotten dialogue that it quickly becomes tiring. And it's a shame because firefighters deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie - WAY over what you'd expect to find. They didn't care enough about preparing all the kinks and problems. So as a result, the film seems to be rushing and needs a rewrite and re-edit.
