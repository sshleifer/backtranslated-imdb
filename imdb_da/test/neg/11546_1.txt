This film aims to show a middle-class family's attempt to find out what "goes down" in America in the late 1960s. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their renovated old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> To know which well-established Hollywood players were desperate for a paycheck these days, just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten how badly his career had hit the skis! Thank goodness, his career rose before his incredible death. The writers on this television turkey were clueless. Without weeding, their insight into the "hippie movement" was ridiculous.
