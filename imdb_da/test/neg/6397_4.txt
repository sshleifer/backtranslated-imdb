All in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that takes you back to 1983, it will definitely do it. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for two reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> <br /> # 2. , the culture and music of Brazil <br /> <br /> The film is almost completely borne by Caine, as he commits himself to the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-credible story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper are missing. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is pure class as always. Besides being a gifted classic and comic actor, Caine brings a mix of introspection, evil and sensitivity to any movie he makes ... focus on his charm as far back as his role in Alfie ... and the reason he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce he is stunning ... fun and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental .... and besides the jewel, which is Rio de Janeiro, the only reason not to seek a better form of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a glimpse of the 2 lovely young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But look is all you can do with Michelle (although her appearance seems very dated) .... there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than seeing her "try" to act (most of her dialogue also works overdubbed ). Demi's play and appearance keep up 100 times better and you can easily transplant her like in any movie today (she doesn't look very different from honest). Mrs. Moore is certainly underutilized, especially considering that she was the biggest star in 2. <br /> <br /> Save the fact that it is a silly farce, in the end I am actually a bit like the maturity that all these people handle this scandalous situation ... that it does not end up friendships or marriages, and that an affair, even with the best friend of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can continue. The victims show anger and disappointment at what happened, but everything goes for the best .... a little unrealistically safe, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always.
