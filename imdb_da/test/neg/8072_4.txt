Cuore Sacro combines smooth film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screenwriters for "Touched by an Angel" might have gone up to be too false, Ozpetek still keeps us at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on positive, but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and horrible that I think the couple who jumped to their death at the beginning could have been the lucky ones. <br /> <br /> This movie is at heart (saying calculated) a story built on a great twist-style ending. This kind of heavy foundation can result in a tremendous success as Tornatore's Una Pura Formalità or godly waste as a movie by M. Night Shyamalan. The Cuore Sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter. I found the cinematography generally to be above average. Irene's tracking competitions, which are obliged to make their quota cover in the pool, were very impressive as the atmosphere was faced with the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes in from the rain and Irene poses with him is a bit of a stretch. One major problem I took exception to in this movie was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the protagonist's face and recording the emotions that take place. This worked for great effect in Facing Windows, but when it is employed here, it seems that Bubolova is not the Mezzogiorno. In fact, besides the ridiculous story, the main problem with this movie is milquetoast the notion of the main character. That made the final crash scene even more invincible. <br /> <br /> In this movie Ozpetek continues his crusade against our business-driven society by encouraging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And although I'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience was hit over the head with a mute object. Could the characters have been more two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very enervating and fun. Was the "evil" Aunt Eleonora something more than a caricature? This also applies to the people on the side of "right" as the "good" aunt Maria Clara and the elder doorman Aurelio. And only if we might have missed Ozpetek's point, he decided to dress his opposite forces in their own liveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about the instructor's use of color. He dresses the opening couple, who shortly take flight in all black, as well as Irene (when we first meet her and after her livelihood), the evil Aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that indicates a particular course, the wearer's mind is set and numb. It is the option that suits the indispensable element of modern armor, the costume. It is also the color of grief, like the funeral spree exercised by the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of evil, as the simple clothes of priests and nuns, which Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color and a very suitable choice for a film about the sacred heart is red. It is a color that has an extremely inherent emotional component. The character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; It challenges our perceptions of the user and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable. But red carries a huge weight of history and mystery when the earliest members of Cro-Magnon's man buried their dead in red ocher, and the first man named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor that looks back on the past how red (and by uniting a less self-driven attitude to life) was more accepted. So when we come across the red room (the mysterious frozen covered walls complete with a red acclaimed menorah and a red painting by a Whirling Dervish!) Of Ireses mother, "good" characters have Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing glowing red clothes, and Finally, the painting of Ire's mother in a formal red dress we can see where Ozpetek's sympathy lies. <br /> <br /> A word or two about the soundtrack, I found the original musical themes to be excellent for the story. The quasi-baroque theme that denotes Irene was great for its monotony and sense of unpleasant creepy (the absolute best use of a constantly repeated Baroque theme such a thing should be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with the masterful repetition of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to Trade). An absolutely inspired choice was a few seconds of an opera aria we hear as the stream flickers, while Irene chases Benny through the house. It is from the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from Catalani's opera "La Wally". The Aria is sung by the driver's seat that leaves home forever. When Irish's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess that this is a recording of her song and that she says a colorful farewell to her daughter, who in the movie Irene is soon destined to never see Benny alive again. I just have a minor question about the soundtrack, why does the famous tango include Yo Soy Maria? I love the song and could personally hear it all the time, but it didn't fit very well here.
