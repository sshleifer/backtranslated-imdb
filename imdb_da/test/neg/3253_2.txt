Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy where a copy is inferior to the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. They are trying to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now, in a few cases, this works. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight when they play pretty much the same character. I actually like Randy Quaid, who is no more or less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse of all, C2 once and for all demonstrated that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors all the time. There is very little that I like him in, and the C2 nailed coffin closed on his "comic" career as far as I'm concerned. He seems to feel the same, sticking more to tuffy like Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi Factor. Apart from that, it is mostly "done there" to Caddyshack 2. See the original twice instead of each version once and you get more for your rental fees.
