I'm waiting for Peter Fonda to start trading. For anyone coming from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda and try to play another. And that's the good news in this disappointing dog about adapting The Tempest. A number of loosely linked ideas that only suggest a relationship with Bart's great game is what we are served. The setting is the Civil War and Prospero's (here's Guide's) evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain, complete with Snidely Whiplash mustache. I waited for him to go "Uh ha hah!" which would have been a highlight of this boring presentation. None of the supporting shocks were noticeable, and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the flawed story over and over again. <br /> <br /> Tempest is Bard's statement of rage of human unjust treatment of humans. The only credible character was the Gator man, the Caliban counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had options, but the resident war setting just didn't. All in all, a very disappointing production. I watched it on video and would advise if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix, save your money on this. Rent something else, like Branagh's much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.
