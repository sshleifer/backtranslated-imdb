A `Wacky Chick 'flick. A beauty competitor wins up dead, and the usual suspects are rounded off. Another entry into the Texas Cheerleader vein, this is an average example of its type. Yasmine Bleeth turns in her usual healthy girl, and Jill Clayburgh does a good job as she is stressed out a little occupied mother. <br /> <br /> Some mildly fun moments listening to the clumsy self-service PR coming out of the participants' mouth. ("I want to own a restaurant so I can feed the homeless.") <br /> <br /> Ask yourself what people are using for brains when thinking of a cheerleader or beauty crown is worth killing for! <br /> <br />
