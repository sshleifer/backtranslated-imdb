This is a good example of what could have been a good movie and a good idea, but turned out to be really bad in the process. I was mostly tempted to get it because of the DVD cover, stupid me, but I did anyway, and I was blown away in the bad sense. This movie is essentially about El Chupacabra, which causes chaos around Los Angeles, and it's up to a local animal politician and author to save the day before two corrupt police and two evil scientists bring them down. The main reason I did not like this movie was due to large continuity errors that were hard to not notice. Along with some bad plays, okay lighting and nothing scary, this movie didn't hit me as much as it probably should have. But in comparison with other Chupacabra films, this one is definitely topped in the cards. Only at first is the continuity of this film far away, and I mean from the shoulders and into the ditch. There were so many points where the characters said or did something and then in the next shot, they didn't, or the change never happened. In a point: The protagonist has a gun, the Chupacabra attacks, he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun is missing. The girl runs while defending here with the mystic flair and she had no gun, so the protagonist runs with the girl and has the gun. Where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun. The time of day is turned up. One minute there are sunsets and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight. There were some plot holes like in, why was Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived? These things bugged the heel out of me and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> Next on the list is the actor. Boy was it wood and bad. The main character of Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems a little too quiet on points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a couple of dogs, and when a tragedy struck, his emotions were just not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of a best-selling book on Chupacabra, and she just didn't like her role or performance. Her acting was a bit ridiculous and poor. Even for a writer, she knows too much about it, and knows how to disable a high security defense in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was okay, but he seemed a little quiet for some of the things that were going on. The movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for any crime-free show, where the actors and actresses are not really involved in their work. I rarely get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie I could not be hard at lighting. It took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed. There were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comic bookish," but it was back. The worse part is at night when it's pit black outside, but the scene is so covered with light, it seems like its day. They continue to shift from high-intensity light to soft light to random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors quarrel. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows at night. During the sunset, when the lighting was perfect, it was the only time the light was good, except that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no scare in this movie. There was only once when I jumped, but apart from that, it wasn't scary. There were points where it could probably have been scary, but it was such astonishing light that one could see Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even the creature design for Chupacabra was poor, it looked good, but it was a short man or a child in a jump suit. They did not hide his face; they showed him without any mystery or enigmatic appearance. There were quite a few things, but it seemed unreal. This movie was just not scary, it's all. Overall, they Americanized a great South American legend to a bloodthirsty human eating which Chupacabra is not. In fact, it was scared of humans, and it only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans. But when would the story be? I didn't like this movie for any reason, but I will give them credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you should check this out. Also, if you are easily tempted by cult classics, you will enjoy this movie. I didn't, I can't see it again, but in a deeply stunned way, I enjoy this kind of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
