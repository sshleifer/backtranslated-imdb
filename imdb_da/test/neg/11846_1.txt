First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it almost 10 times just because I wanted to spread the delicious tasteless interior of this movie to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a handheld camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has everything written by a WWE fight. And most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an almost instant mutilation of three drowning teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was on something great when I picked this movie from the DVD rack (was pulled on the box due to the graphics of a velociraptor shouting the word "RAPTOR" on the front of it). The scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humor and rubbery dinosaur dolls that are repeated throughout the film. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie features erratic scenery and plug-in that makes you melt at the thought that someone can just get as little shame when it comes to making a movie. An example is when a truck in the middle of the night is parked next to a rock wall. The very next day they find it in an open grass area. The driver could not have run it there when he had his face bitten by a naming by-catch carnivore (I will explain why it is named in a second). So my only guess is that either the velociraptor ran it, the pet that the driver was carrying, or Jim Wynorski didn't think much about his viewers. Hell, on the one hand, they expect me to think that they are going down the main street at night when the road does not have gutters, the fire burner is unsafe next to a telephone booth and there is only one street light. Still, I feel compelled to watch and watch this movie again, so I can find more things that make me giggle the next time I see it. This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The management of this movie is horrible. Long extended breaks. Strange cuts to characters that were not even in the general vicinity of the conversation. People discuss things randomly as they face the camera (and again make them face to the wall). They can't even give the dinosaur a cohesive species that switches between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (characterized by the intensely long, fat, excessive claw). This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Editing is prominent in this movie. This is not a good thing. I am well aware that the movie is a collection of scenes from other movies, masterfully crafted in a single piece of shit, but there must be a limit! Subplotter ends as abruptly as they began. Explanations that sudden disappearance of characters is not limited to, yes, not explained at all! And one end that felt like driving a muscle car in a wall without a seat belt. You just never know what will happen because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This film is a masterpiece. Now I just need to mention a single scene (the largest) that occurs near the end. This is a spoiler, but not really. The final scene contains a showdown between Tyrannosaurus Rex and Sheriff Tanner. It is like the rally between Sigourney Weaver and Alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic battle. It consists pretty much of the tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. A white bobcat. In a few minutes, the director managed to turn the white bobcat into a yellow forklift / crane looking out of machines. Now, as I said, do I know that this movie is made of scenes from other movies, but which two films guarantee a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This film is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1/10 for the quality of filmmaking, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself.
