Rutger Hauer, together with a film, which can basically be summed up in the young person who finds himself category, and quite clearly so, so it needs a lot of help. The beginning gives much more promise of a movie that can become Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got hooked in the beginning. Then it went like an open soundtrack from big and exciting to virtually no place. It's fun enough with lots of curiosity and interesting characters worked well. I'm sure it will be enough for many people. The problem is that the whole thing feels constructed and empty, which, ironically, must be the most important discovery for the character's self-realization. Not the movie itself (it's not a self-conscious movie), but the character must recognize his own life is constructed and empty.
