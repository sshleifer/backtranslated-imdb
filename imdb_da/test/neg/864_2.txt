This film was produced by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although their writers boast about it as a biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made, and their actors even dare say they didn't get an Oscar Nomination because of it's political relevance to oil (-he he, right) ... Well, this is all a lie. This film was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like topic) and the secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with a US oil company wishing to investigate oil deposits in the region , but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now it can have some nice pictures about beaches, but it is; nothing bigger than that ... it's all in the camera. Most of the actors are miserable, except for two or three. The rest lacks sense of what works: they take over most of the time. The story is plain and cliché, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said. Because the crew announced it as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is nothing impressive, it is very simple and the dialogues are not much thought. It has also got some editing problem on a few scene changes ... but in addition it is pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he is not like an Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he had. I would like to question him why instead of using the Costarican actor he spent most of the money on strangers. I think they brought about being a 100% Costarican Production ... that's what you expect at least. Finally, the end is not well done, there are errors and details that do not match or are useless. Besides being the most elaborate film throughout Costarican history, I think it's mediocre. You can make the road more interesting and better pictures with less money. Never heard of "Pi"? Anyway, if you're curious about Costa Rica or Central American movies, this one will do, but you're definitely not missing anything.
