Jeff Speakman never did it beyond the lowest ranks of martial arts players-turned actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with cars like "The Expert" you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The reason - or should I say plots - is everywhere, there are some signs that get a lot of screen time, but serve a little purpose, 2) There are only 4 battle scenes In total, some completely independent of the main plot and some happening in the dark 3) The music score is excessive and indulgent. Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this movie: the score is constantly trying to convince you that you see some kind of grand epic instead of the low-budget-limited action movie you actually see. All in all, there is at least James Brolin around to give a touch of credibility. * 1/2 out of 4
