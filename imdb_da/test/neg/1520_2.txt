As a big fan of the series, I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I was eagerly requested a laugh one minute roller coaster ride ...... unfortunately. start this mess? I think it's a good start to say that it is hardly rich and eddie on our screens in the first place, since none of the jokes and a liners they usually deliver so well are fun. I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minute show. Many aspects of the story were pathetic, and it was as if the movie was full of the bad moments they practiced and decided to leave the final cut. <br /> <br /> The overall set and atmosphere around the movie is dark and dingy, which I suppose is good if they want to portray the "horrible" guesthouse, the 2 buffoons are trying to drive, but for me it just puts one even higher cushioning in a dull state of filming should never have been created. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, it is pathetic. Fella Fielding is wasted as the luney wife F oxfur and I have seen Simon Pegg have much better excursions. I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is blind full because they might appreciate the terrible sayings much more. But to any bottom fan, who hasn't seen this movie and expects true richie and eddie action you've been warned about
