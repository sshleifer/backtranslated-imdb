A special unit of four police detectives discloses justice in their own unique way in the 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's leading officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also contributing are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. A pretty impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is even extremely impressive about this movie. Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns out to be dead in a distant urban development. Our band with four detectives is called, and it is immediately obvious that Nolte's Max Hoover will take a very personal interest in this case. We will soon find out that Allison, in addition to knowing Hoover, was also quite involved in some very important military and governmental forms that may have had reason to have her death. But who was exactly involved and why would they certainly have this apparently harmless woman dead? Hoover and crew set out to find out. It sounds like an interesting premise, but unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive selection of names, the play here leaves much to be desired. Nolte overcomes, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come out as caricatures, Penn hardly has anything to do, and Griffith is boring as it may be. By far the best performance is Connellys in overly flashy flashback sequences. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wood. The feeling of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is completely missing. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, it does not seem to happen for most of the picture. Instead, we just turned to a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. Once the "mystery" is resolved, you may find yourself saying, "Oh, come on, is that all there is?" But it gets worse after the mystery is solved, we get a completely ridiculous and completely unbelievable sequence of actions. And even then, we are made to suffer longer as another horrible, badly acted, completely unnecessary scene gets stuck in the end. And so merciful it is over. And not a moment too soon.
