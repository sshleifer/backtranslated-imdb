I've seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them I was forced to watch. And I didn't like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us such amazing shows as Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? My problem is not just with Dan, it's also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for an Emmy, but it is far better than Zoey 101. The actors of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show, let's just hope for your pregnancy, who will affect the show or better, but it will get it canceled.
