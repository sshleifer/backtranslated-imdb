The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two main players are good and it was not shot at VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talking / Driving Zombi coming back to vote and swing the political tide against the war! Give me a break! What next, zombies coming back to go shooting? Maybe zombies coming back to host QVC shows? <br /> <br /> I never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful as it shot the true war of war. <br /> <br /> With zombies being mass-produced in today's market ... this is SPAM of zombie-related entertainment. How "Homecoming" made it "Masters of Horror" is beyond me.
