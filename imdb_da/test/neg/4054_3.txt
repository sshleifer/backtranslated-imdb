Tender Hook, or who killed the Australian film industry? Case 278. This excused excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential ?? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a jazz-era gangster drama ?? and transforms it into a dormant paced and executed soporific. McHeath (Weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and acting illiterate; Without apparent reason, he is allowed to sing Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen songs before the outbreak. How to postmodern. How stupid. Nevertheless. There is a boxer, art (Matthew Le Nevez) who will be McHeath's latest protégé, over his unfortunately aboriginal staff member Alby (Luke Carroll). McHeath's flapper minor Iris (Byrne) makes the goo-goo eyes on Hello M. Sexual tension twisted beneath the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Irris (these flower girls stick together) who continue to turn up in scenes unannounced. They practice dancing together and talking about "hooking up" with guys. In the 1920s. I stopped counting anachronism after that. There is a sublot with Japanese beer and a backstory of Broome pearl fishers. I don't know what it was all about. For some reason that is not exactly (explained), Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath thinks he is a full-blown guy. Byrne plots and arrangements to help him out again. She is a big one for plotting and skimming. Most of them cause problems. McHeath's two gannels, portly Ronnie (John Batchelor) and Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin) debate on McHeath when he realizes their role in one of Irri's arrangements, but Ronnie knocks out when he sees McHeath crying. A lot of practically outrageous scenes get in the way of the movie eventually. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with film photographer Geoffrey Simpson, who creates some beautiful images, but completely fails to generate a sense of style that could have compensated for and decorated the sparse, pathetic underpowered script; Unfortunately, Ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring scenes and exhibitions, is surprisingly incompetent. In an early stage, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. How she got there, and actually who she is, seems to have slipped Ogilvie's mind. There are many more examples of this dullness. Where he chases poetic energy, he only gets irritation. He wins awkward performances from actors who are usually reliable, poorly miscasting. Weaving and leaning on Byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll-like humanity while being put into her with an incomprehensible character. It can't be that much if the story had more significant characters and stronger plotting, preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with whitish sprinkled pop culture quotes. But it doesn't. It's boring.
