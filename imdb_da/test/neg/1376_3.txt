I have only seen most series since I leave the television as background noise in my dormitory. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of Mencia, but this show doesn't do much for me. Occasionally he will say or do something to pull out a chuckle, but he has this aura of smugness that completely destroys it. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his furious angry man it's not terribly widespread in this television series. Instead, he is just lean. I guess that just reflects how fun his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when he's not in the right form of delivery. I've seen him get into it sometimes at his show, but mostly he just sits there and smiles and it doesn't fit well with him. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion.
