Being a big horror movie fan, one of the hardest things to consider the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre, and having seen hundreds of them in my life, I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired lame and poorly finished piece of garbage I have had the accident to see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! It's so bad, it's not even ridiculous. The special effects (I said "special"?) Were probably achieved using a few grand, the play is terrible, and the script should have ended up in the trash after the first reading of the studio, which decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a store. Also for you out there who like nudity in your movies, don't be fooled by the R class. If you think, you get the chance to see Erika Eleniak yourself half-naked, you're wrong. She is fully covered throughout the film. And the cover is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even resembles the amazing coworkers they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this movie a -10. Be warned. Don't waste your money or your time on this one.
