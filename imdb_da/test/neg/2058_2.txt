This movie is just shit, I can't tell it differently. You know, since the beginning, that it's getting bad. <br /> <br /> The story, dialogue, action, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. I like vampire movies, and I know they will never be Oscar-winning movies, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how anyone produced this thing. It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... does not exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they were trying to do, but I doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to pull, but it was just one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life (and I have seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this) favor and DO NOT see this. <br /> <br /> P.S. It's also full of clich√©s! P. S. 2 bad script, poor instruction, poor filmography. P. S. 3 I have bothered to comment on this as an advantage to everyone.
