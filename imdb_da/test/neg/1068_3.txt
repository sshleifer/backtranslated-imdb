This movie made me think .... of how I could write something about it without telling the director and all the actors that I, as an Australian, am proud of actually coming out and making a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story .... Found this DVD in my local rental store yesterday and had vague memories of the reviews at the time of cinema release here, so I thought I'd give it a go. <br /> <br /> For some reason I decided to see the special features before I saw the actual movie, not something I usually do. Turned 'making off' halfway through which I had enough to cringing on 'we are not so wonderful to put together such a hard-hit movie with such a crude script's attitude. <br /> <br /> The movie? Ugh. Full of clich√©s and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys, you are Aussies and I welcome you. And just as a football team is just as good as the coach who leads them, you unfortunately do NOT have a good script to work with. I felt that the movie actually trivialized so many issues that it seemed to cover. I've seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing but a soap. Finally (and forgive me, if I do not express this correctly), I was very disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes, we all know that life is filled with hard things, and yes, we know that things like incest occur, but I find it hard to applaud a movie that has no joy in it. I think a director has a responsibility to put it in there. Otherwise, the film is about them and their emotions, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> As I think is the basis for why this movie is not so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the manuscript in a 36-hour meeting, the next day he tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, but the film series of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. "I feel terrible, I have to write a movie about feeling horrible". (Note: I've read the interview with Andrew Urban and understood why Thalluri should write something to help him through his own problems, but I think there is a line in movies that can't be crossed - the line to make a movie solely for your own emotional needs, and I feel this is what happened unintentionally here) <br /> <br /> By its own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and unfortunately that is what makes the movie look like nothing more than a year twelve media projects. <br /> <br /> As if any recommendations that this movie should be studied in school or that all teenagers should see it - not sure either. Because there is a very dangerous line at the end. I have also been to a place where I have believed that a person who is no longer 'meeting life' is 'lucky', but as an adult I worry that this line might be influential on a young seer who was in a vulnerable mood. May be in there to promote discussion, but again it does not reflect the possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Elephant, but I can only find it, given all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> No personal here guys, I hope you can make another movie one day, and we all have to start somewhere, forgive me if I've been too hard. I am glad that you are proud of what you have created, which is what life is about. It's not a movie I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Oh, as the time frames often collided, I thought it was an interesting way to film. <br /> <br /> But the whole "It's the quiet you should see" - we already know.
