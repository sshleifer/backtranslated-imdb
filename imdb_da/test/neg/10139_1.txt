Reba is undoubtedly one of the worst "comedy" series ever. I wonder how people come to write good comments on "Reba" ... You see "Friends", "Gift Wtih Children", "Fraizer" if you laugh at it, you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer trying to make her comedy and of course has no chance of it. The actors / actors next to Reba are ok, so I feel bad for those who are stuck in a so-called comedy show with the least fun person in the world (Reba). Together, I suggest this TV show to see how low comedy can and appreciate those who can make you laugh
