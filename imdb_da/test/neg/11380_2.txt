First of all, I love Demons and Demons 2, I saw them, even though it was hard to find good horrors without good official films that were distributed here in Russia when I was a child, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. Then I heard nothing about Mr. Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it's certainly not a good return! Why was the leading character that we never really knew for at least like him in an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so stupid and stupid things about the soul of man? Why is the plot so primitive? Have we not seen enough ghosts in 100 years of film production? Obviously, Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us so far. It's a shame.
