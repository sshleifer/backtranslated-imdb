It's hard to decide where to start. I bought this for a couple of quid and it is the worst couple quid iv ever wasted. The back of the DVD had no pictures and a few lines of plot summary, this should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies to laugh, so decided to give it a try. The film consists of three short stories, each revolving around a person who was on a particular bus at a time. (It is never clear what the bus is important or which city is in) <br /> <POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there is something to be spoiled) The first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to to do so, against his wife's wishes. The car is like a demonic hum and takes over his life. <br /> <br /> The other is about a veil of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacterium grows out of it. <br /> <br /> The third about a woman going to a dating agency just to discover her date is not that normal. <br /> <br /> In between, we are treated to shots of the bus (or a bus anyway), while telling whitles on a load of relationships about relationships (really, it's like he's on commission to say "relationships" ) In fact, the film has no redeeming properties at all. The action, costumes and the little Spfx are all disgus things.There are even some attractive female cast members to admire. Simply put, this movie is a debacle.
