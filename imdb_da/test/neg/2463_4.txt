"We have another movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment - much of what involves the band's occasional fun lyrics - in a 90-minute package." For anyone who is old enough to remember, this is in line with the first "Bill and Ted" without the story. If that doesn't say enough about how brainless this movie is, think of Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and it's its selling point. If you actually like to listen to Tenacious D because of their musical skill, then bank yourself and buy the soundtrack. Don't waste your time with this though. If you are a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs, you still make the wrong tree. Regardless of the strength of your buds, you will still be left if you would have appeared in Grandma's Boy again instead.
