Wait until you see this .... I mean even after reading this review. No other movie to date has sucked more than this .... One thing I do not understand is that when you rip some English flicker, why should you add your own creativity? With the amount used to make this movie, manufacturers should have considered "Cellular" purchase rights to be dubbed into Hindi and released the movie. They could have got some profits in the way I guess. If there was a chance to judge this movie with a 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic notions come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played the side ticket to Aftab. I don't know if my problem is that I've seen Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but it may not be a reason to support this movie ... I could go for hours, but neither have I time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie, not I will remember the horrible scenes from the movie ..... please stay away from this flick.
