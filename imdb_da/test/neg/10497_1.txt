Amazingly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than such atrocities as "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and these movies are horrible. Author / Instructor / Star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic management concepts. Possibly the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and battle choreography I've ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together and you can't see much in the extrovert lighting. The horrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by an extremely unsigned cast that stretches the film to an almost deadly 87 minutes. This is a really ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, aficionados of horrible film production will see this, but it's very hard to get through, no matter how you experienced a poor movie viewer you are. The fact that Ron Hall thought this was actually releasable is amazing. If you are a movie director and you actually think it's OK for the opening license in your movie to include a few frames of the words SLOW before the title appears, back from your rough editing - and you can't seem to figure out the energy to edit that frame Of course, your standards are so low that they are insulting. I am surprised that Lions Gate / Maple agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite Rudy Ray Moore's very short cameo, this movie is a work of supreme confidence over Ron Hall's part - he clearly believes he is a formidable actor and must also believe he has superior writing and instructional skills - but the movie is So incredibly unfortunate that it is hard to believe that he actually wanted people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated as I do right now. An obnoxious, insane horrible movie. I'm not making fun.
