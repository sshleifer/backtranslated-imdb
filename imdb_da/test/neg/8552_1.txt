Sad ... really sorry. This movie has nothing (hmmm, maybe maybe Sybil Danning) to keep you going. It also made my eyes to see Linda Blair in this exploitation flick. She certainly deserves better. <br /> <br /> So what is the story about? Let's see ... Warden John Vernon binds the inmates in pretty inspiring positions while the prisoner Sybil actually runs the prison and little Linda has to fight to survive ... Sounds like a B movie, huh? It is.
