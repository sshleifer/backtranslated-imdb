Kim Basinger and the Mickey Rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery co-worker who begin a very experimental sexual relationship. Although Rourke and Basinger work ok, the flick does not allow their signs to really shape.

As it is a blank, well-produced, with MTV style editing piece soft core voyeurism. 4 out of 10
