After reading the novel, which is about an hour, read, then the film became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in Egypt's prince, Simon's Wells somehow managed to manage a script that removed all drama and mystery from his source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp, but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There was no excitement and the stupid bookend with the addys character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very offended when this movie was over, and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes, it went on forever. I wondered how the studio and the director could have the OK such a miserable script, but then my friend put the movie to me exactly as it was and I said wow it sounds good but what happened to the movie.
