This movie was a bad movie. The reason was poor, and the comedy they tried to deliver came out badly. The accidents seem to be constructed and predictable. I thought the actors were trying to some extent, but with this movie it was so boring that it can only go so far. One of the worst movies I've seen and not recommend to anyone. The only accident to Mr. Accident where it is release.
