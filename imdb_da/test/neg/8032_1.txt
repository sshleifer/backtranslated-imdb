This movie just stumped. I know some people will say that anyone who thinks it's not good "doesn't understand it." I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But it's completely drunk. The protagonist is so annoying that I couldn't care less what he did. He is, as said in another review, bouncing around as a slightly annoying monkey. I just couldn't stand him or force me to care. This is the case with most of the signs that just seem hard to be goofey or weird. I liked the Mel Gibson character and the Milla Jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. Milla is of course beautiful, pitiful, and you really feel for her and what she has been through and why she is the way she is. I see Gibson's character as almost Frankenstien as. I just wish he would have saved Milla and the Brown Hotel down with all the worthless tedious signs that lived in it. Milla Rating 10 Movie rating 0
