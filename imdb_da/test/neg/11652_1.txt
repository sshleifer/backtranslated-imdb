"Snowball Express" from Disney Studios is not as dated as some of their output from this era. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, just boring-like-dish Dean Jones inherits a ramshackle hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and the family enter a sleepy Colorado town, the people who give them directions - as an option from "Deliverance" - are curiously vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like a one bedroom shanty), but actually accommodation is very nice. Jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face all the way through (which doesn't prevent one of the local yahoos from learning on her), and of course, lumpy pop Dean Jones is a regular blunt album on the slopes, leading to many talk in slushen. Perhaps this square scenario may have benefited from some magic whimsy, for this script is a frozen stiff. * from ****
