I rented this pile of sewage waste and hoped for a couple of good laughs. With a title like "Zombie Bikers from Detroit" and with Dead Alive productions stamped on the front page, you'd think this could be a funny / cruel movie, but no. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the Police Academy movies). The story (this is a joke in itself) and the dialogue is terrible. The decoration of the so-called zombies looks like they used one of the two dollars. "Make yourself look like a Zombie kits you buy from K-Mart." <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while listening to the Backstreet Boys and being whipped by a 400lb New Year's birthday card model than sitting through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, some popsicle sticks and a slinky. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life was removed from me and taken to the land of Sucksdom. I know that Dead Alive production labeling does not guarantee a good flick, but you expect to get your money's worth. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (spades, returned the most gruesome mass of elephant feces) was that it wasn't the title `Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh '. I feel for Detroit people who wasted their hard earned money on this one. Unless you've been lobotomized ??. Don't buy, rent if you need to ?? But ??. You will regret it.
