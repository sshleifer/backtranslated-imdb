Some movies you see and you say, "Well, that didn't make any sense." And that doesn't really mean you. You just say things were too complicated or slightly obscene. <br /> <br /> "Bread and circus" makes no sense. And I mean it. And it's not because it's surreal. From the start, it is quite clear that making splatter special effects is a weak excuse. There is no script. There is no plot. There is no story of any kind. An event does not lead to the next - it is so basic the bad writing is here. <br /> <br /> So what? I think there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category. They will show you what they do, they give you a go. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because in this case "Bread and circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, in the ground - people crawl out of them. Earth, in space, two legs on both sides. These kind of pictures are wonderful, funny, odd, crazy. But the film doesn't do anything with them. <br /> <br /> Things happen that the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfactory. I suppose the manuscript was made on the go. Too bad. If there had been a story about something, it would have made for a much more entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is much like the beautiful car you will love to own. Then you lift the hood and there is no engine. Just a little man peddler a bike. <br /> <br /> GRR!
