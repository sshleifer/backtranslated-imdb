I couldn't help laughing when I saw what the public could think of was email back in 1996. Apparently, email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading each comment highly . And some of the other "tech" aspects are also laugh-amazing fun. I would swear "high tech" communication center she actually got some Commodore 64 screens in it. Almost like watching the movie Hackers today, I think. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the majority of the film engages the leading actress the illusion of being disabled, the latter part of the film has an inexplicable use of her legs that somehow cannot ignore . I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the plot is pretty predictable, it's acting badly, the killer is totally guessing. But it can be fun in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of way I guess.
