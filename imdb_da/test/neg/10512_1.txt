I rented this movie and expect it to suck and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine. <br /> <br /> It starts to suck before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the front is nowhere in the movie. It's called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin killing for hire? Now this guy kills his own will so it doesn't make him an assassin. <br /> <br /> So when you actually put the disk in it gets worst. First, the menu is animation lame. But when you actually start the movie, everything from the set design to the lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. You know a movie is bad when the credits themselves suck. The action is ridiculous. The action is childish. Scripture is elementary. And the steering is the worst>
