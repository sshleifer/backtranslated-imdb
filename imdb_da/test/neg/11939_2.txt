I really do not waste my time with in-depth analysis, I just want to say that I am very disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of starring in this absurd, foolish, in this full of clich√©s boring thoughtlessly pathetic try in film making! There is no point in trying to find the positive aspects of this movie, because on the whole it is poor in every way, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is pulled so uncompromisingly into the cliches that she absolutely does not have any chance to show yet 1% of her talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie yourself at the option of staying at home with the starring role on the wall !!!
