What can you say about a movie that makes two hours look like three weeks? The hero starts in ninjaville, Japan, undergoes an identity crisis (saves a shinobi), travels to America (saves a slave named Sam) engages in a small wild west act (rescues a French / Japanese Indian named Julie), hunting pirate Gold, then head back to Japan to fight a war. The film obviously has no idea where it comes at any time; I think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he had seen. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest renting the subtitle so that you and your peers can openly discuss how silly the movie is without talking over the movie, possibly missing another silly plot twist. <br /> <br /> Film Director during this movie - An American tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Interesting interests - Most fear inspiring line all the time. Ca. 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the movie, the protagonist just ordered an American villain, and just like a leader to quit the pain, the hero explains "Let's go back to Japan" and the pain continues for another week.
