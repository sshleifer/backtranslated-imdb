The director seems like a good, solid man. His parents struggle with the same problems that we all face. They left each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the poor public must sit through ninety minutes of what may be trials and tribulations for one of the most boring families ever coming out of Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting choices in this documentary - music is banal, the film is uninspired, and the story is the same story that has played out on every Birch Street in every city in America. I don't mean to sound too hard - rarely has a sweeter, more well-known documentary film been made. The director is the kind of man you want to be friends with. You just wished he'd struggled so much with presenting the material when his parents kept their marriage alive.
