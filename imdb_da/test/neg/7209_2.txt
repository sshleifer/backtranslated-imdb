SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of the movies I know is clich√©d and unoriginal, but it's done so well, I'm embarrassed to admit that I really like it. Shows many of my friends whose film positions I respect think the same way. So when they try to make a sequel to it, and it is as if it was written by some high school kids who got the rights to make a successor, it's just bad; Really, really bad. It is strange that Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the authors, and I can only hope that his WGA membership is revoked. Scripture was just bad, and all authors of this movie were to retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialogue in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be king of the straight-to-DVD sequel (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, I think his working ability does not exist. He was horrible, just awful. And it's not the horrible fighting situations that make this movie horrible, but take it from me, they're bad. Each battle scene is a slowly delivered punch (but still makes the "wiff" the sound in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent returning a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 1970-cop show. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fighting seem to have a mouth full of cherry cabbage help for some reason. And we must believe Will Patton is a fighting machine; his fighting scenes look so incredibly fake, I was honestly embarrassed to see. <br /> <br /> It is the complete interruption of logic in this ridiculous movie that makes it horrible. For example: Johnathon Schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells a girl he hardly knows who he has no idea which side she's on, "I'm with Feds but don't tell anyone." The female villain who fights the good girl in a combat situation with acrobatics competing with a superhero but still easily held down by Will Patton, "old guy" in another scene by just holding both her hands as he emits something ridiculous line ("stuck me once, shame on you, knife me twice, it's not going to happen", it's bad) and then mock her. Jake Busey's villain shoots at the fiddle while they are trapped in a drug deal, but no DEA agents or anyone simply goes to his place and picks him up, actually he simply escapes because "this is the sheriff's territory". Busey wants the bar because it is "in a good position" for drug deals, but his own house seems to be as well apparently offering all the perks the bar should have. Johnathon Schaech's character would be the son of Patrick Swayze's character in the original, but Swayze's character's name is Dalton, and Schaech is not (nor is the supposed brother of Swayze's character). And Johnathon Schaech sees about 50 of this movie. I looked it up, he is 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks awful. <br /> <br /> But my favorite absolute stupid scene in this movie was the most current movie scene that ended in movies: The villain is thrown through a window on another floor and as they spread, I think, "be kindly tell me he is impaled on something ... "and surely my worst fear was realized. <br /> <br /> In fact, I could go on for half an hour about the things I hated about this movie. Let's say we stop these ridiculous straight-to-DVD sequels for theatrical movies, at least those with Johnathon Schaech.
