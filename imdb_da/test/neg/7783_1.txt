I couldn't wait until the end. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that almost everyone could make a tough movie, these people show that there is a minimum skill requirement. This is a movie with no redeeming features at all. It scores a zero in each department. This is more than just 'amateur' as the audience is not given any consideration or whatsoever. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The story is pointless, meaningless and meaningless. The cast looks very uncomfortable and lacks direction completely. The technical aspects of the film are poor. <br /> <br /> As a DVD, it makes a great drink coaster.
