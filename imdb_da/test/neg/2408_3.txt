During my struggle to stay awake during this drill, I struggled through my near-dosage to discover a stupid plot about fraternity smack, quite incredibly annoying annoying, in trouble with a psychotic, radio-damaged half-man / half cyborg called Splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious political vocal leader (... for whom Splatter killed and enabled them to blame him for becoming the leader). These face-painted freaks are a group that expresses their feelings anarchically, but not violently, living on counterfeit streets abandoned by the "civilized world" expressing their concerns about nuclear disarmament. Still, most of the movie has these five frat goons running across dark streets with graffiti walls, like Splatter and his punks pursuing them. Fortunately for these guys, they find a punk chic to help them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain they are not familiar with. This territory, where frat guys are immersed, is a true maze of streets and spawns with the idea of ​​an exit most difficult, especially when the crazies and Splatter's pile occupy almost every turn. Yes, I was duped as others thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is most outstanding. If he had only been the designer of this boy ... this is not the case, and we the viewer left a film modeled on, of all movies, it looks like Walter Hills THE WARRIORS, except this movie, does not have the style or grit that movie has. The film has an abundance of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between frats and punks with hand-to-hand combat often ridiculous. The setting is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon lights, but the problem is not the environment. It is the plot and the signs of the environment that become tiring. Saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this film continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal (.. a fun voice man who has an entertaining interview on the DVD, I rented for this fiery rage of a movie) and Marilyn Burns has "key" roles as opposite members of their faction against the government, the final conclusion within a building complex resulted in the end. Neal's character Splatter uses these metal spikes that come from his metal arm to kill his victims.
