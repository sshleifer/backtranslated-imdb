This movie is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide. She is plagued by her son who refused to speak after it. Children's grief is rarely explored on film, so it is refreshing to watch a movie like Addison's wall. But because of the film's character, there is no excitement or drama. Apart from a few important emotional moments, everything in the movie is very common. The sudden end that does not solve any mysteries certainly does not help the film to be more visible. Addison's wall could have been much better, such as exploring the contents of the walls, a more intensive program to help Addison review his trauma. Instead, the film feels very unfinished and non-engaging.
