'Flood' is an excellent example of how throwing good actors and cgi on a movie will do little to compensate for a rubbish script. The basic principle is fine: What if a freak storm threatened to send the sea just above the Thames flood barriers and swallow up London so quickly that most people would probably never come out in time? It's basically the New York segment 'The Day After Tomorrow', but it shouldn't make it any less of a movie. But the script is just not there. It is only functional, flat and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet to name two make their level the best with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional numbers, like something out of an old Marvel cartoon. And it would be frankly easier to return the tide. Not that every actor gets rid of the hook - Tom Courtenay only seemed capable of just one feeling throughout the movie, but then he didn't get much of a challenge. I welcome every opportunity to see some non-Hollywood disaster flicks for a change, and I don't expect zillions of dollars spent on making ultra-realistic graphics. But there is no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has produced some of the best science fiction ever made on almost no budget. This is the kind of half-hearted B-grade fluff that the Sci-Fi channel produces, and it's hardly a goal to aim for. If you're such a fan of disaster movies, you're still tempted to do yourself a favor and see it with some friends. Even better; do not want to.
