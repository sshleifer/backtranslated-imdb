I was duped to see this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy, are they far away! Giving this 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best movies from the 1990s" is just unjustified. The big problem here is the lack of pace and a paper thin plot. It's like slapstick on Prozac. Everything rolls together predictably and loosely. The reason is weak at first - two rubbish men looking at their foxy neighbor, witnessing a murder and unraveling a disposal conspiracy - and the film never manages to go much further. There are some entertaining situations and decent plays, but it's not anywhere near enough to save this movie profile. <br /> <br /> It is simply a comedy that does not get its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?
