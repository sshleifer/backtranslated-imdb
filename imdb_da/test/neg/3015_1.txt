1) Men over the age of 25 who refer to themselves, without irony, as having "games" or being either "playing" or "balls". Gentlemen, from here it is a quick descent in the main role in your own real version of "A Night at the Roxbury". <br /> <br /> 2) Saying "The V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." itself is not bad, but when it comes to "The", it immediately becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. This is double for white people. <br /> <br /> 3) People who make TV shows based on things they don't know are not cool, and then IMDb continues as "fans" (... right ...) one of which is from "USA" (hello I too!) to bitterly offend members of their potential audience inevitably thinking their show sucks. Minus 1 extra demerit point if they use any variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bridge reason that "If you don't like the show, of course you can't be laid." <br /> <br /> 4) Canadian Hip-Hop / R & B sensation Massari ... a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day, the Massari gets the gas surface for the simple reason that his special brand of low-purely American-aping uncool and general Aqua Velva douchebaggery dovetails with the overall sensitivity of "Keys to the VIP" <br /> <br /> 5) Last but not least, "Keys to VIP" ... for all the above reasons and more.
