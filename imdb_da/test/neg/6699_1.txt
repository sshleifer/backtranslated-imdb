Being an American service member, please believe in me when I say that this movie in no way clarifies the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / airmen / marines returning from deployments. <br /> <br /> It is said .... <br /> <br /> This movie is a great steaming pile of clich√©. The action is so horrible (with the exception of the little girl) the character's backgrounds are weak and ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad I made an account with IMDb just to warn someone with a half brain away from it. Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente really should really be ashamed of this movie. If he disagrees with US foreign policy, he must write a letter to the US government, not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumental crap film.
