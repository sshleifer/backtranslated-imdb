This is just about one of the stupid things I've ever seen. Maybe not a worst movie ever contending, but if you haven't seen so many bad things, it could easily make your top ten worst list. When considering what was achieved in 1933 with the original "King Kong", you have to ask yourself why someone would bow as low as producing this debacle. Then it takes a step further and realizes that the quantum leap to "Star Wars" the following year achieved a new level of sci-fi entertainment, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now let me ask you, what would the professor (Peter Cushing) have to bring an umbrella together as a primary piece of underground research equipment to drive to the core of the earth? OK, so it was useful to ward off parrot / tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) At first, but come on. Somehow, I don't think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough had in mind when writing his stories about Pellucidar. He probably did not have Caroline Munro in mind, even as Princess Dia, probably the only redeeming factor for this whole escapade. At least there was a bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that I got a kick off; I'm always looking for one in movies like this one. It should be how the sky on the earth's core really was the underside of the earth, explaining the ethereal, pink glow. But try it as possible, the story just couldn't make me find anything interesting about Hoojah The Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less the stupid half man, half pterodactyl creatures. To rewrite the good professor - "You can't immerse me, I'm aware!"
