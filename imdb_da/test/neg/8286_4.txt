The next stop on our journey through the calendar-slasher scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All the seniors who are just filled with opportunity and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. However, if they can do it exams without having to cheat with the campus that runs around and run out of the students with their fence sword ... Yes, it all comes from a high school track star that drops dead from a clot during a race and a year later, his older sister returns from Navy for Graduation. The tram holds the blame and the cold in its shaded store class position while the girl's girlfriend still mourns his death a year later ... All these characters are leading candidates for "Serial Slasher of the Year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who did it. "Graduation Day" is fun, even though it is not spelling binding in any way, and there are not many odd attacks, but there is enough to keep you mildly entertained. Like Linnea Quigley, the music teacher screwed and got busted with a common, 30-year-old actors who played teenagers, and of course ... Rollerdisco! Maybe it loves shit! You can do much worse than "Graduation Day", kiddies ...
