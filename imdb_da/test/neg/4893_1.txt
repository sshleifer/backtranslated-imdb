This movie was ridiculous from the start. Let me save you all the time from watching this movie. A woman selling corn liquor to the locals takes her cousin or nephew and convinces her to open a cafe downstairs from her home. She does and she and cousin get dense. There is a scene later where she reads lips with him. Later, the woman finds that an old girlfriend comes back from prison and its excitement between them, leading to a down and out fist fight in the cafe. The woman's cousin / nephew is enchanted by the man. The ending was horrible, the story was horrible, and if I could waste time on this movie, I would appreciate it. A particular ship.
