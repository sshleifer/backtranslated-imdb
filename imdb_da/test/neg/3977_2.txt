I've never seen this movie alone, but like many others who have already commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really horrible 70s tv schlock. But someone saw their potential because it just turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And to the person who asked if there were any good movies made in the 70s, I would like to remind her that it was a golden age for American film with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese who first entered their own. Not to mention small things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.
