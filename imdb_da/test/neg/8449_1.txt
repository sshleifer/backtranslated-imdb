I was also duped. Here I expected all kinds of men who ate Pirahnas and what the hell do you get. <br /> <br /> An hour and a half of nothing but awkward silence with some weird guy who is not strange enough to be scary. <br /> <br /> I thought there was no way that $ 5 could be too much for a movie. <br /> <br /> I was sooo wrong. It was very hard to see it all. <br /> <br /> Don't fool yourself. It's not so good that it's bad. It's not even that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Its nothing. An hour and a half of absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> PIECE OR CRAP !!!!!!!!
