I feel really bad at reviewing this movie because I wish I only saw it as concept production. The covenant looked as if it could have been a truly original piece, but unfortunately they lose the big idea in the translation to the screen. The story follows four (five) teenagers who are descendants of the families who started the city of Ipswitch a survivor of Salem witch trials. They also happen to be part of the secret sect called "the covenant". Their power must be used sparingly, as it drains their vitality in small quantities and is very addictive. In theory, it would make a really good action-sci-fi movie ?? or at least an interesting teeny flick. <br /> <br /> But there were just too many sharp fallout that didn't allow this movie to reach its full potential. It didn't work well, the soundtrack was mediocre and we found many unnecessary synchronization issues. The biggest problem is probably the bad editing job. The movie has no continuous flow and makes a struggle to keep a mental timeline or pacing. <br /> <br /> The movie has that moment, but overall it was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> And witch 4/10
