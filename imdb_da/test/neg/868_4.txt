Lame B horror, taking care of the stupidly contemplating its object, relates to an aging old loved one who has been transformed into a being of the night by a lodge who has come to rent a room from her. When the said lodge is turned off, the mother has to go out to eat on her own and it causes some family strain and also allows some attention from the authorities. My biggest complaint is that this movie should have brought the cozy. It failed to do so even though it had some mild make and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the B movie crowd happy. I've seen worse, but I wouldn't give this a rec - 4.5 / 10.
