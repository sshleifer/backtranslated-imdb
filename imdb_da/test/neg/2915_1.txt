Remember the old Kung Fu movies we used to watch on Friday and Saturday in the evening, when our baby caretaker thought we were responsible? Well, this movie plays exactly like one of these movies. Patsy Kensit's greatest claim to fame was the interest of love for Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2", and this was one of the reasons she never made it big: she is a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Lethal Weapon 2," I thought she was sweet. Sweet enough to check out some of the other movies she had been in, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance", another great disappointment, which of course I was not impressed with either. But as attractive as she is to my eyes, my soul screamed at me to shut it down because she played another inexpensive predictable role and made it very bad. In this movie, Kensit stars as a comedienne (or not a good one) working in the france clubs (couldn't cut it in his own homeland so she makes their ears bleed) who are down on her luck but worse , the French government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa (or maybe they just got their act). But she gets married to this Casanova (Freiss), who is just as lucky and the predictability begins ... terribly! Is there any way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 out of 10 stars is over rated it!
