There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail shows a really great event in Australian military history Australia's brave defense against the cruel barbarian Japanese army. But this film fails to take into account the story of "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" or the new Guinea natives that Australians used to help them perform military operations. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behavior in this event. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what was. <br /> <br /> Also, the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in Australia's history the film it deserved. This is filmmaking at worst, with arbitrary filmography, poor scripting and dialogue, no character development and clich√© jungle warfare scenes. It fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective, except that the Japanese army was ruthless and cruel murderers of a poorly equipped and poorly trained group of Australians struggling in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The movie failed, as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience, in fact they were lost in the evening. </ br /> <br /> I'm not going to attend the usual parochial waste to say its great because it's an Australian movie. I say either do a good job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This state-funded movie is just another mistake in Australia's wealthy and spoiled rich children. I give it zero stars because it is an insult to the descendants of these really great Australians and their huge sacrifice. What a shameful waste and disrespect, and I know this review will provoke more negativity from the Movie Show crew and most reviewers, but I am right in my opinion, and that is what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM, and that includes freedom of expression and the right to express an opinion.
