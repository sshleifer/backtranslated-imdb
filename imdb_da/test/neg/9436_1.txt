You will feel that you have experienced a holiday in hell when you have sat down and watched this horrible television movie. This movie is an exercise in over-acting for situations that turned out to be more than what they are. I will not give away the plot, but when you realize why the people in this movie are running from the native man in the movie, you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!
