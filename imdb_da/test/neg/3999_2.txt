Emotionally Unsafe Tom Russo (Asbestic Field) reads his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) secret diary and is disappointed to discover that his love of life has apparently slept with every hug she meets; this shocking revelation sends poor Tom out of his rocker, and he continues to get bloody revenge on the men whom he thinks have been robbing his old lady. In my experience, really real bad movies can often be as fun as really good, and no machete-enhanced ceiling fan film should ever be considered totally worthless; but although Killing Spree very occasionally manages to entertain with his ingenuity and cheap and cheerful gore, I found that the horrible direction, horrible production values, ugly filmography, silent sound, horrible lighting, insane and boring narrative (containing a really stupid plot twist that is telegraphed from the beginning, plus a senseless zombie finale), creepy synthesizer score, inane dialogue and thoroughly amateurish act all served to make this effort by author / director Tom Ritter an almost enjoyable experience.
