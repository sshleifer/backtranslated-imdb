When I first saw Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of waste. No one is so rich and lives in a college off the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a mega popular rich girl who always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea, and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid she is. She is always perfect for everything including her perfect figure. And she's such a diet freak she talks about carbs as if she knows what they are. When she sees her friends eating chocolate, she confiscates it. And another thing that beats me is that she always chews a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. And everybody wants to do something with her, for example, in an episode that Logan guy offers $ 4,000 to make her and her friends greet everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is a far too perky freak that screams a lot. And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady. The 80s are called to have bushy hair back.Might also shave the hair hunting. This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they don't have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes, they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumb down. <br /> <br /> We hate Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best Wishes Ryan and Kara L
