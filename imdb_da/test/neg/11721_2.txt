Ahh, nuthin 'like cheesy, exploative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror ... This one star Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in the "Femali", "The Erotic House of Wax" and the family favorite "Nude Bowling Party". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties with the leading role in meaningless, soft porn exploitation flicks. The "leader of the family" actually tries to be a real moovie. A king and a tramp are trying to dismiss the said-man's tramp. They turn to a great brain's evil genius in a wheelchair and his family of moronic misfits, who use mind control to send out zombies to make his strange bidding. Said genius has a huge head, therefore the movie's clever title: it is about the extent of the film's humor. But basically it's an excuse to show the good talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Laced with some of the hardest dialogues can be bunch (what the heck are "plow oats", anycow ??), and just plain stupid, this titular thriller will be a kind of appeal to the chest customers of the Drive-In Theater, but no one else. MooCow says to avoid the devoid unless you are looking for a cheesy T&A / horror night out. : = 8P
