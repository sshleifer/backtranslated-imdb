This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I've ever seen. Although you didn't like the movie's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks', they are bound to have done a better job than this. From the moment the new teacher greets his class and they tell her, "Do not disturb us, we are all losers," you can see everything that comes twenty miles away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the spunky teacher, we have a group of what must be endearingly bratty kids (they are brats, yes, but not so endearing), a slow little town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc. ., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo as the new teacher shows something similar. I have never cared much for Steve Guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff does not change things. Jay O. Sanders is an accomplished actor, but his character, the rival trainer, leaves him nothing to work with. Let's hope writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan comes up with something better next time out.
