On my continued quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It's fun through and through, especially if you don't know (like we don't) it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I will not bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone is complaining about the terrible snowstorm that came (it corresponds to the signs that just scream "FORESHADOWING!" by the camera and waving in their arms), and in some unequal destiny there is a blizzard. I think budget problems. <br /> <br /> Add it to a magic front door that opens or closes depending on the scary effect the director will create and the power cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with plenty of soap. I will admit it; I had trouble breathing on points. The only real decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much more fun now that I know. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end where it is obvious that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled upon her and a female friend ended up and then friend enters a train or something is probably the Funniest psycho killer origin ever raised by the amazing use of blur and stock footage. I am glad that all of the slaughterers' friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was needed. <br /> <br /> Go, don't go to get this and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should get a price for all of this if they just weren't stuck in the terrible snow ...
