I fully understand why this movie was made. The sound of the lamb was an incredible movie - a cruel thriller with a great story and high jump factor .... <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reproduce his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this horrible and unsatisfactory movie. <br /> <br /> There is no way to destroy the movie anymore than to see it, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DO NOT READ. The movie is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a no-problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to set your watch and leave the theater exactly two hours in the movie, for until that time it's a very interesting thriller. The genius between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performance with the other characters is pretty good. But literally on the two-hour field, the film breaks down to nothing, but a cheesy D-grade horror flick ... it's sick and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of shooting time and threw an end to a day of filming. <br /> <br /> Initial buzz about Thomas Harris' book's unsatisfactory and bizarre ending senior director Ridley Scott to order a re-write ... and honestly having seen the movie AND read the book's finale, I don't know what is worse. <br /> <br /> Please - do not save your money OR time on this movie unless you are ready to leave EXACTLY at 2 hours because this is the only way you will feel satisfied with the saga Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... continues the mystery that made the first movie, and the wait for this one, so great.
