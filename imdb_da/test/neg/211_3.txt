After seeing this for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. It's a clich√© movie with a stupid installation. I'm a big fan of thief movies, but this one doesn't deliver anything new smart or special. It's about an insider heist gone bad because the "hot head-bad guy" shoots a bum, and of course the "do goody-bad guy" goes on a moral ride. The reason it is stupid and not credible is. When you've already gone so far to kill a bum, why not just kill one guy standing between you and 43 million. They got 45 minutes to push the money and scenes a robbery nobody in there would have hesitated to shoot Mr "Do goody" and in this case he is a guy they knew for a few days .... All and everything I leaned on to quickly forward from the middle of it, but I knocked it out and boy do I regret it
