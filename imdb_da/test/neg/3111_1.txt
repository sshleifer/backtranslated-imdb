I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 on a local flea market. I thought that with the cast gift in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe & Mario Van Peebles is all OK), it would be pretty good. Boy, was I wrong. This movie annoyed hell out of me. Almost every scene draws too long. The scene where Rob Lowe sees this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is not a picnic either. My guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of movie, so they did everything last 3 times longer. Conclusion: The current 1.9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To see some better movies made by this instructor, see 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
