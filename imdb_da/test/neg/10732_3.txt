A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad aprons (afro wig on a white guy?) Cruises around his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer quite easy by just hanging out at the local pool and looking for someone who looks weird (again the afropermen comes to the game). Tracking the murderer to his home, DeCarlo decides to create a risky stitch involving a female police psychologist. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes before being caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and inexpensive serial killer flick. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to pace a movie or even make it exciting. He knows how to show many close-ups of the killer who twists his hands himself! The only thing that really goes for it is the captured 70's atmosphere (look out for the bathroom wallpaper). Well, that and a downward end. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD has lots of good stuff, though an audio comment from Hoenack and Karl, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternative opening.
