This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. It is clear from the outset that Steve Gutenburg took this role seriously .... the other principles went through their lines. I think they got a whiff of how much it stank early and they went through the movements of their pay slips. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but was spared sharing space on the screen with any of the principles for the final scene, where it was like an actor who went on a high school scene, that's how defined the contrast was . Some actors do not look good scruffy. Some actors should not get rid of a lot. These two statements apply to the "Police Academy" Steve. His scruffy look translates to bum and indigent and his bulking up makes him look potato not lumpy buff. Couple it with one of the worst scripting dialogues in Hollywood history and you have BAD movies. I can only guess that all the principles really need the money for rebuilding or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys to print it. I would love to know the back story of this disaster.
