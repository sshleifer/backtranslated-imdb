Why is it that Canada can prove decent for good movies in every genre, other than action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just couldn't change the channel, it's pure stupidity sapped my willpower. It is true to say that the cast IMDb "credits" with this monstrosity seemingly never worked again. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, poor writing, bad story, bad music, bad hair, poor filmography. It just goes over and over again. The movie really has nothing to recommend it. If you're looking for bad action movies to enjoy laughing, there's a ton of other movies that don't require you to score your retinas afterwards. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie didn't make the government money for funding, otherwise I never pay taxes again.
