I watched this short movie on the DVD for Ridley Scott's movie, The Duellists. There was no introduction by Scott before the movie, it just started up. <br /> <br /> Boy and a bike are hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it has no resemblance. The movie shows a boy played by Tony Scott, riding a bike. Guess what? It's pretty much everything that happens. The boy rides around and falls over and over with a meaningless, confusing dialogue. The movie was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by Ridley Scott, I expected some great movie pictures or visually striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This movie is not even good at first action. However, I recommend that any fan of Ridley Scott should check it at least once.
