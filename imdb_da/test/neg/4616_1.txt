I had never gone out of a movie before this one. I had entertained the idea a few times, but this time I did it, snuck to see the end of another movie but had to come back and see the end of Rage while waiting for my friends. They told me I didn't miss much while I was away too. I was generally offended by the whole movie, in such a way that I can't even describe it. My gut instinct told me to get out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. The plot centered on the cruel acts of some objectionable teenagers against vulnerable and restless others. There was no light beam, no resonance or the like as contrast. I found out that even the "good guys" in the movie did nothing to me, were stupid, stupid, whiney, or just ineffective. The repeated graphic suicide pictures were too exaggerated, unnecessary and disgusting. (Not in a "widespread" way, but more in the portrayal of respect for the way of humanity). And besides the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, they had other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) potential but became just annoying sometimes. I am someone who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Normally, I can find some good things to counteract the not-so-good movie. I'm not saying this movie didn't have any good, but I say whatever it may have been, I can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me angry. I'm sorry, too. Perhaps the best parts were the clips of the classic original.
