This is an incredibly standard western that contains some bad plays, boring history and stupid action. Perhaps the biggest problem is how amazing this movie is. It has all the usual clich√©s, even a bar battle and the movie really has no surprises in it. It makes it a boring and weak western look, not least because it is so poorly made. It is of course a small production, and the film looks like it was shot for 30 days. The management and editing can be called bad, and all the action sequences shown in the movie are incredibly stupid. It may be almost a little humorous to see for all the wrong reasons. It's also not that interesting. It is a beautiful friendly western (so also no blood), where for some strange reason it seems to be against the younger brothers who in this movie are portrayed as good and very kind guys. The story becomes silvery and sillies as it leads towards its end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Young gang, of which the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part. Of course, they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie. It was just custom for an early 40's to have sympathetic man characters in it. It wasn't really before Spagethi-Western age really that the protagonists really became rotten criminals. Strangely enough, approaching has always been better than the early Westerns, where the protagonist is on the good side of the law. What makes this movie is the fact that it was shot in color. This was something quite unique for a '40's western and still gives the movie something extra. You may wonder why they shot this western in full color. The movie is still in the style of a black and white early West after all, and I actually think this movie would have been a little more credible if it was done in black and white instead. <br /> <br /> You could easily do without this Western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
