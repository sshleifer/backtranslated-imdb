Not only does the VHS and DVD coverage (at least in Europe) show a scene that has nothing to do with the movie's real plot, but the play is so bad that the movie is crying to be fun. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends, and you want some laughs about a movie that should be serious, see Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who will teach you to fight evil with empty cardboard boxes ! Shame on Dennis Hopper, following Travolta's example by staring at his very own "battlefield land". For those who want to see a good movie that the earth is being destroyed by a terrible force, do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and see "Armageddon" for his 20th time!
