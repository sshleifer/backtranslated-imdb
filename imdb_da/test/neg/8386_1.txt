I watched this movie last night, though I wanted to rent a scarecrow / scary movie from blockbusters and I got it out here. The opening scenes were so long wrapped, the conversations between characters didn't seem to look anywhere. The story seemed to be so bad for me, she gave him HIV, and then she goes to meet someone else, but she is killed by the man she infected (I think she might have done it for a long time to different people) So when he dumps the body, it just happened to be the man she was supposed to meet, was in the woods and saw him dump the body. Then he chased them (had he ever finished burying the body?) And they came into a car and somehow found them from a different direction they came from and killed the block. <br /> <br /> I think the cut head was the only good thing in the movie as it was quite realistic. and then when the woman ran, she fell in front of him so he could stick her with a spade !! AND THAT END !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, it was the most meaningless movie I've ever seen ... please steer it well, it's just so badly made, I figured only 5 different people in it, and the scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they only swear in it and that is it !! That's it from me ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
