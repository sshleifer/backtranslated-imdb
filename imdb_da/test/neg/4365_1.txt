some will argue that this is better primarily because of the action; But it is actually far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> The source from which all problems stem from history. Apart from one of those being shot, pointing sharply with a shotgun in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; And that includes asking an evil spirit for help. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with a voodoo past, is willing to call Killjoy as long as Nic can "hook her up". The action, while improving, is still angry. These people could not convey emotions out of a paper bag. The script also doesn't help them. Stupid lines, and I can only assume no direction from the director. This script was read as Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them while walking. <br /> <br /> while this movie (if you can call it that in its 80 min driving time (fortunately)) might be just more fun than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to see. 10.1.
