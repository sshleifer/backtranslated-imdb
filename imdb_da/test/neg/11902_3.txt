This is a bad movie, as its central message is very confused, and the plot looks like it was the result of the merging of several scripts. As a result, it often makes no sense at all, and it is certainly not a movie, Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud to do so. However, the movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of "Pre-Code" movies because it has an incredibly sleazy plot that strongly says that fine girls set off - even if they are not married and even if their partner is !! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker helping troops on their way to Europe for WWI. In the process she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot), who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She gets pregnant, and he goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne will not have him back when she realizes that he is not worth it, but later she dies children at birth. While all these highly controversial plural elements are being used, they are always highlighted - almost as they wanted the adults in the audience to know, but hoped that if they put it or filmed it properly, children in the audience would be clueless (movies was not rated and children can participate in any movie at any time. Surprisingly, this whole plot ends with a stillborn baby and Cabot approx. 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or referred to. It was as if they were filming part of a movie and leaving it - sticking it to another movie. In this second phase of the movie, Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins to work at a woman's prison (though we actually never really see her doing anything there). What we see are countless terrible scenes of serious abuse and torture that were probably designed to titrate. And as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and become a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> But then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the woman's prison reform business goes by the way. Dunne meets with a judge (Walter Huston) who is married, but desperately wants her. Now in the whole movie, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl - even though she had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less fooled into it). But now, single Irene, a tireless reformer and good lady, is starting to sleep with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are alienated and only married in name, but she never thinks about whether it is true, and with her insurance, her clothes fly away and they are in the baby! BUT, while she is pregnant with her love child, he is accused of being a crooked judge. He assures her that he is innocent, but he is doomed and it certainly sounds like he is a scoundrel - using internal information from people who have come for his bench to collect a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the movie, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him free and promises to wait with the child until Huston is released. The movie ends then. <br /> <br /> So we basically have three separate movies AND a bizarre early 30's idea of ​​what a nice girl should be. I gathered that she should be a strong mind working girl who immediately becomes an idiot in her personal relationship! This really regrets all the positives of Dundee's character, and it is really hard to imagine anyone likes the movie. A strong female lawyer can easily be offended by how weak and needy she was, and religious people could see her as complete immoral or at least moral suspicion! With a decent rewrite, this could have been a good movie or at least interesting as a creepy and fun movie, but it couldn't do whatever it wanted to be and was just another boring Pre-Code movie.
