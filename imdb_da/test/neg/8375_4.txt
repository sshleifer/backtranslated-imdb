I realize that the line on my summary is not too polite. <br /> <br /> This film written and directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a dog in this puppy of a movie. He is nice. The film opened in 2 US theaters at the end of April 2007, for a week and broke the entire $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007. <br /> <br /> We could only take about 40 minutes before we turned off the DVD. <br /> <br /> It was the type of movie that played on the lower half of the double bill. You saw the main movie and the figure lets you see how this is, You might have gone out before we closed it. <br /> <br /> The 3 actors and young ladies in the movie have all made and earned better than this. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10
