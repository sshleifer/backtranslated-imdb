Yes, stupid is the word for this actress. I know many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty and boring to see with her bleached hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. See her walk away in the jeans showing a pretty big ass. Her buttocks spread over her shoulders. What are you telling it? With regard to the leading man played by beautiful Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly thrown. A charm. But he and Lancaster just didn't match. She was out of the way to this great guy. Good play by Susan Glover as sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was okay. But film director Philippe Gagnon wasted too much on Lancaster. After a while, you got tired of looking at her and looking at her boring action. And which bitch of a wife she was. Snooping on her husband, being disgusting to him and just a plain spoiled brat. Was happy to see her hit with the gun. I thought it might be the end of her. But unfortunately the script tells us otherwise. After torturing myself and looking at this loser again, I still came up with the same criticism. Lancaster is boring to see. This time around her hair, people. Her hair constantly in her face, constantly throwing it back, became annoying. I question the author, Alexandra Komisaruk's reason why a well-known wealthy man like Philippe could even suffer with a bimbo like Allison. Since there were so many attractive intelligent women, with the class to choose. He doesn't choose anything. Is this Rochester / Jane Eyre case? Oh yes, it's just a matter of taste, I think. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, people.
