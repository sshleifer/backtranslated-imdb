Killing, boring and a total waste of my time. The reason is incomprehensible (do not think too much).

There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a free sex scene, etc. The only thing that got my attention was that it takes place after a war between the US and Iraq, as on one or the other. other way goes into nuclear power. ..hmmm. Is Roger Corman Mental? Let us hope that "Iraq" was only a fortunate choice for Corman and that the rest of its scenario does not come true. <br /> <br />
