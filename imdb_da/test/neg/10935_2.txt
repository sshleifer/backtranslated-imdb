It is amazing that something like this could find its way to the public. I knew it was Uwe Boll and I found it in Copenhagen in a $ 2 store (still pretty steep, considering), but morbid curiosity made me see this and: <br /> <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure this is a rip-off of seven, the silence of the lambs and American psycho, all rolled into one, with dialogue that might have been written by preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the protagonist, and he is so bizarre and scary that almost everyone wants to know he must be the crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good policeman" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a homemade dinner, and what does she get for her problems? I will let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" policeman who runs a VW Bug, new style, that is, with a siren on it. A VW Bug ... who will hit fear in criminal hearts when they see it coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks up with her fiance, but she still has a "not engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". Imagine everyone's surprise he turns out (of course he was invited) and they are all shot. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact, it should have been # 1, really. The killer in this is known as "The Monkey Maker". This is undoubtedly the stupid killer name anyone could have gotten in a million years. Probably it has something to do with "see no evil, do not hear evil, talk no evil" says complete with monkeys. It is possible that monkeys had something to do with the script as well. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yes, and there's a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the movie. There is bad disco music, I mean really bad, and a chain-link fenced cage with, unmanageable gang members beating crap apart with baseball bats? So it looked. And of course it's just the tip of the iceberg, the really cool stuff (?!) Continuing in the basement, where some dubious "actor" speaks some women to sign a confession before she gets shot, this creature I guess a snus movie? Not sure how this fits in with the rest of the movie, and Boll wasn't enough either, so if he wasn't worried then I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of non-content that makes you feel like you're seeing something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe that is a bit like ours, but where things are just enough away where they don't work right. You have entered "Ball Zone". Exit as soon as possible and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
