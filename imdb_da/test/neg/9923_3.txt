Very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. The film's only hope of keeping the audience interested is at regular intervals that the free nudity is thrown in. Ellen Barkin is mistaken and her appearance doesn't stop when she's on the screen with the much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie was about.
