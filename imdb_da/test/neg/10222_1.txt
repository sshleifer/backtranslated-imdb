Now I am a big animation fan - love Svankmeyer and am usually in all applications of stop motion, so I had great hopes on this. Then I came to IMDb and was stopped --- I'm always really suspicious of movies with a bimodal distribution of voices on IMDb. Here we have another --- a bunch of 10's (shill someone) and saw some real lows. I am also suspicious of the 10s with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Sure there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my worries, I saw this movie and have to sit with them. The stop motion animation was okay, but the plots were banal and generally it seemed amateurish. Treat yourself to the right deal, get some Svankmeyer and let it run on the shelf as well.
