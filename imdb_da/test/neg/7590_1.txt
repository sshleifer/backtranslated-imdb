This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lose that daughter? with the poltergeist overtone rip off? Just push it over the edge with stupidity. I saw it at the show hours, so it still had cheese soft-core porn scenes in it. I must say it made me laugh my ass. The 3d effects of the 80's were very out of place. Including an invisible cat and a rotating vortex. Wow I wonder if the people who did this actually feel carried out in life. The actor who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyway. Her cries could be used as a torture unit in hell for more than retired Nazis. Anyways thanks for showtime for super crappy horror movies. I will always enjoy the time I saw the greatest waist of time and money I have ever seen.
