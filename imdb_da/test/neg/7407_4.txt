* This comment may technically include "spoilers", but it certainly does not include surprises. <br /> <br /> My cousin and I rented this today hoping to get a good laugh for a typical amateur, sorry for a horror movie. Unfortunately, we didn't laugh too many and we didn't get too scared. <br /> <br /> Plot outline: An airplane containing a business manager's daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes into an area where our freaky friend lives, so the company manager brings together a team of personalities instead of skilled hunters to restore . <br /> <br /> For the first 3/4 the movie, it gets pretty boring. It mostly consists of shots from Big Foot lurking in the trees, with party members occasionally hearing him, and delivering it as nothing. We also see several pictures of the party through Big Foot's point of view, and he obviously sees in thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To create the plot, we need to see sequences from the group around the campfire and talk about opportunities to justify the existence and actions of sasquatches. "Maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming". Certainly, we'll see later, he can. "There are many unknown countries that the sasquat can live in. Perhaps this is one of those that was overestimated". And of course it is. "Maybe Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members". And surely that is the case. Along with these scenes, there are a couple of "Oh my god, it's sasquatch, just wait for it!" scenes, and unfortunately they are among the scary. <br /> <br /> Finally, people are starting to die. Well, at least 2 people. Furthermore, the parents' bodies are discovered. The death scene is rather paralyzed. It mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing Sasquatch grabbing them and then cutting to another scene, but first we are treated with some terrible screams of camera. <br /> <br /> Finally we come to see the protagonist's last showdown with the monster. I must admit I found it quite exciting while it lasted. But unfortunately, it is rather short-lived and after we are treated to an end that makes half an effort to seem cryptic. Then, some final text with a rather dull conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can't say I recommend this movie. It's not bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's certainly not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie. Just don't bother with that.
