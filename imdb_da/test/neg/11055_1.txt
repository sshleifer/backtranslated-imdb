SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie shot on video. It has useful action, poor lighting, a weak story and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The reason is that a college student is being pressured to participate in a cult of his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a fun shot in that group if it was not a stupid manuscript and the fairness of the production. The Monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes you feel like you are watching a home video or a public service message. I think everyone who sees this agrees that movies should be recorded on movies.
