The only reason why there is a question mark in brackets is NOT because I haven't seen every movie released in 2001 so far. This is because this film was made only partially in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur film, Carnosaur 1-3. I have a confession to make. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's "Aliens", it's not even fun. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the seats, I liked movies, I liked how they borrowed from "Aliens". It is a bit ironic that at one point Cameron was an immersion of Cormans, with films like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I own the Carnosaur trilogy on DVD, and the first thing I can think of is that it has moments. The third thing I can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it. <br /> <br /> Now we have "Raptor" which doesn't continue that series. Instead, it lends UNIT's scenes from Carnosaur Trilogy and builds a movie around it. And somehow Roger Corman could get Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen do it. Now I do not say that Roberts or Bernsen have any kind of career high. But they were both at one point what could be called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Sure, actors react to effects they won't even see during movie recording all the time. Here, however, they respond to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sheriff whose costume was modeled directly after a sign in "Carnosaur 1." Apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old "Carnosaur" dinosaur models. Apparently, after this interview, Corman decided he wouldn't even do it. And it's not that he couldn't find an FX crew member to do it. The manuscript for this was clearly written, bearing in mind that history was to be built on existing stocks. <br /> <br /> Don't compare this with Ed Wood. Ed did better than this. At least, he used only stock footage of Bela once in a movie. There are ways to incorporate stock footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes this wrinkled technique to a new layer. Although you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species," stay away from "Raptor".
