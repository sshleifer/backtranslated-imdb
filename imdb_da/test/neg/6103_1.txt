<br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed by a large audience with giggle fits. <br /> <br /> Very often, the characters in KADOSH are seen and nothing stares at nothing. Very intense unhappy faces, very thoughtful, very serious. In these moments, there is very loud sounding music to double that the viewer realizes that the scene seen is not about fun and games. The more entertaining parts of this movie come in between the many nourishing stares. We learn that the women in the KADOSH community have two duties. One is to raise as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The other is to be hired to free their husbands from having to work. What do these men do with their good free time? They ask. And we learn that at home they pray loudly: "I thank you for not creating me as a woman." And at their place of worship, they ask to have functional male genitals. <br /> <br /> Along with the prayer, there are many scenes of frenzied antics, screaming and endless headbones and bodies that rock back and forth, and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre (or simple but equally strange ) ritualistic activities. The cream of the unintentional comedy comes from sex. The image of a hot and bothered man who actively exchanges body fluids with his wife in bed while trying to keep his dress from falling off the scalp is unforgettable! <br /> <br /> Every sex scene is fun, but one that stands out is when a man rubs his face against his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis) feet. Oh yes, we finally go into the sensuality country ... but no! The rubbing of the feet stops before something happens, and the man begins his autistic look on his head and body tissue until the stage ends! <br /> <br /> There are three attractive females in nearby outfits, but KADOSH has absolutely no nudity. Technically, there are some interesting pictures and pleasant uses of the light and colors of the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of the situation of being an unclean woman unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured at the rate at which a man can quote a sentence from old writings, I suggest Barbra Streisand's YENTL. <br /> <br />
