* This review may contain spools ... or maybe not. The warning is the same for everyone * <br /> <br /> Sing it. Just as I thought the SCIFI Channel had used all its ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us this. In fact, the plot itself is what we have not seen in movies such as snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, etc. This means that a monster / animal / some kind of threat lurks in a close environment that threatens a bunch of people. In this case, a stranger is in a train. Wow. I must say that when I first saw this thing on cable, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI movie had prepared me for this; It was so incredibly pathetic I couldn't believe it! The actors are all a lot of stereotypical genres. But since they are not so famous (at least), I don't expect much from them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called "special effects", horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards. The model / toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model / toy helicopter, bigger than a train wagon), the meteor comes HORIZONTALLY from the room, 'baby' alien (a sock doll and I ain't the kiddin '), the permanent foreigners who looked rather ugly ... while they were static; when they began to move, it was terrible, the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the exploding helicopter! How many fat gas was the thing that bore?), the mad mathematics was used (they couldn't even solve a school problem Just!) ... And I don't want to talk about the doomsday-like end, then I didn't know how to laugh or to start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> Having a good laugh alone or with friends is an ideal movie. But be warned; it is so ridiculous on so many levels ... and you need a lot of mass suspension of disbelief ...
