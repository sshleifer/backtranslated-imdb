Since I am from Norway (one of the ten largest or the world's richest countries), it was very fun to see how we use trucks from the 50s and live in medieval cabins. And since we have very strict laws on small arms, it was fun to see how many weapons were actually in Norway during the five minutes that were shot there. Mr. Direct-to-video has even managed to bring its silencer at short notice, so he must have powerful friends in the customs. <br /> <br /> At least you have to do something before going to an "exotic" country dudes - you can hurt the feel of old fans. <br /> <br /> Swear old fan with evil emotions.
