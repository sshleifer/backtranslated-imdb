Calling a movie boring is not something I would normally count as a valid criticism. But when a movie is crisp made of spare parts from other films that were not so good at first, and it is slow as molasses without real payout, I find it reasonable to call a spade a spade. And The Ghost is a very boring movie. A movie that is about as original as its name The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia haunted by a ghost holding the secret to her past. Only, it is much more complicated and less interesting than one would think. The plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the image, and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. It seems that no one, including writer and director, has any idea what hell is going on at any time. Instead, they chose to do what largely corresponds to the cinematic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series and a smash of Pulse for good measure. Doing worse, half dozen leads every dress and read their lines equally, making them impossible to tell each other. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to understand about this movie. The story is not so well thought out. Amnesia gimmick is lazy. Mysterious element is not involved and handled with little grace. The characters never emit anything, all information is just passed through the lead that remembers her past when it is practical for the plot. <br /> <br /> The camera, full of reflections and shots of water, at least tries to add to the subtitle, a thematic link with the Amnesia, and the final twist (which I won't reveal) is nice, but often overwhelmed. Even the point feels borrowed and clich√©. Worst of all, the encouraging act of the curse is not very interesting, and the last twist is predictable and lame. "Wait, you think a character that has 15 minute screen time but seemed to have nothing to do with the plot comes back last? No!" Target groups are too skilled at this kind of tripe. Anyone who has seen some of the movies that this rip off will find very little to keep them awake with this feature. I used to think that Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel of this kind of crap (remake of his grudge film no less than 5 times), but even his second movement works like Reincarnation, a movie I couldn't even bring myself to finish , miles before this. <br /> <br /> For more reviews visit www.collider.com
