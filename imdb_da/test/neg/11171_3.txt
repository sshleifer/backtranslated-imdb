It is really sad to see a unique director like Deodato, who delivers such a second class giallo like this. This movie was so horrible that it effectively put an end to his movie career. The door is lying, this is no "erotic thriller", hell in the movie's 97 minute playtime, Charlotte Lewis hardly shows us a nipple! I thought it would come when William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character is being beaten a bit abruptly and paralyzed. This movie fails in just about every single way. Claudio Simonetti's music is a little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts attacking by phones. (?) At the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the last 90 minutes of hell, they went through and the maid laughs as the sick the evil spirits of another, Lewis's ex-girlfriend. What?!? This movie did a little for me besides anger me .... and carried me half to death. For true 80's Deodato fun, see BARBARIENER or ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let this mess up the video store shelf. Argento could do a better giallo than this!
