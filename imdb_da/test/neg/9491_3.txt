I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is really beautiful and hearkens back to 20 and 30's architecture like Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it still exists. As for the film itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was nominated for an Oscar herself. This must have been a period when she liked her graduates. It would really have been interesting to get a true impression from Wyman and the other actors in this movie about the script. The script of this movie, like the latest Kevin Costner movie with a bottle message, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, was able to get the most out of his appearance and did not get credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.
