Don't be fooled by the 'prices' and the comment below. This is just a bad movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to see. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic view of this. Those in the rest of the movie seem to be the character's head somewhere else. His feelings do not match the things that happen in the movie. The stuff he says as a voice-over doesn't add anything to the movie. It just makes Zeus an even more spineless character with the head in the clouds. The story and the film were put together with a total lack of imagination. All parts of the film were badly stolen from other modern directors. Let us hope that Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
