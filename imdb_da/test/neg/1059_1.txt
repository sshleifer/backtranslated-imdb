Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and manufacturers believe we are all idiots. If not, how do we understand this: <br /> <br /> American pilots leave on Mig-29s. Suddenly all aircraft turn to F-16s. Have a magic! After an act ... Migs lands. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that F-16s had Israeli markings? <br /> <br /> Another magic: blatantly unarmed L-39 trainer bombs enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: while whole movies are located in Europe, we can see a desert in almost every flying scene. <br /> <br /> Maybe the instructor hit all his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look terrible as pilots are bombarded with molotovs. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, this is a movie. I was going to write about his story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is a special story in this movie. And it is terrible too.
