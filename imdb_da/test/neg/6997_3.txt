With such a promising cast and a director I have heard good things about, I was totally disappointed with this movie. It began with signs of a great epic gangster story and turned into a completely confused mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes. (And yes, I saw in full length version). I love Robert DeNiro, and as usual he did a fine job, but in all his other gangster movies, no matter how many he kills, I always had respect for his character, but in this movie he was low-dust drug abusers, rape without care for anyone than himself. Also James Woods, another fine actor, had some ridiculous scenes written to him. I thought they share where Robert DeNiro called him crazy, and he turned out, got out of the left field, and in the end, the authors just shed this random comment on how his father died in an emergency house, and therefore James Woods did not as being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie. We also never find out who the men are at the beginning trying to kill noodles, and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the authors put together five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the story when the characters were young children. The story went smoothly in this part of the movie, and the kids did a great play. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie and I can't see how anyone can even compare this with Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I'm sorry I wasted four hours in my life and looked at this movie
