If you want to have a character in a movie, have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame the sign of later life, the only thing that an audience would see as shameful was the bestiality and now it has been done. Judging by some of the other comments, even that failed. I can't remember a funny scene, though I have to admit I had to turn it off before it was finished. I saw part of the director's comment and it seems that he was so surprised as everyone that the movie did well. If you want the same feeling, you get from this movie, but only cheaper, keep your head in a pile of fertilizer and breathe deeply.
