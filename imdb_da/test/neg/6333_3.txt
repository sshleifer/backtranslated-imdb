The unpleasant "home invasion" genre can be traced back to Wes Craven's early sleaest "last house on the left" with such unpleasant off-shoots as "I Spit On Your Grave", "Wrong Way" and "The Visitors" soon after in the footsteps of the film. Here, in this early 80s Italian offer, the same plot is withdrawn, as the twist is that it is put on a continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? Starts surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse, as the sex scenes begin to take precedence over the more serious action and excitement. <br /> <br /> David, Phil, and Ernie, three rich youths who flew in terrorism and humiliated others, control a transcontinental expression in Italy. The train is filled with other passengers, including the prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) who drives the train often and has agreed with one of the carriers to act as a kind of pimp and persuade the male passengers to participate in their money for one night of passion in his bedroom. The three cranes quickly set up to disturb the passengers with their aggressive, intoxicated behavior, but it becomes more serious when they take control of an entire car on the term and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Almost soon they are raised in their temporary control. a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the young in a cramped room; Juliette himself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault; and later the honorable trio force the male passengers to play a cube to determine who will rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept is doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of The men who are forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems to be willing to fight back is a judge escorted to Germany, but what hope does a man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto comes to a decent start. Various exciting characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums have proven to have a real disturbing impact on travelers. Although the story is clearly the utilization rate, the opening scene is carefully built up, and the film seems to rise above the usual gut level of its genre. Things fall apart under a horrid scene, where Kerova is the sex sandwich in a toilet room of two of the farmers. The play is gloatingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to be creating sympathy for the victim or the hatred of the perpetrators ?? Instead, we are asked to be turned on. This is sensationalism at worst. Further humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over the actions of oral sex and female genitals. A sequence of the 16-year-old girl's toes on the edge of hard core and feels particularly "wrong". At the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it is easy to forget that it was meant as a thriller, for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than excitement. Lovers of sleaze will save in it; others may look elsewhere.
