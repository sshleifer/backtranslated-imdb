Separated by fans for its exceptionally charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, easy-to-use movie-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in the formula's favor with his new uprising of a movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. After the hunt for Ichabod Crane ?? played by Johnny Depp, this boring movie delivers only shining endpoint ?? In the heart of the mystery of a city's seemingly random and cruel murder of a fabulous headless rider, history plays as if intentionally trying to be contradictory predictable. The impression as a children's bedtime story is humdrum character introduction twisted with envisioned exciting, non-engaging chase scenes that, with undeveloped characters flying for their lives, produce about as much scare and excitement as The Nightmare Before Christmas. Throw in an endless bundle of old trees for mood and a witty, big-bustled blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton even have a movie that takes the old legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do it as a Disney movie without charm or imprisonment. Dialogue was choppy and ridiculous, cut heads were superfluous, and there were probably plot-revealing monologues to scare them as James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most coveted filmmaker in Hollywood today, the wonderful play of Depp and Burton's astonishing naming, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over.
