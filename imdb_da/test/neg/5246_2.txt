Christopher Lambert attracted me to this movie. What a waste! The reason has more holes than my string western special effects were not very good, it did not take much to figure out who the creation's mother was and the creation owed more than a small debt to the Predator. Anti-climatic this movie could have been made a whole lot better. However, it raises an interesting point though. When should Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore out there just waiting to be extracted?
