Anyone who fights with monsters can watch out for him to become a monster. And if you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is from Nietzsche's aphorism 146 from "Beyond Good and Evil". And that's what you find at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see the whole movie, you will doubt whether it was the message that Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass. When the scenes cut off one by one, rather violent and sometimes puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget Nietzsche's quote and otherwise think. To deal with few people, you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who want the permission to kill someone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police that we are allowed to believe). <br /> <br /> When TADA was lifted and the government wanted to pass on recent and even more draconian laws, RGV's "Satya" did the necessary brain surgery without blood transfusion to the multiplex growing thinking city, whose views relate to a democratic country like India. . In one year, MCOCA was passed. <br /> <br /> When real life meets specialist Daya Nayak became a monster on the road to fight them and was self-reserved by MCOCA, "Aab thanks Chhappan" was pronounced "false" impression among the people about this.

Only praise and hope that they will get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station, who will solve all problems and thus only let milk and butter flow everywhere. Blood? You can ignore. <br /> <br /> Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India must also attack Pakistan". This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you do not give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not. Therefore, this game is of passion for hatred.
