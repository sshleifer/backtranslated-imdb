Why was this not voted for Best Picture of 1998? This should be the best movie ever. It does something that Citzen Kane looks like a complete villain, come on, Citzen Kane wasn't even in color! I love this movie, it must be the best movie I've ever put on money. I'm still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give it, I'll give it 20!
