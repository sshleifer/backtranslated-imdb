This movie easily falls into the category of ridiculous, if not over, that it is actually offensive. I mean in what alternative universe did the filmmakers and the studio think that this movie would play? From the beginning to the end, we bombarded with quaid's overactive and ridiculous facial expressions that lie on "In a loose cannon", seems a little thick. Another pick point I had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in a scene where Lewis plays in a bar before he makes it big. It is over the top, just totally absurd, that all citizens in the city are apparently part of. Then Lewis begins to play his rendition of "A Lot of Shakes" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and starts dancing wildly as if it were the most normal thing in the world. These kinds of scenes, many of which are accompanied by the lack of depth in any of the characters, led me to actual laughter. So all in all, this movie is not worth watching for anyone who is not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors' decisions for an hour and a half.
