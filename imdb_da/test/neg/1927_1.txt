I watched this movie to see the direction that one of the most promising young talents in film went. Unfortunately, Leelee Sobieski with this movie has chosen a path that is not only well-worn but completely free of any meaningful destination. This movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen, push you on the shoulder and ask politely if it can have your heartbeat so it can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left to feel the love displayed on the screen. Under the emotional climax of this movie, I laughed. Hot. To save you time and money, I suggest, instead of watching this movie, you have a Karosirup and Velveeta meal. It's all about the same thing.
