Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not think that a great and sparkling career should lie in front of the director of this monstrous and boring piece of umbilical stirring. While it is good to see a British director trying to break out of the Convention's boundaries, AKA's only requirement for innovative fame is the news of the triple screen. First, you think this can turn out to be an interesting entity, but the only real contribution to the movie is to test your vision and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional film makes it no more revealing or complex. If you can forget about the triple screen (as given is very hard to do) then you have to handle the unintentional hilarious script. The audience is turned to submission by chiche about the chiche of the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and downstairs. In summary: The Emperor's new clothes. And also a pretty bad outfit.
