Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al. - succeed in surviving all the war floats where they are superior? I think I've found out. The enemies always miss and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a gun and ejected half a dozen weights shooting at him from a few yards away. One of the tongues has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him, and Seagal would still show up with his ponytail intact. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to mano a mano battle - forget it. The Evildos may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt objects, but Seagal, with its skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them aside with a couple of redundant strokes. Not only is he master of these outre skills, but his physical strength is the Herculean. More than once he snaps a person's long legs as easily as we would break a toothpick. One breaks a guy's SPINE over the knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I get into the film's spirit here because Seagal uses the line "I tell you something" several times with, "What does that mean?") These guys deserve complete extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook. They are all black, talking with incomprehensible Jah-MAY-can accents, wearing dreadlocks that look hard on a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and here is the worst part. They are non-Christians. It is true. They practice voodoo. In fact, the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting feature of the movie. They got the ritual's ingredients pretty good - cigar smoke, room spitting, the sacrificial chicken. They only excluded the possession dance, where the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read Metraux on voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot follows the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is made here to a friend of Seagal's. What was done with John Wayne as he stuck between trucks in "McQ" is made here to Seagal himself. In the movie's very open opening, when Seagal writes a short talk about having seen too much pointless violence in his DEA career, he is now happily retired, and when we are introduced to his friends and family, I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could find out which ones would be terribly murdered or mistreated to generate their revenge. <br /> <br /> The action does not require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican policeman played by Tom Wright, is really pretty good. Wright has great reach. Here he is a federation of dubious allegiance, a little scary. But in "Pentagon Wars" he has a cartoon that he teaches perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans never flew as a movie curtain. I don't know why exactly. It's a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica stay for Montego Bay. But if you want to see Jamaican voodoo dealers as heavier, and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick, this should be a satisfying view.
