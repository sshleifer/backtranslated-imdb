What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving Lynch's film version, I was very disappointed. I felt like I was looking at a rejection of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the play was a bit amateurish. The costumes were garish and over done, which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They must be Sandorm and yet they seemed to be "great stalactites" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were fairly different. I don't even want to start with the disgusting "Navigator" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called Frank Herbert's Dune wasn't even faithful to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". Keyboard elements were omitted, names changed, and the entire "feel" of the story was "sanitized". I didn't even recognize Harkonnens! In fact, most of the characters did not seem to have depicted them as Herber's descriptions. I'm starting to get sad to remember what was a tragedy. I'm glad I couldn't lose the second installment ....
