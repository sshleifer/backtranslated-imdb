I can accept the fact that this was the NEXT karate child, so Ralph Macchio can happily retire from the series and while Hillary Swank is great for the role .... the plot for the movie is just awful. <br /> <br /> Miyagi's old friend from World War II dies and leaves her widow to take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline, but is the hero because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a moment, has it to get her. You know the drill ... Miyagi takes her under her wing and ultimately beats the evil guys and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> It's hokey, its cheesy, it's the 90s. But it is not even the long and the short. My first case of "huh?" Why is there a "military division" in high school? I thought things went out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militant bungee jumps to scare the crap out of people .... why? What I noticed in all 4 films was ultimately the heels suddenly turned face after all the nonsense they had put through the protagonist (Billy in Part 1, Sato in Part 2, Kreese in Part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and cronies sabotage the senior priest first, blowing Eric's car and threatening Hillary Swank the whole movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat her up and they are like "um ... no" if you have to do pathetic face turns in at least make sure that the signs have not done anything over the top, such as blowing a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... corny but nothing to melodramatic, which is a fresh fresh air from the rubbish bin Ralph Macchio drawn in the first 3 films. <br /> <br /> I would say for his own movie after watching the first 3 movies, I can accept that it's more or less a spin off ... but I can't accept the whole military, everything too unusual for it to be taken seriously. Now, if Ironside and crew were a wrestling / football team and he was a coach, it would have been more credible. Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK ... the rest are the same As something, one highlight is when they jump up the hot rod, it was cool 4 out of 10
