This movie basically uses arbitration as one of its most important comic units. Now I switched it off when he literally tied her to the bed and raped her, but I can't really imagine how it eventually turned into something that was loving and fun. This movie not only wasted a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny, in fact it managed to be quite brutally disruptive and misogynistic. How so many people seem to find it a sweet family girl is beyond me. "I have definitely enjoyed canning the apricots last night" is not a fun joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hope that she will eventually learn to be able to like it. Looking at a viewing is not family fun. I honestly feel that I have seen half of this eerie "comedy" and are completely confused by these positive reviews.
