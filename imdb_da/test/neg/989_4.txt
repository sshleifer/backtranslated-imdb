Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the Galactic Railroad. I was expecting to see crazy stories and looking at an eccentric man and discovering his inspiration for such bizarre material. Boy, I was wrong. Spring and Chaos are mostly boring with only occasional moments of innovative animation. It is certainly not something to write home about and nowhere as well as NOTGR, which is something I suggest you see instead. Leave this bore alone. If you absolutely need to look, rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Don't pay top dollar.
