I had this movie given to me and must admit I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The back of the box makes it seem like a kind of sex triangle with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality of this movie is far from it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the other two characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all. Even films such as Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box is trying to compare to this movie) became riveting because of the unexpected turns and excitement. <br /> <br /> But Jaded has none of this. It concentrates on the rapes and the sick relationship with one of their lovers. And the regret of a videotape that can turn out to be the story of the victim is true. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that the same sex rape is possible, it's not a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> If possible, send this movie at any cost.
