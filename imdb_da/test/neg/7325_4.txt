I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to China, flying away in a balloon and so on, is her way of coping with a sad existence. I admit that I was progressing through one of the scenes where they two share friendship and simple pleasures, while soulful piano music plays in the background. Okay, three or four of those kinds of scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, it was fourteen. But I sat and saw most of them.
