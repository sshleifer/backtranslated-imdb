Worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of rude film production. All the ingredients to make this movie a true work of CRAP. Poor acting, poor conducting, poor storytelling, poor makeup, poor dialogue, bad effects and poor reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. It also threw a horrible naked shot of a stupid blonde and a breast of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were just scary as these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out of the 80s, but it could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in the story: he introduced characters at the end of the movie (an old man and an old woman). I would vote for it under 1 in 10, but the voting system doesn't seem to be that way. Right from the title sequence, I knew it would suck and I would return my DVD, but Best Buy does not refund DVDs or supplies as they call it, or my receipt says. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and it was really god-fearing, but I still feel that "Demon's Night" (an overtly evil, dead RIP-OFF) was far worse than "Dunwich Horror". It's like "The Howling" how the hell could continue to be milked out of this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just don't get any of its sequels though) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead." "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very poor investment. Every second of it was just madness, creepy pain for the audience, for the whole movie around was horrible! Do yourself a favor, don't see it! You save some brain cells.
