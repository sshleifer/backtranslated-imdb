Another attempt, another lady. France can be convicted of not producing a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the movie in Broc√©liande forest, but even the forest is fake! It was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant, and the text makes you wish you were deaf. Nothing could save it. <br /> <br /> Poor ... to the bone. I was not warned. I want my money back.
