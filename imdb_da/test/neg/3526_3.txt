** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait for a moment when we see him sneak into a girl shower and hack her to death and take her cut off and the blood arm as he does his escape. We then saw this official-looking prologue as if we saw a true story, from which it appears that a series of cruel murders were committed at the end of autumn 1985 in a small mid-western collage. Grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is confused by this murder, and later, when the murders of local collage students, all women, continue to run for the state's senator are in danger with him, the study bumbles at every turn. There is at least twice when Delboys says they will never be another murder as long as he is on the case, and in a few minutes another murder happens. <br /> <br /> Finding a golden amulet on site for every murder, the sheriff's daughter, collage librarian, finds Tina this reference book on Withcraft that suggests that the amulet is a symbol of a witch cult that originates from the beginning. 1700 right after Salem Witch Trials. This cult was out to revenge the 19 accused witches, who were hanged by local citizens back in 1692, and they went out at night and killed men and women with authority and left with a body part. When the body parts were to form a complete person, they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual. <br /> <br /> You never get a handle on what's just happening in the movie "Blood Cult", not just because it's a completely different story, but it's increasingly scandalous and the graduate level acing especially by Charles Ellis plays it butterfingered sheriff Ron Delboys. Getting into more trouble, even the loosened killer could have gotten him in. The bumbling Sheriff Delboy's ends up busted with coffee spiked and almost burned alive after being split. The only reason he wasn't, was because he seemed to have dreamed it all while he was influenced by some strong and unnamed drugs. <br /> <br /> There is a strange dream sequence in the movie, suggesting that a number of highly respected members of society are members of the witch cult responsible for the sorority murders. The film doesn't even like to explain whether the dream that the driven Sheriff Delboys had was a dream or indeed a real experience on his part by losing it all, as if it were cut out of the movie! <Br /> </ p> </ p> <p> Get out of the hospital and get out of the collage morality house while slipping down a bag full of McDonald's cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboy's finally comes to face the killer. Shefiff Delboys finds out his shock and astonishment that he not only knows who he or she is, but he is also willing to let the killer go! <br /> <br /> The very first thing to video and it turns out. Not only would it not be their real mind to have gone to pay admission, at least with the video you can lose over it, thank God, to see this disaster, but no filmmaker would dare play it on their screen without danger for the terrible borrowers, in a legitimate show of fair indignation, tear the place apart!
