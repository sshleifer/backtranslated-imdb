'Airport 4' is basically a mess to Universal Studios trying to work a new twist - Concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-heaven' formula. <br /> <br /> Posted with unintentional humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy holds his hand out of Concordes window at supersonic speed to burn a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile after the plane's flight path and the simple fact that these Stupid passengers continue boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /> <br /> Not really related to the other 'airport' movies.
