This film seems a bit lumpy around the edges as if it wasn't enough, zaniness was thrown at it when it should have been. But I enjoyed it most. The story is more than a little preposterous, so no expectation of "something right" must be included in your experience. Check your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and it may be an obstacle otherwise. I totally enjoyed Clennon's performance as the real Dr. Baird. His role was to give Aykroyd's character a protagonist. What a putz the real Dr. Baird was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as the main character's side kick. Annoying at first, but ultimately lovable. Sort of. Kind of. Or at least some use of a soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful. <br /> <br /> Worth looking at? If you are in the mood for a spear on the psychiatric profession, then why, why not.
