I chose this movie up from the local Family Video for sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign it was not good. Looking at 2 friends, none of them would even finish it because of how horrible this movie is. I oddly couldn't stop seeing it. But this movie is definitely a textbook on how not to make a movie. The plot is simple enough and sounds good: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind the pillars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmare begins to become reality again. Serial killings, Norris, roundhouse kicks ... it sounds like a good movie. <br /> <br /> And some of it is pretty good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van cascade from a rock and gets crushed is amazing - and I learned to break out of prison by no more than Chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. But there is very wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> One: the editor is a moron. When you make an action or thrill movie, keep the energy moving. There are too many scenes that are not essential to the plot back in this movie, lowering it and distracting from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut, and pacing would have improved, and the movie would be a little better. Two: The obedient guy is a moron. Apparently someone tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get a decent sound, so most of the dialogue sounds, kills stereo and doesn't dress up with the mouths. Also the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The Casting Director is a moron. They threw Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills has eyes and others) and would have made the right serial killer or some sort of villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four: The author is a moron. Two plots are in this movie - the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw the woman on the screen, I would clear my eyes. And of course she has never counted into the other plot, which makes her story completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever see this again? Maybe. But unless they remaster this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
