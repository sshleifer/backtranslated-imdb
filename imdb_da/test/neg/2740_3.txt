I've just seen Descent. Gawds what a horrible movie. Right from the bat, they depict a lava geyser and a note says it is miles below the surface of Washington State. People, there are no geysers deep in the ground like that. They thought it looked good, and in typical Hollywood style they threw it in. And then there is so good that spear lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a splash. The steam would have gone off well before a lava beach could, if ever. <br /> <br /> And the play was also pretty bad. Micheal Dorn is immersed in a new low job. <br /> <br /> Which dog of a movie. I bet the vote does not exceed a 3.5. It didn't look like SciFi Channel used for much more than having beautiful boy Perry as an attempt to draw.
