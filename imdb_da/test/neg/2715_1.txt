Yes, it was a horrible movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, I think called "I have a Woody" or something like that. I would love to find a soundtrack about it if there is one available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and it was as terrible as it was, it was the moment, and the song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like babes in bikinis, it's the movie for you, but if you don't, you won't bother. It was fantastic material for MST 3K, I must admit. I would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack itself. Not only that song but a couple more were really fun and are classics as far as I'm concerned.
