This is a fair movie, good for one-time description. The plot itself is quite well-crafted for a picture of this kind, which is a pleasing surprise as it acts, even though a small hammy is better than normal for these types of flick. <br /> <br /> The special effects are hilarious - a translucent giant and a blatant polystyrene / papier mache hand wobbling convincingly on a little wire. <br /> <br /> Definitely see once for kitsch entertainment value. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
