Let me say that this new He-Man cartoon does not destroy childhood memories, nor did I like the old He-Man cartoon. I loved the figurines, but I found the comic to be corny and I hated the story (the man I liked was the one from the very early comic book comics included in the picture boxes where He-Man was a barbarian , the sword of power was divided into two, and there was no prince adam, no shazam ripoff prize and no ork). However, let us leave the old things alone. The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a disgrace alone; it represents both the oldest shows worst cheeses and the worst trends today. I saw it because I had heard your morals' morality in the old show was (fortunately) gone, and this had more swords and character development. But I encountered an awful mishmash of the worst cliches in the genre, characters I couldn't help but hate and unfortunately the inevitable Matrix-esque visual style. I think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters as it showed a scare in advance, but that's how far the character development goes, except for the usual come-to-age waste that I see in the subsequent episodes where this teenybopper adam will learn the responsibility of his newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show, Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself pulling his gut. That's what we get when they exhibit a fairytale show aimed at pre-teens: beautiful faces and will-be-cool-and-look-juvenile clothes. I should check new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special look. Human, reminds me of the 1996 Flash Gordon stinkbomb cartoon! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Ha! It follows absolutely all the clich√©s in the book, from goody-lil-two-shoes Randor in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal "Oh and He-Man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high kind than in the old series. 20 years and nothing we have learned. <br /> <br /> And today, there can't be any external action related, it's not Matrix style. Leave anime for Japanese, people, think new ideas. And seeing the characters' make up during the games didn't help either. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about who the hell comes up with these names?) has no yellow skin now, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu won't appear on the show either. Shadows from the 1996 FG again, where Ming Merciless was a green, paddle-like alien! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I would have liked it more or less if Cringer spoke, he's corny enough this way. And you have your extra ration of cheese with Orko! The shocking thing is probably many of the people who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks, maybe big Orko fans ... <br /> <br /> I saw the duty time pilot and I got enough. Let the series be alone. 2 out of 10
