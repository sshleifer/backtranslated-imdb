Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made "Bamako", but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion to find out what that purpose might have been. <br /> <br /> The nominal "plot" involves a young African singer who plans to leave his unemployed man to find work in the city. But far more of the screen time has been taken up by what the film's audience describes as "a mock trial against key institutions" that employ "with Africa's overwhelming economic difficulties." It is all good and good, I suppose, but when the arguments and ideas are portrayed as uranium and pedantic in a way they are here, they lose both power and influence. In another way, if the director had found the means to actually incorporate problems such as the detrimental effect of colonialism on African people and the problem of African debt into something that even resembles a compelling story, the film could have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it lacks now clear. <br /> <br /> The topics that the movie deals with may be relevant and important, but trying to give up what is equivalent to two hours worth of talking as a real, honest-to-God movie probably won't get a lot of an audience to their message.
