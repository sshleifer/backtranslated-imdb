This movie was really bad. I really mean really bad. The scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think it was a great waste of time and money, and Michael Shanks with his 'Shaggy from Scooby Doo' picture just made me laugh. Never waste your time with this image ... I really don't know what the director was thinking of having seen the last cut of this movie, but the fighting was so unrealistic that it made my eyes look at them. 'Latex Cat Women' fighters were just getting rolling around the scenes and looking scared around as they had no idea what to do on stage ... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 picture.
