Out of the handful of alternative titles in English, the "Sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate, as this is only a shameless rip off of William Friedkin's classic horror movie, replacing the 13-year-old Linda Blair with 19-year-old Stella Carnacina for to be able to show his hectic naked body with freedom. I'm not sure exactly what Satan is trying to achieve here, but he seems to have only the young girl playing sexual tricks on her! Poor Danila masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father to have sex with her. The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology student with a weird look girlfriend (running a stupid yellow car) and loving, though outdated parents. When she takes a peculiar crucifixion home for renovation, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Vampire's Planet") begins to plague her. The over-masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three-quarters of the movie, and finally, director Mario Garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. The last segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests do nothing but say some vague prayers, but somehow Danila seems to be completely healed. There is not much to do, the dialogues are awful, and the producers seem to compensate every little mistake by adding more sleaze! This is one of the rare Italian exploitation efforts (why in hell do they refer to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But definitely not one of the best. If you want clones of "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
