This movie was so bad it was comfortable. If you want to see a soap opera cast, you decide to make an action movie, this is for you! Overactive, irrelevant events, unmanageable dialogue - it has it all. The protagonist has a split personality and cannot think of whether he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who wants to risk his life for others. He is plausible in neither of these roles. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The head of the company, whose building is set on fire, shows the same unpredictability, and so does his wife. And the punch line - who has taken "chip" - beggars believe. I found myself laughing, and therefore I recommend that you see it.
