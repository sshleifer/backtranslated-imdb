Flatland is one of my favorite books, and I was therefore looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is horrible. The dialogue is so bad, it sounds like improv half the time. The new story tells me that they took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what came out of the manuscript. It is a shame for the book and independent filmmaking. The only reason I even managed to get all the way through the film was my hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, it was only worse, climaxing in a really retarded ending. <br /> <br /> It's not saying everything about the movie is bad. CG is acceptable, in a 1990's "Reboot" kind of way I assume is what they needed. And I suppose you can't go wrong with "people" being chopped in half and killing blood everywhere.
