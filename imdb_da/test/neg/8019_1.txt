A couple of teenagers have sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They say they are fifteen, while one of the players is really twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching "taboo" subjects, but I cannot imagine that anything shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. <br /> <br /> Large dialogs are mixed with even lower music disco. The selection of songs involves nothing more than the very well-known "classics" still heard on every other radio station today. The plot of American Pie is not much different, but at least it is a little fun. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that it had six successors!
