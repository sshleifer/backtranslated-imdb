All it has to offer is Tru and Jack's interesting contradictions, their choices and views, and the philosophical issues it raises. Tru feels she helps people who should not die, and Jack feels they are supposed to die, and she shatters with the plane of fate or the plan of the universe or whatever, not. <br /> <br /> But of course she is able to change things so there is apparently no such thing as the fate of the series' metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very comfortably Tru never asks him the right questions. No one does it It clearly shows that the series decision makers have no answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave the creepy thing for the series to be able to continue with the boring girl thing, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack's racing against each other at ends that are unknown. .. It turns out there's nothing to do with it. A teenage pop series with it pretends to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time is better spent sleeping.
