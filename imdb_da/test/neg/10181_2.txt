The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason I felt compelled to finish it! Basically, I wanted to see if there were any foreigners, any UFOs, anything suggested by the movie's title, the film's cover, and the movie's beginnings! I was very disappointed to see that religion was thrown into the mix as it was. This could have been used for the benefit of the movie, but instead I felt the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! Finally, how big was this thrown wardrobe! I was so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts that each figure had on each new scene that I began to wonder if this movie was not really to be classified under "bad comedy". <br /> <br /> toe thumbs down!
