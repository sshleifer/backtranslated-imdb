There is not much to add to what others have already commented on, the film fails hard, where it should not, it has no depth in the planning of the hoist, and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me think was that, even though the rest of the band is trying hard to remove the pins from a hood truck because there should be no other way to open it, the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck that happens with a hole in it so that he can come out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could believe he could get out of there or even better that they could have gotten from there. <br /> <br /> Promising but not quite there.
