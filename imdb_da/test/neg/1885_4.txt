In fact, although it is inevitably associated with the decade of the 70s, the concept of "exploitation-cinema" is almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios invented almost the term with their long running monster bikes Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Every original classic created at least a couple of successors, and after a while they even thought of the idea of ​​making real monster dusting! "House of Frankenstein", released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a very successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but the "House of Dracula" is a little too loony for me to recommend it. The reason suffers too much from extremely annoying "random" situations, forced twists and dialogues and ?? most of all ?? a far too short time to work out the personalities of the monsters that they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive top billing, but plays the most fundamental role as a miracle, a doctor who is challenged to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) from his uncontrollable thirst for blood and was allowed to correct Lawrence Talbot's disease to mutate in a hair Wolf Man when the moon is full. During a nocturnal walk in some caves, they also pick up Frankenstein's monster, and the good doctor even gradually undergoes a Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to poor blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback (though not by Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you see a movie literally filled with horror icons, but the only sign in the whole movie that can freak you out is a common villager named Siegfried. The actual monsters are dull and their unique fabulous backgrounds are completely drained. Count Dracula is a whining romantic, Talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and Frankenstein creation ?? Well, his share is not even worth mentioning. There is a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this universal film, especially in relation to all their other efforts, and the sudden climax is a disaster.
