The waste of 1h45 this unpleasant little movie is one to avoid, its like a cheap badly plotted cross between the saw and a few other recent movies about kidnap, why the author wrote this is obvious. He has no soul and did it to try me some money. The twists were obvious as they were in danger of escaping they made it obvious and not etc ... only good things about it I have discovered 1 new actress worth seeing ..peyton list, not seeing the shuttle however there are too many nicer ones movies to look rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world. Spend your time wisely watching good movies, doing some exercise, making a good meal .. anything but waste your time on waste like this
