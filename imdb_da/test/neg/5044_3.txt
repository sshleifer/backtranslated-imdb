Gargoyle begins late in a night in 'Romania 1532' as a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels together in her horse and carriage with her own business when, from the moonlit clouds over a living gargoyle, she sucks and attacks her, she manages to escape Gargoyle & happens at a slot of a description where an angry crowd of local villagers and a priest are able to put an end to Gargoyle, or they believe ... Shards to the present Bucharest, where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are negotiating the safe return of their son to a rich American ambassador from his kidnappers. Following on from one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large blood cell and no visible signs of what happened to him. However, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) a church when the church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found some old relics, the two are investigating and finding a cave with lots of slimy cocoons and a very sour and very vivid gargoyle that does not waste time killing them both. Griffin & Wells is the case when reported and soon realizes that local legends of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) who plans to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br /> Co-written, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is yet another masterpiece Wynorski can add to his credits, not. The script from Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe are crap, are unexciting, boring and are as simplistic as you can get. Initially, I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle left, who put all these eggs because I am pretty sure it could not have become pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know that it was there? Why has no one ever found out? Why would the priest flood the world with them? To govern it? Gargoyles hardly take over the world, and let a priest just rule it as a king and if they did what would be left to rule? Like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I don't think he believed it well? Whether I look at it, no matter where I approach it, from which angle I'm trying to figure out, no matter how many times I try to square circle Gargoyles just doesn't make sense, and their story has great plot holes, lapses in logic and is not so good to start with anyway. The character is blunt and clich√©d, the action repeated and unexciting, while the film as a whole is a real barring to sit through. People do illogical things and everything that happens is far to practical, as when the pastor tries to convince Griffin that Gargoyle is present and you suddenly come up and attack them. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of foreigners (1986) it is embarrassing and the end was paralyzed. The bit of the big ferris wheel at the fair was fun, but when the guy mopped the boys fear of heights and forced him to move on. Director Wynorski reduces costs and steals footage from other films, in fact, the best scene from Gargoyle is a car race through Bucharest, but it was taken from Jean-Claude Van Damme's action movie Maximum Risk (1996). There is no shock, scare or atmosphere. The special effects are horrible, CGI Gargoyle resembles that it belongs in a computer game and has little interaction with all live cast members. There are many scenes of people who look up to the sky and try to appear honorable. There is not even something worth doing to make the matter visible, which is a horrible closure, and that is it. Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise it is acceptable that the Romanian locations look appropriate Romanian. Gargoyle went straight-to-video and it shows with a beautiful cheap look and feel. The actor is not too much, personality bypass victim Michael Pare makes for the stupid of boring heroes. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle is a crap film that fails everything a decent creature should strive for. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.
