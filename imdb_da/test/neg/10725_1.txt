A satire of greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this failure than in any of the themes they are pathetically trying to make fun of. Jim Carry's government was definitely short-lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The imprecision of his depiction is nothing short of scary. He also produced this "masterpiece" so he cannot blame anyone here. "The first comedy in America" ​​shouts desperate television additions. Of course, Jim Carrey was to guarantee entire houses, but the game is over. If I'm sound, it's because I'm. I spent a sunny afternoon in California plus between tickets, parking, flat coks, etc., almost $ 45 on this thing, starring and produced by Mr Carry. No more, do you hear? Not anymore.
