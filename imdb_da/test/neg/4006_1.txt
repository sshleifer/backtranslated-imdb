I was one, probably had a brainfish at the time of renting it. Anyone who actually buys it will enjoy using this as a coaster. Maybe a Frisbee? This is a DVD I actually found up front where the kids could get to it. Since DVDs do not seem to be put in the tell narrative back room with the whole box of VH's tapes, I find it rather annoying they are stuck next to a Disney movie. Yep, going from dinosaur to Erotic Ghost has shown what we all think about Disney right? I haven't bent it down yet. There is no action in here. The only interesting thing is the old 1973 movie trailers for all old erotic movies, which I am surprised to escape being burned to hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb is allowed zero, it would be 0/10)
