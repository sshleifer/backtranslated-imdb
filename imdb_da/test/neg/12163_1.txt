Okay, I think I'm pretty much a fan of spiders, mutilated and destroyed Stephen King stories (when they reach the screen) like some of us sad Masochists here. I know most of them are badly done. I expect it. I'm planning it. I humbly allow it ... <br /> <br /> But this time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw this thing many years ago ... fine. I thought I remembered it was pretty good ... PREVIOUS ... As I say (done in a wordy, annoying, roundabout :) I really didn't try to be snobbish or expect much, but what was this thing , a mini series? I have only one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you may justify pulling things out minute by minute, scene after scene by friggin 'ENDLESS, totally significant, and mind numbingly SLOW dialogue? I think every bl ** dy scene is two people "DISCUSSER" how they feel back and forth and D ... R ... A ... I ... T bl ** dy good O. .. U ... T After about an hour and a half, which I think is about 1/2 of the maturity (I did not check, sorry) I finally got tired! After an hour and a half what had happened other than the original accident ...? They run away while "Shop" guy killed ophthalmologists, news photographers and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of meandering dialogue. I'm sorry I promise it's not that I have unobstructed thoughtless action; I love lots of movies where there is not much, but in them at least when they talk, and such meaningful things are said and characters are deep, thoughts are conveyed ... EASY !!! Okay, I admit that the actors themselves were not too bad (except Stephen King, of course :) I liked the Shop guy, I thought both "older" people were fine. I liked the general and the greatest woman. It's just if they could have cut out all the HOURS of filler, that's all I say. I mean, it's SUPPOSED to be a Sci Fi Thriller, kind of ..., right? you know what really took the price when the shop guy unnecessarily made one of his many times filling in phone calls, this time he is talking to God that WHO gets all the emotional (for him anyway) and acting like he can't handle the. .. WTF !!! ??? The guy has clearly proven to be a cold blood, effective killer. What the hell was it about ??? So just multiply it by about 500, and that's basically why I finally turned halfway through; it was either that or hangs me, I swear! I think there are other kings' adjustments out there that are paralyzed, but at least they move ...! Oh well, I think maybe you are in the "story" and don't mind crawling together and getting the ultimate and gloomy patience to wait until the end, it may be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I sincerely doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I don't write these things very often, but this time I just had or I couldn't sleep at night ( as i did during the show! :)
