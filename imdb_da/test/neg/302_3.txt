"The Secret Life" starts with the worst possible story: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too terrible to make a movie about ...". Okay, so what do you suggest? That we should not bother to continue to watch as the film will not be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right too! The film is not least shocking and contains almost no blood or do it at all. Though I think this is mainly due to the low budget values ​​and not because of Dahmer's crimes that are too horrifying. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is only one sequence repeated again and again. Young, pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always men when he was gay), kills them and then talks about how it was not his intention to hurt them and how lonely he is. It gets boring really fast and even the admirable performance of the unknown actor Carl Crew cannot save this movie from being a total dud. Yet this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly dull "Dahmer" released in 2002.
