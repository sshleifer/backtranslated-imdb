Okay, let's be realistic about this. No one enters a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn-controlled (the man gave the world panties between the cheeks) starring a wrestler named Kane and expecting a little slice of art on a golden plate. If you do, you'll probably find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what do we expect from a movie like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad play. 2) A rather non-existent, clich√©d story. 3) Kane walks around with a shriveled, sour face, indicating his nostrils, just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are hungry for some "so bad, fun" entertainment, then this may satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all points. Of course, movies like this can be best viewed for free, but if you choose to sacrifice money on cash then have fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are good enough to introduce us to each of the annoying crimes by flashing their names and offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see if predictions are most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your friends write down every moment of stupidity and madness that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my total quantity was 107; can you beat it? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire this abandoned hotel still has power, running water and a worklift? I know that the filmmakers assume that if you pay to see this then of course you should not put much emphasis on what you spend your money on and it will probably not think about how stupid the movie is, but that doesn't mean that we cannot point to it and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to turn this large hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for the demolition of any sensible inspector) to a homeless shelter and they find the best way to get it Cleared up is to give eight punks a few mops and chrome. Uh-huh. I think you know pretty much what you can expect, but I feel the need to give you a few warnings. Firstly, if you hate the interaction interaction regardless of the movie then you might stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were on a real wrestling program. Shouts of "Kill Him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoing through the theater and highlighting what I hope is not the best of what America has to offer. I usually do not appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheese party like that I thought the comment was added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others might be annoyed by it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and it does not even justify the explanation, the film does not shade away from gore. If you see a big ugly guy ripping his eyes straight out of their sockets, "funny night in the cinema doesn't scream!" for you you know good and good to save your dough. I must say I was a little surprised at the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's side. I didn't expect him to be in a functioning clinic, but I hoped he would have a cute little catchphrase like "Say goodnight" (his character's name is "Goodnight") just before killing a victim. Instead, he pronounced four words throughout the film - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he gave them flawlessly! <br /> <br /> If I was a bad guy in a movie, my catchphrase would be something like "Place your BETTS!" or "All BETTS are off!" <br /> <br /> It would rule and you know it. We need a new genre designation for bad horror movies such as the See No Evil that evokes so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to feel them comedians. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we just want to call them HOR-larious!
