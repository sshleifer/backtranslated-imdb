"Direct to Video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless it is a direct-to-video sequel to something that went straight to video in the first place. Despite this, the studios have insisted on releasing many direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. I do not think it should even be mentioned that these successors are among some of the worst titles at all times, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is appropriate that ROAD HOUSE 2 became hell of Scott Ziehl as He was also the man in charge of destroying the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a good guy, and rehashed them without success at all. This is no successor, this is a remake all the way. Different lines from the original are repeated, plot points are cut and inserted, and scenes are almost replicated shot for shot from the first. The only thing that could not be duplicated was the fantastic battle scenes that made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we get clumsy directed battle sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour. Compare it to its predecessors' battle scenes, which look as if they took months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to control action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. The spiders, but none of the talents shown are coming through in this mess. It is not quite his fault, as the manuscript is very, very poorly written and lumpy. I don't care if going straight to video, a good script is still needed. Someone should keep this in mind as they continuously run these low-budget, direct-to-DVD movies. Skip it all over. 1.10
