Of all the movies in the film's story, I can't imagine anyone sitting down and saying I would spend X amounts of dollars (or pounds) to restore the failed classic movie called "Breeders." Lots of stories have been transformed into movies about meteors coming to Earth with something creepy lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of "It came from outer space" instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of displaying a rubberized set of monsters and some naked coeds? Was the 1986 edition of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time it was done correctly? When you come down to it, the only reason this movie exists is to show Britcom's cutie pie Samantha Janus. But if you have to make a skin flick and exploit Sam Janus in it, you would rather have her more naked than this and be more sober than this if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" ended up ensues. <br /> <br /> I honestly never thought I'd ever recommend the original "Breeders" over any other movie, but it would be the one that came in second place for it.
