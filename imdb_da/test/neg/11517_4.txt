When I watched this movie three years ago, I thought it exemplified many of the features found in Singapore's art house film: slowly, with a minimal plot and dialogue depending on the film composition to make it work. <Br /> <br /> In the meantime, there is an inability of local cinemas to appreciate "Be With Me" in the same way as "Citizen Kane" or one of Oz's late films. I have no idea how "Be With Me" reached such sacred heights in Singapore's film consciousness, but I have always felt that Khoo's "12-story" is a better movie, even though the latter does not boast as good as a film photographer as Adrian Tan, Khoo's DP for "Be With Me". "12 Storeys" has a story that better relates to most Singaporean people and has also bitten something that "Be With Me" vulnerable wistfulness does not have. <br /> <br /> "Be with me" is basically a barely interconnected trio of tales stuck together in a movie by Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. It's about a security guard who falls in love with a girl he only sees in the distance; two girls in a hororotic relationship and the story of deaf and blind Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Join me" is very well-liked by Tan, using a Varicam camera. The compositions of the film are masterful. The film, almost completely silent, has almost no dialogue. Characters move around, not in a realistic way, but almost as if they were models under the instructor's instructor, almost always looking at the screen and emotions: either loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters are not acting against each other. This kind of movie has been seen many times: in the Tsai Ming-liang movie, in the Khoo protest gay Royston Tan's "4:30" and elsewhere. Unfortunately, its ultra-slowness (essentially plot less) and the use of a lento piano soundtrack appeal to me. <br /> <br /> To criticize "Be with me" almost ignores the inspirational story behind it, Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf, yet lives a satisfying life after all this, but I'm afraid that this movie does nothing for me. I am willing to applaud Chan's firm and courageous march in life and Tan's striking filmography, but to better take the same subject with more meat (without the other two boring and distracting plates), try Werner Herzog's "Land of Silence and Darkness "(1971).
