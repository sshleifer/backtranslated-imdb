The story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked to find that he had a twin brother when his body was found in Nice. Investigating the murder he finds out that he was in possession of a list describing the actions of the Russian mafia. Using his brother's boyfriend, Alain kills Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents while trying to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another of the long list of action films containing Jean-Claude Van Damme. As far as things go, it is strictly formal. The scriptures stick to the clichés and the actor is mediocre. There are some nicely executed action sequences with an inventive car fight, a fiery building battle, an escape through rooftops, a brutal battle in an elevator, and JCVD ​​flying its enemies over an elevated train line. Ringo Lam's director keeps everything going at a reasonable pace.
