It sounded so promising in Rental Store, the premise sounded good, and I couldn't wait to come home and see it. It was the Apalling Diologist's awful, the action is extremely poor Scripted, and the plot takes a nosedive from the beginning. Gutenberg puts in a pathetic performance, Sean Bean tries his best, but with a script that's bad, there wasn't much he could do. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth seeing, although you can get it for free (borrow it from a friend for example) Dont like to regret it and waste 90 myinuites in your life. <br /> <br /> 0/10
