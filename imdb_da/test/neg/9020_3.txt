Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie has been edited poorly, but it has a campy element that makes it easier to see it. The villain is an anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent that is fun. The girl is dressed as a Jean Harlow wannabe, after all it is 1934. At least the location shoots are beautiful and comfortable. <br /> <br /> See it and laugh. Don't expect a serious Western but rather a light and superficial story of bad actors, but occasionally camp humor flashes. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and beautiful, and you can see his acting ability blossoming years after this regrettable venture.
