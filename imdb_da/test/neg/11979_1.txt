Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me throw physical !! <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie, though the story looked like the game's plot. whole super human soldiers thing. Except that Jack Carver, a completely American man in the game, is played by a germ, unless it's a kind of twisted irony, that's what made me pull a middle finger on my TV screen the other it started. The fact that you can tell it filmed in a forest in the middle of what seemed to be in the middle of summer, it is not unconditional, because the game is set in the tropical rainforest while it looks like the director just looked out the window in the morning and went "it's a good forest". THIS IS A NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: If you ever plan to make a movie based on a game / book game, understand it and ask fans about it ... don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it !!!
