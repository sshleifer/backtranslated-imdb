Boring, clumsy and predictable. The only original piece was the Brighton location for the gangster. It is certainly not "Lock Stock etc ......." Hannah was sympathetic to "Shoot Doors". In "Circus" I developed no empathy with his character and could not give a caste what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this movie was so clumsy and predictable, the end was no surprise, I was so uninterested that I didn't even worry why the movie was named "Circus" ....... Booooring ....... Don't visit this great top
