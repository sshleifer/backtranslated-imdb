As a fan of C.J.'s previous film, Last Days, I would really like this movie. The best thing I can say, however, is that it is not a horrible movie. There are some good performances and some fun scenes. Tori Spelling especially has a couple of fantastic scenes where she talks to her fiancé ex-girlfriend. Overall, it is a nice week though. The manuscript falls back on strange coincidences and cliché movie moments all too often. (The protagonist went to Stanford for a golf study and his high school friend doesn't even know he's playing the game?) <br /> <br /> Mostly, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say . There are many scenes that are mildly sweet, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters from the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> For all the mistakes, I have to say that this is one of the best gay movies in recent years. That says a lot about how bad most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope C.J.'s next movie is getting better.
