I've been amazed at the enthusiastic response to this movie. It seemed boring to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often went bad. It also seemed like an intense sexist movie: If the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone would have some sense in arms complaining that the film is intensely misogynistic. It is not only that both the main men are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are depicted as almost flawless, forming a utopian society lacking any kind of conflict and resting on relentless generosity and goodness. humor. Utopias are notoriously boring, and it turns out to be no exception. But it is also interesting to note what happens (and here the plot giveaway, although it refers to a very early stage), when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother hurries to take responsibility for it, and (2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life disappears from the movie). It is not quite a glorious killing, even though Aldomovar's camera licks the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as if it makes an attractive painting, and then it becomes soaked and out of sight without bloody, neither daughter nor mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals another killing, again by a man of a man, and again it is a killing that the movie implicitly supports. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and actually conflicting ideology, and so I write an ideological criticism. But apart from that, it's just not very interesting. It has none of the depth, says Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.
