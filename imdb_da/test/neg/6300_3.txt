The costumes are outrageous, and the Australian outback scenery is fun to see, but there is an edge to this story - a mid-range - about the congress. I especially noticed that in Terrence Stamp's character, "Ralph Bernadette Pools." Perhaps it was appropriate because there is no "good guy-like" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group "queens". <br /> <br /> Once again we get the strong liberal slope that says something goes and if you're not "with it" - or in this case pro-gay, you're a homophobe. (Gasp!) What is really worrying is the end when a young boy goes off with his "alternative lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fits the story, but because it fits the agenda of the people who wrote the script . Pitiful.
