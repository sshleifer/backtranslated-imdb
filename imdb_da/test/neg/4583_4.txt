But as a movie from Disney two generations ago, this movie also fails in the accuracy department. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the true story of everyday life for movie producers? I do not think. There is ample evidence to accurately depict their true story rather than the fictitious accounts we've had to suffer through. <br /> <br /> Some day, a movie will accurately reproduce Bobby's owner, John Gray, as Edinburgh's policeman, as he was, and properly exhibit Bobby's license that he was paid by Lord Provost. When that happens, I come to the theaters.
