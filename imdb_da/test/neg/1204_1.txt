A teenager who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot, leaves for a foreign country to save his father. If this is not ridiculous enough, he speaks a colonel in the Air Force to help him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, Colonel risks his career and life by giving the spunky some hands to help. They not only make columns like this more, but they never did. This sappy, corny film must be thrown into the air and blown away by a MIG.
