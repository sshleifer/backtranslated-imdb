What about studios like Paramount, who have a documented hit film series on their hands, and expect to turn around with their budget and formula? Paramount spent less on this movie than they did on TMP, which doesn't sound bad before you realize there are 10 spaces between when the movies were made. The $ 40 TMP cost to make would be around $ 75 million in 1989. This movie is why Shatner has never been given a fair chance of leading other movies. Every time he turned around, the study studied the budget and made demands on the story. The fact that this was the only story that Roddenberry and Shatner could agree on, mostly made the freshman directorial task hard enough, but after all the machinations were done, everyone ended up with a bumpy story and a cargo badly executed special effects. which is not worthy of the original series, much less a large film picture. The most sharp examples: - All Phaser effects were severely cut and fake. - The Enterprise shot that went into the big barrier was, of course, a still-frame shot that was zoomed away. At least, the popsicle pin that kept the Enterprise cut out was successfully exhausted. - God "chases" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they might as well just cut in the shot of the Godzilla climbing volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985" and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion out of the movie to do electric bolts come out of his eyes on the imperial captain Kirk .... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the look of the last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thank you Star Trek VI was such a release of a movie ...
