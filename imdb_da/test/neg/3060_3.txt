It is too friendly to call this a "fictionalized" account of the Barker band. They got the names right, but it's about it. Russell is still hot, I give it to you, but it's not the real Ma Barker who basically took care of the boys by cooking and helping when they moved around the country, not by planning or participating in the crimes. I think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a medieval woman trapped in her children's criminal activities and their cronies. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with the reviewers who found the shoot-out scenes to be incredible. The Barker / Karpis victims were a combination of the innocent and law enforcement agents who pursued them, but they certainly did not hit the fifty FBI agents each time they became the corner. (On the other hand, as more recent books have related, the FBI emphasized in the era the idea of ​​agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds, to the extent many agents had very little law enforcement or firearm experience. They were not well-trained agents as we pictured today.) <br /> <br /> But the worst sin is all that the movie is basically a bore. No one changes, no one grows. We know that the end of the road is ahead, we just don't know which shoot-out it will be. <br /> <br /> Only for die-hard Russell fans.
