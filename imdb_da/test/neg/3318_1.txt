Although I hadn't read Anne Rice's "Queen of the Damned" from "Vampire Chronicles", I would probably have thought that this movie was just awful. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, plot-less it made absolutely no sense at all. I sat for a while and thought about the plot that was separate from the book, and the longer I thought about it, the worse it was. In order to connect it in any way with the previous Chronicles, movies are ridiculous, as it is ridiculously incompatible with that movie, let alone the book. They just got ideas taken from the rice genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" were slaughtered and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy of being Aaliyah's last movie. It is indeed an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Optionally, the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics. Well as they may be, it's still not enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie. In fact, I signed up for this membership for the sole reason to communicate to people who are bothering to watch this movie (7 years after the release as it may be) so as not to waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment.
