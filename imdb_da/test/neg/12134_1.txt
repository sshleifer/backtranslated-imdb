We've all seen bad movies, well it takes the cake. I've seen the junior movie box staring many times back from my many trips to the horror section of the local video store, and I was a little interested, it seems to give a tribute to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I I get it. Error! Junior sucks hard, long and with commitment. In other words, it is very bad. Although it wins my prize for the most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID!!
