this show disturbs me. It takes up slots at nick on the nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. They are all better than home improvement. First, the mother annoys Jill so much. She is a hypersensitive whiny baby and I really despise myself. brad is a bold spout and he is also annoying. and the youngest brother, I don't even know his name! I do not notice him at all! It is probably not the actors' fault, but it is probably the authors. Tim is just a stupid ass. Although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favorite, I don't like any of them. The only reason I gave this stupid show three stars is a star going to randy. As a middle child, he is still a sad little brother, but an elder brother, and I like his fun character. the other star goes to Al. As the shabby friend, his character is passionate. Apart from Randy and Al, this show sucks.
