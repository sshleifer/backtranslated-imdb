I was 12 years old when I saw the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!") It was a fun movie and not just for kids. This horrible remake it is pathetic even for a 5 year old! What did Disney have to destroy their reputation and remind of a nice movie, I don't know, and I just can't believe it. Even the title song in the original movie (both original version and the doubled Italian version) was extremely nice and created the mood for the story. On this remake, the title song is just worse than the movie itself. It was just nice to see Dean Jones, even though he only had a como look, he was regular on the big old Disney movie. I honestly can't see anything else positive in this restored movie.
