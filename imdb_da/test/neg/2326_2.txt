I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we pay more in the UK) as a friend had told me that it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that opening credits were a failed ... dance / music not very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and the unexpected crash just as the lady passenger would be injured was a good touch .. something unexpected ... though the way she walked away from the car with her hair perfectly prepared and still carrying a handbag, corny looked for most directors. but for Lynch there was something else. <br /> <br /> Her dazed went after such a shock was amplified by a regular low noise similar to the fingers scratching along a board; I thought another Lynch master touch might exhibit the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatized self-conscious. After a while, this noise became somewhat annoying, and upon further investigation I discovered the new video cassette creaking. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this squeak removed a lot of my pleasure, but this movie was a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. There were no male characters of any value, and apart from a few vague good scenes (the hoover ignition), there were too many terrible scenes that were generally weak and ridiculous. Eg. The coffee is spit in the napkin by the threatening wage and the stupid monster face behind the dinner. Oh and what about paint in the wifes jewels .. drilling and naff. This whole movie gives you the feeling of the failed genius .. you know when you listen to the worst Dylan track ever and think my God who was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole feeling is that a failed TV movie is poorly paired with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating. <br /> <br /> Over the last 30 minutes, I whizzed it. <br /> <br /> Allow me another chance and look again. If I want to get confused and work hard to understand a movie, I'll see the Frank Woods Guide to Consolidated Accounting. Lynch made a classic .. Blue Velvet and Straight Story were nice. <br /> <This was, like Wild at Heart, a disappointment; His amusement is now predictable and out of date. Anyone want to buy a 2nd hand video? <br /> <br /> Make room for some younger original talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and no more). Pardon.
