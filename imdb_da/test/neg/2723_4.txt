This could have been a good TV movie, but flashbacks don't make it easier to understand the movie. As they give viewers information on the way (will the film continue), I found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned it at the beginning. Then the whole track would probably not have been necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. Too bad that the producer / director used flashbacks in this way, but on the other hand the film was not worth much. <br /> <br /> Nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.
