This in-name-only sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) coming to his uncle (Will Patton) when uncle is hardly beaten up by a local drug bench led by the wood indian of an actor Jake Busey. The band wants to take over the poor guy's bar for false reasons. Patrick Swayze is very much missed here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass-kicking lawyer. The fighting here is intermittent and not as strong or malicious as the fighting in ROADHOUSE. The final is just as weak. Some beautiful women keep things in the air a little. There is a fantastic match between a Daisy Duke type that turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a creepy-looking child of Busey, who is handy with sharp gear. There is also a bit of madness in the beginning, which is a co-author of Schaech's, but unfortunately she is never seen again in the movie. Too bad. She did a short round dance for Schaech who had my full attention. Otherwise, ROADHOUSE 2 goes with a strip club scene that will darned close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is snooze time.
