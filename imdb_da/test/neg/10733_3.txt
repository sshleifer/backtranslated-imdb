Detective Sergeant Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious serial Killer / Rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or will she be the next victim's killer? And what about the murderer's hilarious White Dude Afro? <br /> <br /> Inspired by serial killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight" aka "The Dark Ride" is a rather tedious Serial Killer tale from 1978 that doesn't give much. If that is something, it is more a political procedural flip than a horror movie, as much of the violence comes out of the camera. Sure, we get mutilated bodies, but we don't get much in the exploitation department - especially given that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime. Those who hope for "Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. Fortunately, there is an impressive scene with a woman trying to escape the killer who gets her tone right and is pretty exciting to start. John Karlen is also quite effective as the killer, although his hilarious hairstyle (white boys with Afros is always a chuckle) is more than a little distracting. "The Dark Ride" is too routine and mediocre to really justify a recommendation as it lacks the actual exploits and is dated even to the standards of time. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Don't go to the house" and a few others instead, as it just doesn't cut it.
