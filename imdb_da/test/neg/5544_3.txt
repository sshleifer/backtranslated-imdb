Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80's horror-flick. No classic in any way, but a comfortable piece of fluff. Why have we been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. As in previous successors, there is nothing here to really connect the movies except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time out we follow the feud between Hatfields and McCoys. Part of the movie is a Romeo and Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy, and his Hatfield lover decides to run away to be together. But soon they are deleted from each other and the boy's sister is killed. The boy escapes to the forest and causes the witch to revive Pumpkinhead for some revenge. The action can at best be amateurish at worst. The titular demon does not really show for nearly forty minutes, and when it does, it is a pale comparison between it and the original design. Overall, blood fever avoids impressing. It may be worth a watch once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.
