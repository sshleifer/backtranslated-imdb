Obviously, for this movie, they would have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story tells you that you do not like the new protagonists. Over-flying the island and the dinosaurs under no influence at all and almost resembled a cartoon. The only action entry to the island is just a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story is predictable for the annoyance and it is totally unsatisfactory and I have felt cheated. This gave me without the opportunity to award the film 3/10!
