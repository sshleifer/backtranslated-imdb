"A scientist has developed a serum that roughly distorts the victim's hands and heads. The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure and take the man's daughter to a wife," according to the DVD's synopsis. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in the low budget Bela Lugosi fashion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly," which American Heritage defines as "An adult chronic disease characterized by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face and jaw caused by the pituitary overactivity." Ralph Morgan (like Anthony Lawrence) plays the needy man with some dignity. Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (like Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter wanted by wild researcher Naish; In early scenes, Ms McKay and Naish Emote fun. <br /> <br /> Look for Tala Birell (like Maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; She plays the somewhat Garbo-like, and long-suffering, assistant to Naish. Ms Birell definitely steals the movie; and you have to ask questions to Dr. Markoff's beauty by throwing her aside. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and a crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) adds to the fun. Monster Makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
