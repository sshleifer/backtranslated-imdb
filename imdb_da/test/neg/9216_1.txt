I remember seeing many years ago. It had a fairly promising start with an interesting premise, but then it quickly turned into nonsense. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and excitement, and slightly simplified philosophy thrown into everything that culminated in a horrible ending. <br /> <br /> It's just the trash. <br /> <br /> Before I watched this TV movie, I didn't think I would ever have any movies that I thought were the "worst" I had ever seen, but when I finished watching this, From then on, if anyone asked me what the worst movie I had ever seen, I could say without hesitation - "The Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
