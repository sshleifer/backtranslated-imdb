Once again, I seem to be the only person on the planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fire on the Plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of " classics "who get every possible praise without seemingly good reason. As much as I love to over-generalize and psychoanalyze all those movie guests who have such a terrible taste in movies, it is still almost impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that badly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as a kind of "masterpiece" . What I find really ironic is that fans of derivative "classics" such as "Fire on the Plain" focus so much on "inside the box" film making (Orthodox classification standards such as scriptwriting, acting, camera work, etc.) It always looks like that the most respectable "classics" are most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the craziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal display, where characters essentially explain everything to the viewer, even when the constructed scenario is completely artificial. Most surprisingly, the very first scene in "Fire on the Plain" uses this incredible tactic to the fullest. <br /> <br /> After a fun head-start, the following useless dialogue strikes: "Why can't you understand the situation? We landed west under heavy fire to strengthen the units in Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was lowered in transit, we tried to reach the Burau airfield by crossing the central mountains, but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy counter attack forced a fanout over the valley. You know. "So why is just a sign telling a another sign that he already knows? Oh yes, that's right, the film's decision makers are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality film would actually show these events, or in the worst case, it would involve dialogue with a character who is unaware of these events. Heck, even an opening review in piece form aimed at the viewer would have been better than what happened here. <br /> <br /> Such poor quality filmmaking cases are filled throughout "Fire on the Plain" to the point where this movie feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the protagonist stumbled upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese carpet. Instead of doing the natural thing like ?? oh i don't know ?? gives a depressed manic, rash character "Japanese soldiers." Thank you, but I could have figured one out for myself. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this movie is full of over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Imagine this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn boots. It is believed that such a finding is completely useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he puts up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots. Well, I get points. The soldiers are in rough shape? a fact that is already clearly highlighted with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go until the other soldier arrives! You see, he finds the former soldier's SUPER-worn boots and messages ?? get ready, because here it comes ?? that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots. But you see, that's not all ?? because the third soldier arrives! He finds former soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. As both couples suck, he throws them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point, I was ready to throw my television through the window of my window. The high enforcement, overdramatism and the overall absurdity of this sequence are beyond poor filmmaking. It is SUPER DUPER bad film making. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, quite stupid moments to have. Like the time when the protagonist asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" Just as the guy answers "Yes" if he actually kicked the shovel. I will also be the first to condemn the primary actor's entertainment, who is the quintessential poster child for artificial reaction. I laughed hard under the open head, where his head snuck in place with this stupid, greasy expression on his face. The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an 8.4DDb average rating while a certifiable masterpiece such as "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003) gets only a 7.5 is the height of the mass's stupidity. And to think that some people actually deceive themselves into believing that "AToTS" doesn't make sense. Well, not all movies can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on their side.
