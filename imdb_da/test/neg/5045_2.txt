You know the flushing market where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever it is, and is he really trying to stay away from spitting it up in the sink? It is a great metaphor for this movie. I was watching, even though it was really difficult. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a slight fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The principle is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, Gargoyle has returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in poor dialogue and less than enthusiastic action by the human leaders. The best actor is made by CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie feels like a poor man Van Helsing. If you check your brain at the door, it can get you through a sad Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
