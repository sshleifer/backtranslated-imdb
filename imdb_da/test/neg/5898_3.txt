I rented the DVD in a video store as an alternative to reading the report. But it's just about more terror. <br /> <br /> While the movie can provide some information from the report in the drama, you take the word of the producer - there is no reference to the commission report anywhere in the movie. Not one. <br /> <br /> The action around is pretty bad - pretty much all the stereotypes of "hot shot" bitchy wicked oral government agents, each of whom think they know more than anyone else. There may be a truth to it, but it really has a bad Hollywood stereotype smell to it. <brD> IMDb's user community ratings and comments tend to be more right than wrong, and I have started looking at pre-hire reviews whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I wish I had this one.
