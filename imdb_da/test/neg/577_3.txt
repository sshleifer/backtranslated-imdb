I have to be honest, I like romantic comedies, but that wasn't what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the biggest part, which should have been because I didn't like the two fighting bed partners. It was awful. Bad Tom Selleck !! He had to deal with someone who was so much in the picture while it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the movie. They were the only ones credible. And the only really fun parts star them, not Kate Capshaw and the Everett guy. Cool that the mummy comes out of the closet, I thought it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I saw it on the cable and I didn't pay any money to rent it ..
