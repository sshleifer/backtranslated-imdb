I loved this movie when I was a teenager. Loved it. However, it has not grown up with me. Maybe it's because it's a melodramatic burden of old rubbish, full of macho setup, cheesy dialogue, overwhelmed slo-mo and characters that say 'Goddammit' much. The lumpy narrative gracelessly blocks from one sign to another, a plot string to another, without it ever bringing it together, and it does not help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a show is wet enough to equip any fire in the film's overlong runtime. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth looking at, but no one is really on top of their game here, and the women's folk music gets particularly short-lived. The only real influence comes from the impressive fire fighting sequences, and Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
