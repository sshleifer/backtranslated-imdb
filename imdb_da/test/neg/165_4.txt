After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chicken afterwards I found out that Keira's mother wrote the script, so it almost confirmed it. However, a chicken may have some appeal to men; This does not and really does not appeal well, even to women (looking at the poor receipts for the receipt). One topic that I believe both genders agree on is the stupidity of the scene, in the film, making an analogy between pain at birth for the pain of a limb that is amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not undergo birth pains, we understand that this is a painful process; But it is a natural pain while an amputation is certainly not! Women understand this even better. I suppose a woman tried to make a feminist statement that is in bad taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in very bad taste. Although movies today are known to have bad taste, this is really "excellent" in that department. This could have been a good movie showing Dylan Thomas' struggle during World War II; and how strong the mood was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. Keira's writer tries to show how this mood was used against Dylan, but really confuses this. Instead, we get a chick flick about how two young mothers tie together; kind of. In a way. Maybe. One way or another. It is noted that a soldier (spouse of Dylan's friend's friend) is sent home after serving in battle; but it is unclear whether the war is over !! A lot of things about this movie are also unclear; and even though I have already said that, I will do it again, as it seems to be the central motive for this mess.
