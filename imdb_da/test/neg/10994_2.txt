It seems to be a common thing in the 90s to play with clichés. Some manage to do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar does not. On the paper, the film looked interesting: the weak plot could have been rescued by great moments of comedy, dark humor and a very "décalé" style. Unfortunately, Hadmar's director kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Any joke is embarrassing as no one responds to the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to wonder what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous mascara. What could have been a stylish fun, mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
