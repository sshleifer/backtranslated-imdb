I have seen about half a dozen of the low budget poverty line B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s and I am consistently surprised at how poor an actor he was. How did he ever come to be a leading cowboy actor? They say he could drive quite well back in the sound, but he does nothing particularly impressive in these later audio films. Still, he might have the managers because he was big and could ride. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's still not much. Some of the other characters refer to him a few times as a "young trap", where it seems to me that he is as old as the other older actors. <br /> <br /> And if it's not silly enough, there is a pretty significant script problem in this movie. At one point, one of the signs makes a note of how the phantom had prevented poisoning of a well, something that had not yet happened. Just a few minutes later we see that scene. No, it wasn't a flashback. First, I thought maybe that when Treeline Films had the DVD download, they could have turned two of the wheels. But these days, film rolls contained approx. 11 minutes of movie, and the entire reversal took only about 3 or 4 minutes of peaks. Everything else was in a logical order. So it seems that it was a real continuity problem in the original movie. Maybe it's a reason why Colony Pictures doesn't last very long.
