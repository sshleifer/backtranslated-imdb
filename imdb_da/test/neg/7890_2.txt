The Emperor (Richard Haydn) dog is engaged to Johanna's (Joan Fontaine) dog. But when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna dog. After a vengeance attack, where Virgil is banned from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna dog should confront Virgil's dog so she can overcome her doggy alley. This is arranged and the dogs fall in love. The same goes for Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes by with romance and at the end Johanna's dog feet. But who's dad .......? The dog's story is the very weak vehicle used to try to create a history between people. It's a horrible story. There are 3 main pieces of music that are all bad - bad songs and horrible choreography. It's just an extremely boring movie - Bing has too many words in every sentence and delivers them in an almost shouty, annoying way. It's not fun ............ EVER .......... but it was supposed to be. Bing and Joan have done much better than this.
