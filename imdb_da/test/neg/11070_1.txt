If I could give this excuse for a movie a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to choose this DVD in the store, read the blurb and think it sounds pretty good, I will spend £ 10 and buy it. everything I got at the end of it was a £ 10 coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of a good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> The reason is basically, 7 people go into an unexplored hole, one of them is a reporter. no one else knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they cannot get out and they are knocked off one by one by a monster. There appears to be no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has some earlier demons, where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago ... there also seems to be no relevance or reason for it, just a rubbish attempt on building, I suppose? Anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy who walked into the cave like a normal kid and has lived there all his life. This gives no reason to make him superhuman who can shine, look in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in 2 places at once and gain insane strength (able to move stone blocks, carry adult men as deadweight and so on.). <br /> <br /> In the final scene, there are 2 women left alive, waking naked, just covered with a little blanket or something. They then find a picture of a child. The monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a blanket with some kind of animal skull over his head (says in the director's comment that it was a wreath skull if it would be the biggest biggest collar I've seen in my life) and quite literally goes " Raaahhh "like a kiddie on Halloween. I saw it with my boyfriend and at that time he literally burst out laughing. The guy then sees a picture of himself as a child and has a feedback to him sitting under a tree with his face burned and then rising and wandering into the cave. That's the scale of the back story, why he paints people and it makes you feel a bit cheated for a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutal rape the other, cut to end credits. I know that the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just made me a little sick and was the thing that hit me most in the whole movie. He could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her, and that would have been less terrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things left unanswered at the end. Apart from all this, the scenes where there were minutes at a time of just black and nothing else, were annoying and the constantly nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's happening, so hurt me so much at one point I almost knocked it off. An absolutely horrible movie. You might as well get the money you would spend on it and put it on fire, it would be better spent money, like a smart person who posted me said when you saw it, you can't watch it the.
