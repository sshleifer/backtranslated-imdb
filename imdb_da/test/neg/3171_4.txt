I think Homegrown is a bit misleading for this movie - more like "Plantage Grown" - but it doesn't have the same ring for it. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these rude buffoons are not my idea of ​​a stomach grin. More in the genre of the Pharisaic thriller / drama. The signs developed well enough - an all-star cast made it oh-so promising, just a shame plot was obviously absurd. Ted Danson gave a nice como, which Jamie Lee Curtis did in his walk-on part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you take a couple in advance, you should be able to sit through it - not for the wildly paranoid types.
