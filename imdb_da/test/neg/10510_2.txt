I don't really know where to start here. Just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from acting to props to history that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it says a lot because I've seen some bad ones. When I watched this movie, I knew it was a knife that knocked off, but I thought he was kung fu and vampire, a combination that I thought could not fail. That's until I popped this into my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to destroy something as cold as vampires and martial arts is beyond me. first the actor. I didn't expect much here at first because it's an action movie and a B one on it, but the play here is so bad I couldn't help but be bothered by it. Expressions and vocal tones were far out of the way, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole movie, and as it was so ridiculous, I thought I was watching Mad TV. For example, the naughty man screams Derek escaping when he has to kill master kao, who should never have been born in the first place. All in all, I've seen better acting at primary school playing. Then there is the action. not even sub par compared to the things that have been done in action cinema as of late. But still, the action was not a total failure as Ron Hall seems to involve some martial arts skills. But even the skill he has is overshadowed by the stupid things he does, for example the part of the movie where he starts spinning, and then the camera changes. I almost slipped a pillow in half. And the battle situation where his prison buddy fights for vampires by swinging their arms on them. WOW.OR What about the part of the prison where Derek suddenly knows magic and can preform chants that make water from the water to the tap. and as far as the props go. The guns resemble walmart toys, the teeth were stolen from halloween costumes, and words cannot describe how bad CG graphics are. I could walk for hours on all the things that are wrong with this movie and trust me that this is just the tip of the iceberg. It's just getting a 2 because it made me laugh. Although I laughed at how badly the movie was made, a laugh is a laugh. I would say that you are free of vampire unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or plan to be tortured for long periods and will practice you
