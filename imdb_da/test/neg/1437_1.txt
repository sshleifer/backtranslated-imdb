I do not recommend you to watch this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even slightly offended, and this movie made me frustrated. It's so disgusting. And that doesn't make sense. Everything the Internet is so clich√©, and the producer obviously did not understand all the "internet rules". When you chat with someone, you can track their IP address. Really? (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Meaningless. And I didn't even see the end. I could always say "it's not sensible, it's not ..." This movie is pure crap at its best. Nice comment right?
