After reading the book "One of a Kind" a week ago, I thought "This would make a good movie, especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players". I was totally shocked to find it while watching the video store last night. I didn't know anyone had actually made this a movie. I grabbed it immediately and then with great anticipation. What a great letdown! <br /> <br /> All the exciting things about Stu Ungar were foaming quickly, and instead I got back with a biopic that could have been about anyone. Ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. That was what made him so fascinating. Why not focus on it? <br /> <br /> And talk about walking down the real truth. This guy was overwhelmed with absolutely everything: drugs, women, games, hunger, sleep deprivation. He played sports events from sunset to dawn, he would miss days as he hung in crack holes, his body was forever emigrated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat almost everyone to play cards . Now it's a story! Too much time in his childhood and personal relationships (though his ties with Vincent and his daughter were barely touched) and almost nothing about his use of drugs (which was exorbitant), his crazy games and his incredible card games abilities. Probably too late now, but I hope someone repeats this movie properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script left him just without anything interesting to say.
