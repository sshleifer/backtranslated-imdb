Okay, I admit I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to watch this movie. But it was so boring that I almost slept. Sorry, but her talent as an actress is not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented as unique special effects and CGI. Yes, for a B movie, it's not that bad. After seeing her in "Marquise" a few years ago (also a very crappy movie), I thought she would play more convincingly. But La Boum (and perhaps the James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movies with her. Is it her "talent", does she have a bad taste when choosing her movies or simply accidents?
