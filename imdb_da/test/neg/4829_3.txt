Speed, which I think is a direct copy of the Hollywood film Cellular (I haven't seen this) gives an impression of a test match that is very exciting for the first four days, but then comes in a very boring drawing at the end. I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008 on rented VCD. It's release date is October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me, I didn't know or heard much of this movie before, except there is a flop at the box office. So in this situation, when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director goes again in the trap of Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a Bhatt movie, it must be copied from another location. But now it doesn't matter to me if I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the film, Sanjay Suri is an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks he's a cook. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use of the phone. But what I also found out is now taken from the film Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mix of so many other movies, it is the future clearly. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about the movie is its pace. As the name suggests, things really happen quickly, and there is not much time to think between the scenes. But it breaks in the last 20 minutes when the film goes in traditional Bollywood style by Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very interesting. Three stories go parallel, one after another. One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of Zayed is trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of Prime Minister. These three stories are mixed naturally with each other while the film continues. <br /> <br /> But then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style have killed the film's spirit. Except for Sanjay Suri, no one else makes any impression. This also applies to Urmila, which is always promising in RGV's films. Because of this ordinary play, some scenes do not really transmit the feelings the director wanted. Eg. The scene at the end, where Urmila leaves all hope and cuts the phone, should have had a good effect. But instead, we are just waiting for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> Aside from acting, killing some unnecessary love for style film. Shows so cool villains are good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood. The background in London is also only to create style and not very intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. Especially at the end, all the dhishhum dhishhum were completely unnecessary. Must be the director has the impression that the climax of Hindi movies must have such battles. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make people leave the theater before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Over and over, I find the movie once available. If it comes on TV or you can get it on rent it is OK. But then make sure you have the remote control and the forward button handy. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can probably see other channels.
