Avoid this! It's a horrible movie. So what if it is very exciting? All it is is just meaningless murder. And everything with Thorn and Michael's curse, it was the worst thing they could do for the series! Why couldn't they leave Michael's story a mystery? He was supposed to be a Boogeyman, not a part of a stupid guy !! Ugh! Thank you for Halloween H20, which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, please wait no more than meaningless murders and doings.
