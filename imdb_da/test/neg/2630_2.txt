This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen for many years. I started watching the movie not expecting much, and that's exactly what it delivered .... not much! In fact, it ended up delivering even less than expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening parts of the movie was that I would probably end up classifying it as a "4". I thought it seemed to have a pretty good photography and a ghost mood. <br /> <br /> However, as the film evolved, the assessment continued down and down my mind primarily due to pedestrian effects and a plot that went from being simply stupid and tasteless at first to being both silly and contradictory in the end . When the film was over, I was willing to judge it no more than a "1". <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this.
