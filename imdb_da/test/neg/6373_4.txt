This was something I was looking forward to seeing. The Ultimate Avengers movie had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought the same production team could do some really good things with an Iron Man solo title. But the final film was unsatisfactory. I do not expect them to spend most of the film celebrating Iron Man's gray armor. The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. Not a big complaint, but not what I expected from the ads and box. The worse, however, was the story, the play and the cell-shaded CGI animation for the monsters and the Iron Man armor, which was not convincing. It didn't interfere well with the cell animation at all. Even on their own, it looks like stick-like and lifeless. Tony Stark's character bow, as incredibly slow as it requires, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to watch this movie because I love Iron Man, but after forcing me through the movie, I wondered if they couldn't have picked up something that had been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
