How many disaster movies can be before we get tired of them. Come on, we can see them on the Discovery channel all day long. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. The Great Predictor's grandson makes a prediction, and everyone begins to moan about how he destroys the family name. The evil sister-in-law convinces the wife to throw him into his wife's arms, which she will meet. Can you believe it? The wife wants to approve the new wife! At the same time, the wife has a person in love with her who does not have a wife, but she sends him a pack. Now that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears. <Br /> <br /> The special effects are really good, but the duplication is poor. That's why I like subtitles. The actors are all very experienced and have won many awards so you can see some of Japan's best in an often repeated story. <br /> <br /> But the soap opera story returns with a kitchy ending.
