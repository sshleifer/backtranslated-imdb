Honestly - this short movie sucks. The dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made, but still fake enough to ruin the viewing experience. The Unearted DVD is crisp and clear, and I don't think it will help or hinder it. If the film was a bit grainy, it could have added a little "creepiness factor" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype about the other than the subject - but to be honest, the necrophile scenes in movies like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this is talking about the movie is about loneliness and all other deep philosophy is bull ****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not so shocking, it's not that disgusting. If you insist on seeing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit film about necrophilia (there must definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos;) - the movie is good and it has something "gore" (if you see a rubbery Appearance doll getting cut open is considered gore ...) but apart from that - absolutely nothing goes for this overheated mess. On the other hand, GENESIS-Cerda's "successor" to AFTERMATH (now available as a "dual feature" released by Unearthed movies) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film that really shows what a good director Cerda really is when he gets the right material. Although I don't care about AFTERMATH, GENESIS is so well done that I will forgive Cerda and certainly keep an eye on him in the future ...
