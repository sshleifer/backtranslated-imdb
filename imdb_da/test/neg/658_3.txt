Compared to the recent Gore Girl HOSTEL, which this movie reminded me a lot about - I would say that Watch No Evil is a little better, but not too much. The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter prison sentence. The kids soon end up being killed by a paralyzing religious psychopath who cleanses them for their sins (I guess). The only thing I feared most about seeing this was that it stared at a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job as he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a few pretty gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a rather memorable scene where a girl gets a cell phone pushed down her throat - probably the most effective death in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can't say this movie really shows us anything new and is certainly far from good. Can't recommend it.
