Let's get one thing out of the way. I'm a big Bruce Campbell fan, I have the Evil Dead series, have action characters and have seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of cheesy, ridiculous horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole "it's so bad it's good" deal. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with high expectations, I wanted to be good, campy, something from BC, we have all come to know and love. It started promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes I lived to see the rest of this apologetic excuse for a movie, as if I had just been shot with soothing darts. <br /> <br /> The idea in itself is not a bad one; two men do not go together, both killed by the same psycho-woman, half of a man's brain is transplanted into the head of others, they argue, disagree and the comedy follows. <br /> <br /> What killed me is how extremely disorganized and boring it was! It had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was. The reason was boring, even Bruce's zany physical slap stick couldn't make it work. <br /> <br /> Word's can't even properly express the ridiculous robot that Bruce's wife's brain ends up in. Easily the worst looking robot I've ever seen anywhere (even for a B movie.) The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell went through Bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me. Why was Ted Raimi not driving to his big brother and asking him to make some sense in Bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Bruce !!!
