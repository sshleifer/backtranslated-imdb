This movie had the potential to be a good little high school thriller. Instead, we got a drill party about a whiny, spoiled brat baby sitting. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with girlfriend, random friends comes over to be killed. It was clear that they just killed time. The protagonist was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no feelings during this movie. She was right there. Another problem was that the killer was not a threat. The children survive, so it is obvious that they will let Jill survive. The only reason it got a four was that the last ten minutes (when the killer finally comes out) is actually exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
