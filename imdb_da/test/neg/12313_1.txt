Well, I guess I know the answer to that question. For the money! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and goods that we almost think there should be something good about this movie. I admit I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a try. Well, I should have gone with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Once again prove that the average person can be programmed to believe that something they say is good must be good. Apart from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it naturally started with a moth-eaten script. It's filled with unsuccessful attempts at meaningless humor and horrible pastel sceneries. It skips the whole universe without a destination or direction. This is then reinforced with, ............................ yes I say it, BAT ACTIVITY! I couldn't help feeling that I saw "Coffee Talk" at SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat supposed to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no price either, but Mr. Myers would disappear underneath a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
