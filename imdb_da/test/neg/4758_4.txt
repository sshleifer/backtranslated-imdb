This foamy romantic comedy is based on that kind of story I loved as a teenager, but now I find something uncomfortable. In the case of May-September attachments, it is undoubtedly what is in the mind of the oldest party, either the desire or the inability to meet the reality of aging or both. And the younger one is probably seeking the sweet parent that she (or he) was missing as a child. These underlying agendas seem more pathetic than me now romantic; There is also something quiet about them. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is so embarrassed at all - as much as he should - playing the older lover in this silly story. He was fifty and tried the role of a twenty-one-year-old man who searched a teenager. But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - beautiful and sour and full of vinegar - as an abusive seventeen year old presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally just and honest scriptwriter as a subject for him to study. Her lively performance made me feel better than this movie would otherwise deserve. Anne Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful but crazy fiance, and handled her small role in a full-fledged way. <br /> <br /> Part of the dialogue was also entertaining, so it's not a total washout. <br /> <br /> 5/10
