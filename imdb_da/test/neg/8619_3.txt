Although this was created as a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have aspired beyond that. Because it doesn't even strive to be a good vampire movie, VTT can't deliver any kind of battle it might have tried. <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story of the offspring she mistakenly attended (and now wiping out) reminds me of Gizmo and his situation in the "Gremlins," And that's not a good thing when it comes to a vampire girl. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and works as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of accent grates when you realize she is an 800-year-old vampire. In addition, when she tells Connor that he is "a young soul," she does not deliver the line with much of the weight one would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive but not trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more credible in her role, but for a "Dawson's Creek" alum you would think she would have more screen time. The question of whether Amanda bids and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie and you never get it. You get a tease from it, but you never get any kind of development out of the characters of the plot unit. It's a cheap way to play your audience. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, find Lugosi's "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of Flicks from Hammer with much more strength than this . Eventually, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. This is just forgettable.
