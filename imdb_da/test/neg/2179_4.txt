Perhaps this was * an important movie * and that's why people rank it so high, but honestly it's not that good. Gradually, it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably the whole of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the size of what was really happening in the ghettos, so you can't reject him too much for the interruption that affects a modern seer, but Interrupt remains. <br /> <br /> More disappointing is the movie just clunky; It's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had evolved in sophistication since the silent era. The pieces that involve both the Jewish barber and the dictator do not flow into each other; they are just sitting there as discrete clumps of history that progress and begin, move everywhere, but never come into resolution. Some are funny, slightly smaller. <br /> <br /> The charm of the movie is strictly in Chaplin's attribute. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of it all, and there is no denial that he had a physical grace that was great to see. But just about everything he had around him was ANNOYING. Hannah was also DAMN American. Storm Troopers were also DAMN American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I don't know what purpose was earned by having Garbage be the evil source behind the throne. It almost seems that the film says that if it wasn't for evil influences like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't have been so bad a guy.
