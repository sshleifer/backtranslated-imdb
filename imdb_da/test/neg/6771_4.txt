I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget movie. But the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open American eyes to the pleasant relationship between the government and the journalists who were to watch it. But on the one hand the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama. The protests in the Republican Congress in New York in 2004 were not so convincing to make a documentary about it. Such compelling protests belong to the 1960s era. <br /> <br /> It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Maybe a slow build, where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.
