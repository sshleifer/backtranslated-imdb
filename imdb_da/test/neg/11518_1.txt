I'm in a movie club at my school, and I was forced to sit and watch this stupid movie. The film's story is not gloomy, but the whole movie itself is extremely gloomy. The action was absolutely horrible. The kids were overly whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept from peace. The monkey is neither sweet nor fun. The drama is ridiculous. I can't remember when I saw a more horrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely fake. The adults are trying to be good actors, but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes. The girl even seems to leave the movie by falling from a hill under the movie to leave it, I don't blame her. Micheal Anderson should publicly apologize for this movie. Not just for me, but for everyone else who was forced to sit through this horrible movie. In fact, I apologize to you. Although I had nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this movie, for it means at least someone will. This film even surpasses the grim movie of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls. I would even go so far to say that Hilary Duff's movie collection is even worse, but it does push it. Just watch this movie, or you'll be pushed to write a review similar to that of how horrible this movie is. I am very sorry.
