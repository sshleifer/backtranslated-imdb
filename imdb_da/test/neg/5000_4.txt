Zombie movie is hot, I love them. Can not get enough. Why I wanted to buy a movie of this caliber goes without explanation, I really love zombies. Surprise, this is really not much of a zombie movie; low budget I can handle, being duped, just annoying me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror movie clich√©s stays in a warehouse / laboratory / who knows what to escape from a firefight outside. Panic, shouting, low light and (eventually) zombies follow. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the filmmakers, as it is obvious that they really thought they should put together some good; a serious, scary horror movie. It's not far from it, it's a boring mess of woodworking, cheesy FX, poor lighting, excessive dialogue and over editing. Things first go wrong when it takes a good 10+ minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what's going on. It gets worse when another 20 minutes goes by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All of this is filled with non-functioning and poor dialogue. Finally, one is attached (not by a zombie) and hopes to flicker just a touch before the characters again hang around emotions that everyone generates about how much this sucks. I also guys, I too. <br /> <br /> Finally, zombies are in the mix, but no one sees any more. I think there was some blood and gore thrown in, but I was too busy to ask for the credits to roll to notice. And when the screen finally became weak, I felt even more cheated by the pointless 'Cube'-inspired end. <br /> <br /> I will give credit to try very hard even though it failed miserably. The and punk chick was very hot if it was completely in use. <br /> <br /> Can't really recommend it to anyone, save for movie students looking for 'no-no' pointers. <br /> <br /> 4/10
