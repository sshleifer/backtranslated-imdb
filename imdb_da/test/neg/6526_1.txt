OK, first from there it can be a SPOILER here, because I don't know what it means to give too much information. My subject line says it all but surely people would like to know why it is so stupid. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie follows a bunch of Yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago, but stop taking the wrong exit and liquidation in the ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first and foremost, Emilio drives everyone in the world's most exuberant RV / Winnebago, chuckled with satellite dishes and crap on it. So these guys go to a sports game (I forget which probably bulls or the white sox, as they are close to the oh-so scary ghetto), but they can't even make it down the highway without having a boarding control center that would put ESPN to shame. Still, they are wise enough to serve livelihoods that would pay for those things, but are such sports fans that they do not even know which exit one is going on for the game they love. <br /> <br /> I gave up on the movie within half an hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. They turn up in the Ghetto, but their biggest danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A white guy I'm no racist, but come on. In some RESEMBLING reality - and this movie tried to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not try to kill Emilio Estevez, he would hitching a trip to get f *** out of Dodge himself !!! <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the stupid movies ever created, although I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema. If MST3K was still on, they would definitely have set aside an episode for that.
