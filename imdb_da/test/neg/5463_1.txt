First, the title has no relevance to the movie. It started fine with good development, but became annoying when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which just added the annoyance. There were too many pregnant breaks in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worth it. The reason never revealed who made this crime to him, although a good plot would have allowed publication. The end was nothing short of "Hi, we've run out of budget let's stop this NOW !!" ... If I had written a novel ending this way, I would empty myself. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
