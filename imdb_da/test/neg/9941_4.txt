I have read several reviews asking the question "Why was this movie made?" I found myself questioning in my mind, as the hour and twenty minute move seemed to pull near the middle, just to give the feeling that it was steaming up in the end, as it really didn't something of that kind. So, "Why was this movie made?" I think it's a good question for those who look fiercely and enthusiastically to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen to give us this strong picture of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this whole man, but I do not think Jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table. Let me ask you this question, "Does the audience need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest"? My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed. Vigorous and excited was a good documentary, but it was far from great. Jensen did a terrible job with the history and dedication of the subject. It was great to hear the songs, but gradually these songs seemed dull, overwhelming and somewhat perishable. From the opening scene, where our men sing their hearts into a dazzling snow, I knew I was hooked, but when the film evolved I lost interest. Why? Jensen never took us, the audience members, to the next level. He kept the player's level and ultimately injured the overall tone of the movie. Was it a movie about the music or about the men in the choir? The world must never know. I would like to say again that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have certainly seen hard times and how they manage it through music, but it was as if the whole men's team was a bunch of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music excellent, but it was the characters, the subjects that I didn't know about at the end of the movie. In the mix we had a 97-year-old man who still had his driver's license, we had a big man in a tub singing classic American songs, we had old men who were once the heart of their youth, we had tensions between the youth of the choir and the veteran singer, and we even had a former drug addict who had only been clean for eleven years. Has Jensen developed these interesting stories at all? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk about it (see the political man who missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to clear away the cordial moments and go straight back to interesting places he could get choir to sing. For me, the music was defined at the beginning of the movie, I wanted to be introduced and heard the stories of these individual men. They were all captivating, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the major issues in this documentary, Jensen failed to create any kind of excitement towards the end. Without ending, I felt that Jensen was dying in the lines. Instead of being brave outside the lines, he chose not to create a moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our items from point A to point B to point C without asking us to get involved in any form or form. I can see how national mood had made this film a great success in Norway, but for everyone else who looked at (ie ME) it was necessary with more. I would like to feel for these guys. I wanted to know if they were going to do well when they were traveling, or just loved being in their own city. There was no history, mostly partly for no development of the subjects. When you see modern documentaries (oddly, this movie was made in 2001), you want it to play like any Hollywood movie. You want excitement, realism and drama, unfortunately, with hefty and enthusiastic you get nothing of that kind. In general, I have to ask the question again, "Why was this movie made?" My last answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show where disturbing times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human commitment and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. That being said, Jensen showed it perfectly in this movie, but he didn't create a good documentary. When you make a film of this kind, I feel that you have to look within the group, examine the chord members and hear every one of their stories to create an end that will address your heart. The only thing that this movie grabbed was my attention when it tried to leave the room at the speed of the rock. Again I will not sound negative about this movie because the music was excellent and the men singing resulted in a sense of honesty, but I needed more. With documentary films becoming a major staple in the film society, you expect a little more than what Heftig and enthusiastically handed over to us. I want to see the reality and the people, not just another song and dance venture! <br /> <br /> Degree: ** out of *****
