Good cinema, good acting good direction ... cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be accepted by any society. Amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sell by saying it - if such an event happens ... then what? I would like to ask him if such a thing happens to your own child or your grandchild (says girl child), what should you do? I think every parent needs to pay special attention before interacting with any 60-year-old neighbor if you have one with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged or you will inspire more Nithari cases. Such acts are vicious, and villains in movies are punished. It should be the morality of history and not glorify their action or them.
