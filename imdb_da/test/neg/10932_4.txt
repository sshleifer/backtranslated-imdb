The material is poor .... The script is terrible .... It appears mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to communicate as a kick in the head. Give this one a miss .... though Yancy Butlers doesn't warm enough even in the half naked scenes to save that tripe. I'm amazed at people rave about Yancy Butler ..... given what I've seen here and in a few other things I've seen her in that she doesn't have the depth or presence to be a star ... and her Offscreen behavior will tend to indicate that she knows it too. <br /> <br /> The last thing is where was this shot? I don't recognize the externals.
