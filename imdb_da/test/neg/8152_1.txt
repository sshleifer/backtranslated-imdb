Being (something) an independent filmmaker myself, I really understand what these guys were trying to do and that sounds like a good idea. On paper. On 16mm film, however, it is terrible. I didn't realize anything was done in the mid 90s because the movie was so grainy and bad that I would have sworn this was one of the 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream. And the sound! Ugh, I don't know what kind of microphone they use to record, but it sounds like someone is going over dead leaves all over. I suppose I shouldn't judge too hard after all, how many feature films has my company put out? No one, but I would like to think that at least we will have good picture and sound quality to go with our bad acting, writing and management. A + to idea, F-- for execution.
