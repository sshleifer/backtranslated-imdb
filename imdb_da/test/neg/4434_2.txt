I assumed I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" from the title, but it's actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I know what you did last summer" with some elements of "Scream" kind, kind, and not a very good one. Apart from a couple of very entertaining song and dance figures, it's pretty awful. Of course, it has a decent budget and it is wasted on reheated residues that were not so tasty at first. A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy for not getting into a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win (luckily she doesn't look as scary as her brother), but she goes in and wins, and of course, scary guy comes after her and gets killed, then a waking game "hides the body". Of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they are waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculously plot twist. Interspersed with all this tired rehash is a couple of great numbers, especially the celebration dance number at the Simran party, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it's very colorful, it's well done and even fun and totally wasted in this horrible movie. I would much rather see an old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece of shit, even if someone has assumed that they don't have to be made available, mostly, which is a crime in itself. But not so great of a crime as this movie. I took one to the team to see this, so take my advice, don't let me bother. 2 out of 10
