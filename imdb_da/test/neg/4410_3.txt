** Can contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> An effortless South Sea islander is performed by other (Caucasian) Natives when he is kind to visit researchers Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The cumbersome scientists dig him up and find out that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. He comes to life and goes on a rampage and probably enough that Fifties boogeyman, A-Bomb, is due to this deviation. To indicate that this particular monster goes as it has a stick up, it is a ** would be superfluous. Suffice it to say that critter lumbrer together, like the movie itself, throws its enemies into some handy quicksand and gives the protagonists a thing to make stupid comments about. Paul Blaisdell created a man's suit and it is hardly his best work. Over the years, this flick has been against many comments such as "To Hell It Can Go!" Personally, I think it's the best walking-tree movie I've ever seen.
