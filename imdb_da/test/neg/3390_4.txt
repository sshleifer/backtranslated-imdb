Fans of horror comedy will like this. Others can quickly get irritated and shut it down. It is a kind of companion movie with over-the-top violence and doings, deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of fragility. It seems to be made on a budget of about $ 100, by a bunch of brothers after a big beer keg party. There is a leader who is a frustrated geek, and his high-milk prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times a second. There's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. When this thing and its gnarly-worm-worn driver appear, it's a great scene. There is a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their backseat, and lots of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck rods. Nerd's friend never turns off his yap and gets them in a mess for the other. Their arguments came to my nerves, but other aspects of the film make it. <br /> <br /> Sight gags poking fun on several "psycho pains and trying to croak any" movies are everywhere. Choose which one is the most riffed: Hills have eyes so and Jeepers Creepers were some I recognized. <br /> <br /> It's fun if you're in the right mindset. Sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make seeing this more fun; It's a good bet, it's the conditions for the filmmakers when they put this stuff together.
