The film opens with beautiful landscapes of the northwestern landscape. Fenceposts excavated from soddy land, a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance, clouds of clouds, small structures beside the road, a motel or a dinner in the middle of the sky. Above this plays a dull but mysterious Twin Peaks piano arrangement and it is all sufficient mood and atmospheric in an American gothic kind of way. Through this, however, instructor Jon Jost, along with unpleasant frames, blocks of letters, opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds, color frames announcing "BLUE", numbers that count to "12 steps to a conclusion," announced in the opening point . It is obvious in the first few minutes that although Jost is more than capable of capturing landscape and atmosphere, he does not care about it. He has no love for Pacific Northwest's open extensions, as Terrence Malick does in Badlands, and neither the time nor the propensity for Twin Peaks David Lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a particular place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is more Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose. The use of shared screen is interesting, I especially like how we get the first picture of Ricky Lee split in two, you tell childhood memories that only mean to him, the other curse and slap your head against the wall and over the race of the movie the other Ricky Lee ruler, the macho reclining hipster with shades that is hopelessly self-employed and stupid. On the other hand, the stop motion animation and selection seems to not play most of the movie in the voice-over story. It does sometimes because Jost writes as well as he shoots static shots from smalltown American Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues, delivered in the most flat nasal monotone imaginable, a voice that sounds like Stephen Hawking's computer speech program crossed with a horse whinnying, is so the grid to the ear beats that kind of purpose of trying to pay attention. Each of the couples relates us to their past experiences, their little triumphs and foolishness and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere. They say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces. But those bumps like rabbits. It seems to be their only communication channel that is open, perhaps the only one they can trust with certainty. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in the Frameup among naive and delusion, those who were frightened by an American dream became miserable, but he did not sit over them. He does not abandon or lose his portrayal. They may be misunderstood, but they are graced with the moments of humanity, awkward, even though they may be. We are called to empathize and show love instead of pointing and laughing. This is the most successful Frameup being; The movie's characters come alive, even when their expressionless faces don't, even when Jost gets in the way of his stylish framing and intrusive camera games. Then we go back to anger angry if the devastating effects of money are played over a shot of a dollar bill, we get a weird psychedelic order in which Jost's camera slides under large magazines that are soon reddened red as Beth Ann repeatedly mouse over " redwood trees "in voice-over, we even get a sudden turn to plot and genre, as the couple Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, smalltown losers with nowhere to go and nothing to hold them back to their dead-dead, arrive in California and Decide to rob a 7/11. The movie does not float to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the broken 7/11 job, which one might expect from a "par-on-the-run" road movie, it slowly creeps and you look out window to see it has not really got somewhere in particular. Parts of the trip have been hypnotic and share almost touching and fun, but everything else has been most annoying.
