I decided to watch this movie because I hadn't seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this because it is quite honest it is a dog ?? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both major actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is simple: it tries to put too much into a story of a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within a hour after meeting her. What is that cliché? Marry in haste, repent in spare time ... In short, history is a series of episodes showing the couple's deteriorating financial status, their problems with John's living mothers, their struggle to pay the bills, john's diminished status in the office, the arrival of Their baby son john jnr (unexpected and causing extra friction at home with the mother), the couple's anxiety about their marriage, the child's illness, which worsens, necessitating a heroic flight of a lone pilot (in a violent storm) to bring a particular serum to save the child, and finally John is accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. How many more cliché situations could the authors include? Maybe mother die shortly after? There wasn't much comedy; drama was, at best, darkest; The dialogue was painful to hear. Only the act of the four main players was sufficient. <br /> <br /> This was the period at the end of the Great Depression, where the United States came out of its long decline? how many people saw all the events depicted in the movie. So, did it make sense for Selznick to affirm good ol home affairs American values ​​of family, relationships, holiness, perseverance, and initiative? ? all based on the "average" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so was it planned in 1938 ?? Shortly thereafter, the United States began producing for the next World War II. Therefore, this kind of film was a great booster for the public, at that time many of whom would soon be in England at war. As many would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war. But I'm glad I saw it ?? as a piece of hidden socio-political propaganda. But I have to watch other Lombard movies to get a better understanding of her performance. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted: See this one to say you've seen all Stewart's movies; otherwise not bother.
