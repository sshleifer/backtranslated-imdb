Some people think of Sweden in a negative way: too well, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. A people tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsion. This need not be a problem for a film maker, for example, the late Bergman has shown us what can be cinematically possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity. <br /> <br /> Andersson does the opposite: He only comments on this identity and hereby dissects his people to the leg: In his world Sweden corresponds to hell on earth. But he no longer takes it, and for me it's just not art, but only annotation. Despite the extraordinary time it took to get this filmmaker to have serious limitations, he obviously can't step out. Compared to its previous movie Singer from the Second Floor / Songs from the Second Floor, there is not much progress to be made. The purpose was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes trying to please a larger audience are not the best in the movie. The same absurdism and minimalism still applies, there is one-shot camera position and (lack of) action in front of this shot. Yes, the still images are well finished, some of the scenes actually work, and the coloring and positioning are great. But does it make an interesting movie? Think in a negative way, this is the cinema taken one step backwards. <br /> <br /> Andersson's background as advertising advertisements shines through in the detailed setup, but I find his movie as empty as the advertisements. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
