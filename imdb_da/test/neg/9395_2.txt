This film was thoroughly unhealthy, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from a few great shots from Italy, there is nothing to recommend this movie. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a broken existence - the next guy you meet who you sleep with after knowing a few hours, it should be Mr. Right. As for humor, there's something in the movie, but I can't see how anyone might feel this a romantic _ comedy_ since about three quarters of the movie is totally depressing! My recommendation? Run it in the theaters, wait until it comes out on DVD, then jump it too. I want someone to give me back the two hours I wasted, and look at this boy, drifting, dross.
