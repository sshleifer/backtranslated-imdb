I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free naked. So why didn't I like this movie? No movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not the SE7, let me just laugh. Maybe it's me, but I've never felt frustrated about watching American Pie movies or other more modern National Lampoons movies. This movie has no power that keeps me smiling and waiting for what's next. Instead, I find myself stopping to think, "Why did they keep that scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you wait for Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I had seen on this movie, guess what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generous.
