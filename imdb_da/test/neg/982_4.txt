To restore "Lost Horizon", there was a musical need for a musical composition of Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. That said, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon" is his score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the play. The cast is made of most non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, were all called and still don't sound that big). Frankly, the novella, where this and the former non-musical film versions were based, is at best mediocre. While the possibilities for a really good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film succeeds in being a good, rainy vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise, you are better off buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece because of the movie's horrible reputation. I've seen much better; but I have seen much worse.
