Maybe I expected too much from this movie, but at least a comedy should be fun and this has very few funny moments. It manages to be insulting to homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, the obese and probably several other groups as well. The stage of graduation, where everyone is claiming to be gay, is one of the most palatable I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously miscast and Kevin Kline seems confused most of the time. <Br /> <br /> Other reviewers compare the movie to "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ funny.
