With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB functions as a low-grade scare, but as a great follow-up statement to the original, it floats miserably. <br /> <br /> Things are starting to come out promising during phone opening credits. We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary brought into Castevette's apartment and fell into shock (the tool turned out to be out of the hardwood floor); and Bramford's emptiness without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard from the previous film's dialogue). It is also interesting to be Easter hunting the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black). When history rolls, it never really rolls ... And what happens to Rosemary when she steers the driverless bus and is whisked away to God - know where? Patty Duke, Ray Milland and Tina Louise (like the Southwest Whore traveling the child, "Adrian / Andrew") are leading this almost star cast with Ruth Gordon replaying her "Minnie" role. Although it was not a total failure, this successor of the varieties had to be released in book form first, so perhaps everyone could have been a little better informed ... and not left completely in the dark. A fairly recent successor novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate follow-up of Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
