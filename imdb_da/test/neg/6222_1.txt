I do not know where most of you were in, but where I saw the film, we did not have people singing as some have said they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly on campy plot line, the terrible dances sequences and songs of this kind Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be excited about the movie were the seventy-generation people who were some how to revive the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the 70's and even went to the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September of 79, so I appreciated them and I do it now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so badly staged, duplication and editing are horrible, and this must be Meryl's worst production. I can't believe an academy prize winner would stop as low as doing this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
