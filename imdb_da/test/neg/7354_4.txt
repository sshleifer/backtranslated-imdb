What could have been some great, cruel things end up being an incomprehensible, nutty movie that even the filmmakers themselves didn't understand. Had they shown more of the satanic ritual or anything, it could have been more scary, but as it stands now, it is a waste of time and brain cells. Does anyone get sick of the whole "little child drawing crazy pictures with crayon" stuff? Could there be a larger horror clich√©? Probably not. I know I know it is from another country and it is far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand so I should not expect the "plot" to happen to me, blah, blah, blah. No matter what. I'm still saying the movie is blowing.
