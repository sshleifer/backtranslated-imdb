I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I would at least like this movie. Also I am Canadian, and this is a presumably Canadian movie, so I was prepared to cut it a little seriously. Nothing could have prepared me for the "airborne" waste. Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The action in the whole movie was so bad I have trouble sleeping tonight. I now only have two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to sit through this movie. 2. I wish I could get them back 6 hours. Oh wait, the movie is under 2 hours - it was only 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't look here. Seriously.
