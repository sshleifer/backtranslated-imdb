They call this movie "euro trash horror". <br /> <br /> Well, that's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, yes yes, it is "euro". Trash? Oh yeah, it's bad. <br /> <br /> You know you're part of a great movie when the DVD at the start gives you text on the screen, apologizing for the quality of the print you are having. Expect crackles, odd pieces, and the movie does not fit the screen. Plus there is the sound - first I thought I saw a dubbed movie. Then the lips looked carefully, I realized, no, that is that the sound quality is embarrassingly poor and out of sync. The plot itself is pretty greasy - an old, disfigured woman named Dr Bannister kills a researcher for her youth formula. I do not give much away because when you see the "old woman", it is quite obvious that she is under a layer of thick, badly used makeup. Anyone with a lick sense, sees the false old age, knows what's coming next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old crown" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with face makeup and a long wig hair! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I think she has the cornflakes glued to her face. The film makes no attempt to explain how cornflakes came there. For that matter, there is no attempt to explain anything whatsoever to any of the characters. They have never been developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two police officers who pursue our rule just walk, apparently baffled by the simplest tracks. The murdered scientist worked on a youth serum, the old woman has disappeared, and we continue to run into a young woman - how do these pieces fit together?! What does it all mean? One of the police sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth. The other smokes a tube. It's pretty much everything we get, characteristic. <br /> <br /> Dr Bannister (the crown, now a beauty) walks around wearing weird costumes and then takes them off so we can see her flesh. She has affairs with men. She comes in disaster with a young woman in a nightgown. She goes to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She walks a little, then takes out her wet color to reveal a strange pearl-curtain bikini. She takes her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease. The end? Well, without giving anything away, it's just a bizarre, thanks to conclusion that only makes little sense like the rest of the picture. That's the kind of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4:00 am and says, "Quick! We need an end to our movie! What is going on now?" <br /> <br /> The author mumbles something half-awake and the director runs with it. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Some of the music is campy and fun. The classic 60s organ music that is so corny is enough to make you laugh aloud. There are some odd seduction scenes, bizarre dialogue, greasy moments. <br /> <br /> It's very close to being so bad, it's good. I managed to see it from start to finish without swallowing my eyes or sneaking. I think it's praise of a kind. '
