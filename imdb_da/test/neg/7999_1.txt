Anyone claiming that this movie should be a ninja-classical movie should have seen this movie before the mid-nineties, or he was less than 10 years before he saw it. Otherwise, I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes in this movie are just unacceptable. Instead of casting Franco Nero as a ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artists instead. In any way, the working skill is not important in such films. Nero's fighting opportunities are hardly any street fighter in a bar. His kicks and strokes are lame. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of old action movies with good action. It's just a waste of time.
