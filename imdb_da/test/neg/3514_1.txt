I have to start by saying that this is one of the most annoying movies I've seen in my life! Annoying factor number 1: Never see the "son" face (for the whole movie). And the infinitely more annoying factor: The incessant ringing phone .. Nothing but listening to the phone ring again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again ... you get my point. The old man was harassed, but VIEWER was too! In the beginning, the film was interesting to me, but it deteriorated very quickly. The movie may have been good as short, but it was certainly not enough to maintain something that is approaching film length. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the message of racism (which finally got a look at the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary to this old man being harassed. Who cares to sit and see what really is nothing but an old man spitting obscenities on someone who pranks calling him ?? If you've never seen a movie just coming under your skin and running you CRAZY ... check this out!
