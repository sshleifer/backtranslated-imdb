Why, oh why, is this garbage considered to be a classic? I've seen higher body numbers on episodes of The Simpsons. There is virtually nothing in this movie, and much of the running time is filled with almost unbearable melodrama right out of a low lying soap opera. The Trenton family goes through hard times, and when Dad is gone Mom and little boy go to get the car fixed. But when they come to the ranch they discover that the watchdog has become sour. The rest of the movie is just the ones sitting in the car while the dragging st. Bernard circles them over and over again. <br /> <br /> For the baby, I've never seen a more annoying child in a movie of my life. And of course, he is quite Aryan, as blond-haired and blue-eyed children, as it featured on packages of Kinder chocolate, seem to be more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me. All he does is cry and gnaw. The same goes for mommy. She comes out of the car, she comes in the car, she comes out of the car, she comes in the car. <br /> <br /> I know this was made in 1983, but I was just sick of the death of horror movies, where characters do stupid, illogical decisions. If Mom just used some sense, she could get away from the icky dog. It is very poorly written and there is zero voltage. If you want to see a good "evil dog" movie, check out John Lafia's Man's Best Friend. It is fun, inventive, has a better dog, a higher body count and a more involved story. Leave this waste.
