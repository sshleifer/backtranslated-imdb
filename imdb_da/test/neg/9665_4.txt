We picked this up as part of a Brentwood set, titled "The Broken Skull." Directly pushed to video with varying sound and light quality, this movie wins with a hyperactive quality that can inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "Evil Dead" kind of way. </ br /> <br /> Without going into spoilers, what is first shown to be a simple revenge, the ghost story is becoming increasingly confused and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect will probably leave you scraping your head and saying "Honey?" <br /> <br /> This is a very, very crazy movie. The Gore effect ranges from full-blooded headers to a stupid Video Toaster effect that needs to be frozen in order to be (dis) believed. The "Fangoria" level of outbreak effects in this movie is truly amazing and should probably please gorehounds while someone with a weak constitution feels a little on the cool side. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also a very noisy movie. It not only has surrounding sounds (trapped by the mikes and not replaced in the mail), but it is very screaming. No, no, I mean a lot. Very very! Draw scream, bless, howl and scream, chitter and laugh maniacally. Lower your volume if you appreciate your eardrums and your nerves! But you can't fail for their enthusiasm, they really eat the scene and sometimes the effect is quite entertaining. In particular, the actress playing a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto. In fact, very few of the actors were wood. Some of them may have exaggerated a little (oh, just a good smithy!), But most are definitely fun to watch. Cast is ethnically different and kudos to the filmmakers for it. However, the two middle-aged white women are two of the most spiked, enchanted characters since the shopkeeper in the MST3k classic "The Brute Man." Just watch them seethe on all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Headcrusher can't become a horror icon on par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even Leprechaun), but we can certainly say this ... this was a movie.
