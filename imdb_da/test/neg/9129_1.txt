Dear reader, beware! This movie is not really a movie, even though its creators are scary to call it that. If you have not been warned about the content, it goes here: the movie is simply a sequence of performances that are constantly flowing and trying to convey a particular emotion concept. They could therefore be called symbols. The pictures are accompanied by a soundtrack, it aims to create atmosphere as well. However, the images chosen by the director can only convey emotions to an American audience because they are in an overwhelming number of American icons. Although the film is intended to express the idea of ​​"civilized warfare", it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is far too long and tiring, and I felt strongly that many scenes did not have to Do with "war" in whatever form it is. Eventually, I was very disappointed with a documentary that is not a documentary, a movie that is not a movie, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of imaging technology.
