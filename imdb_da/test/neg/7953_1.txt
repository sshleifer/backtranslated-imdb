Maybe you should be a former hippie to fully appreciate it, because unlike some dated fashion, music and dialogue, it has nothing to do with it today. <br /> <br /> Four fun-loving college art students enjoy carefree days painting nude models and riding motorcycles. They take acid in a scene and go to a zoo. A sign flashes on the screen saying: "Do not feed the animals" and suddenly they are in a cage laugh and hang from a chain deck turn (?!) An evil artist (Larry Swanson) tells (in flashback) how his art career became Almost destroyed due to a paralyzing hand disease. He sends out zombie towels dressed in black to kidnap people, then inject them with a serum that distorts their faces. He tries to create a new form of abstract action (I guess here, the given details are a little unclear, to say the least). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) sets out to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) is killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) is kidnapped. I thought the zombie make-up in ZOMBIE LAKE was horrible, but wait until you see it here! It is by Douglas Hobart, the star of the Death Course of Tartu. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, the director of Z-classic BLOODFREAK, which is much, much more comfortable than this deadly turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Useless trivia note: The 1984 Regal video release features the wrong cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
