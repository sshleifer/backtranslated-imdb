The movie quickly comes to a large chase scene with ever-increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is that the captain Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp at Seagal's drive, but it would probably have completed the whole premise of the movie. It seems they decided to make all sorts of changes to the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action and don't expect a coherent plot. Transforming any sense of logic you may have will reduce your chance of getting a headache. <br /> <br /> I hope Steven Seagal is trying to move back to the type of character he portrayed in his more popular movie.
