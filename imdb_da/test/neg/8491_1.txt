Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became Edge City's hero and found the Nordic god of evil, Loki's mask. The mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for his originality and just plain fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. PARTY. Why? Cuz I'm going! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie "The Mask's Son." Someone asked Director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he answers "Cuz I'm going!" Unfortunately, this answer does not cover it, because after seeing the mask's son, I still left the theater idea, "Good Lord, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous movie have to realize that the answer to why you are making this movie should not be as simple as answering the debate about whether to celebrate or not. <br /> <br /> The mask's son begins with the Otis dog to find the infamous mask and bring it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a giant animator who sticks like a turtle tour guide to the animation company he strives to draw a day for. On the night of the company's Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the crooked, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home and still masks and thinks a child with his wife. Nine months later, chaos occurs as the baby born of the mask has remarkable comics. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and participates in the Tom and Jerry type chaos to get out of the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask after his father, Odin's order. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must admit that I respect that this film pays so much tribute to the classic comics like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with their Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dance vocabulary type of plot. However, this reverence cannot save the movie and makes it less respectful and wasted time. The premise of the movie is becoming increasingly stupid. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie silliness becomes the point that is just annoying. The signs are not fun to see, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the character can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the biggest things about the original is that although computer animation was of course used, so much dependent on Jim Carrey and his bubbly style just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that's obvious when you see him wearing the mask, and his facial features rarely change. Baby and dog were mostly animated, which became more and more distracting throughout the film. The Sidi story of Loki, who searched for the mask, became more and more stupid. <br /> <br /> The mask's son is a sad sad state. What I suggest is that you rent or buy the original mask and thank the Norwegian gods, or anyone, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel to my victim as I continue to ask the infamous question "why?" The mask's son gets a star even though that star has to split between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be in my book mask.
