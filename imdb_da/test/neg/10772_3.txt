After reading the books and seeing 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> Seymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy should be a seemingly voluntary aristocrat when he is Percy, and witty and clever <br /> <br /> when he is Pimpernel, but here he just looks bored as < br /> Percy and means Pimpernel. Marguerite should be the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and contagious matron (she sees the Middle Ages, probably due to <br /> <br /> poor makeup). Richard E. Grant has done much better things and <br /> <br /> Elizabeth McGovern's plays are uninspired and flat. The white and <br /> <br /> dash of the books and Andrews / Seymour movie is here replaced by brawn and flashy editing that just doesn't make the clip. <br /> <br /> I can add it to someone who hasn't seen any previous version <br /> <br /> or read the book, it would look good.
