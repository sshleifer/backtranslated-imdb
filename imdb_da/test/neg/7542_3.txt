Apart from the fact that this movie was made (I suppose it seemed to be a good idea at the time when BOTTOM was so popular), the only thing that confused me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was what happened to lighting? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this movie at all, and I saw it on network TV, so it was not the case of seeing a risky tape. In fact, the film was shot so dark that it was impossible to see what hell was going on. But if the dialogue was something to go with, it might not be a bad thing
