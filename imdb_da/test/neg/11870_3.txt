I am from Romania ... and for that I apologize if my English is not that good. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipe's movie, but one is horrible. I'm sorry I spent over 3 hours downloading this movie. There are many mistakes in the movie. Eg. Is the stadium in the movie not Lia Manoliu. The stadium's name is Ghencea. The football team name is Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium scoreboard is unable to display graphical images: video replays, live pictures, etc. It is a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. Uli (Seaua) team's opponents appear on the scoreboard as Din (probably from Dinamo Bucharest - who is Steaua's biggest rivals in the Romanian football championship). The images from the football match are from a battle between Steaua Bucharest and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look it up on the internet and you will see why). Police cars in the movie are not properly made. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They're all white! "Error list" can continue and on and on ... but I want to stop here! In short, this movie is horrible. It's not worth renting it, it's not worth buying a movie ticket for it, it's not worth downloading it! Honestly, I honestly realize that Wesley Snipes played in this movie. An earlier movie of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... was OK, but it's terrible!
