One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer fan. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that was great for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent so much money making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They have certainly not used it on the script for one thing, since the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and carrying one or two quiet chuckles, you are most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slumber it in a particular transparent film at the exact moment when his star profile began to rise. <br /> <br /> A sequel to Jim Carrey's comedy Bruce Almighty, this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter (Carrell) moving up the ladder to the main player's slot. The story opens with him, leaving the news agency to become a public official and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic sons (a little weird primary school, spiritual middle school and youth friend). Evan's command to change the world through politics, however, gets a key in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark. In other words, it is an update to the old Genesis story, with Evan fighting for cynicism and naysayers to build the huge boat. Unfortunately, it is not many laughs, while the assumption is reasonably promising. It is a bit of fun to be in the early times when Evan's straight-laced MP tries to juggle the demand for public service with the unwelcome packs of animals following him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it, but then Soon as he accepts his divine mission, the film takes a nosedive. From this point it becomes a message movie. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity, and Morgan Freeman continues to turn up to offer good wisdom while gently supplying his choice in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance, the only trace of comedy comes back in the form of a couple of wastewater faeces and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's enchanted right hand. Higgins can show the same rich comic potential he previously did in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel, especially as Carrell has everyone, but poses his formidable improvisations on the back burner. <br /> <br /> In some respects, it resembles a little of Christ's passion, but unlike Mel Gibson's film, which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood flow and blasphemy, Evan Almighty tries a more gentle approach. The film just tells us that we must have faith in God because he has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as Passion is. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes do not exist, and Wanda Sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. It can be sweet, but someone just hit $ 175 million overboard.
