Douglas Sir's initial "women's image" laughs at Universal, based on a preaching, dogmatic, didactic novel by the unacceptable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of the second beloved piece of crap, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to the star, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy who is worth earning millions who are more interested in hunting skirts and racing speedboats than in completing his medical degree. In the first scene he destroys his boat on a lavishly photographed lake. The accident nearly kills Merrick and therefore he requires a rather mysterious "revival machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, the beloved surgeon is Dr. Phillips finally died from a heart disease. As the local hospital can only maintain a resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so that the lice can live. When Merrick learns about this, he tries to make excuses for Phillips' family, especially for the widow (Jane Wyman, coiffed and dressed in matronly hauteur), but actually everyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits on Merrick as a brace of cobras . A doctor at the hospital's staff even calls it a "total waste" that the playboy lived in place of the christian-like surgeon. Hippocrates may have had something to say about it! <br /> <br /> These early scenes are where you will find the typical Sirkian iconclasm: The conductor rubs our faces so much into the unpleasant middle class in the mid-century America, one finds himself rooting for wastrel playboy to put white pillow under these moral hypocrites. But unfortunately no: the novel's risible plot must continue, and Merrick soon finds that he is being converted by God, in the form of pipe Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even better painter. (Why don't we see any of this amazing art?) We learn that the unbearably ubiquitous Dr. Phillips would often refuse payment for medical care (though just qualified for these "grand exemptions", it is never clear). This should give our hero a whole new perspective on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make the whole sound very illegally exciting: "When you start this thing, there's no way out of it! It's an occupation ... A great obsession!" So Merrick tries it by bothering the widow with excuses, but somehow he gets her hit by a car. She loses her vision. Apparently, Merrick will have several more stations to pass by before he can be considered a decent guy. <br /> <br /> However, Sirk continues to sneak in his reenges even though the film is growing increasingly preachy. The most obvious part should be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the main hospital nurse and Wyman's friend and pristine lesbian lover. Notice the disappointment at Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows to save Wyman's life close. Hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at that time, is also used to great irony. He and Wyman - dowdy and fifteen years older - generate absolutely zero erotic warmth in their scenes together, which by the way are purposeful few, presumably because more scenes between the stars would hopelessly reveal the entire company. (One thing we feel confident about if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something was definitely not Jane Wyman.) It's a chronic case of tea and sympathy. Sirk seemed to enjoy aligning everyone's noses by having this gay actress - who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era - running coolly through these exquisitely colored "women's images". In fact, the director has worked with Hudson 6 or 7 more times to get the best effect in following up this movie, * All That Heaven Allows *, which responded to Hudson with Wyman, but was also accompanied by a realistic plot. In * Obsession * we mean in the meantime that God / Kruger looks good from an observation window to Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life with a musical score of rising vocals from a cheesy Hollywood. -choir. <br /> <br /> But to see why Sirk is considered an author, check out the scene where Wyman explains to her adult daughter that she can actually tell the difference from night and day. The whole frame is black, here: The daughter is hardly visible, and Wymans face is slightly silhouetted against a dim light. She continues to say she hates at night because "I know Dawn never comes back". An amazing, chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
