* Warning: 1 small inappropriate spoiler * You're right. These were no bridges in Madison County. As soon as the lone woman and Richard Gere checked into the large empty hotel, it was a foregone conclusion, something funny would happen. The question is: how is it going to happen? The answer is some stupid connection dots story that is not worth sitting through. In a presumably binding experience, they become full and clean out of old cans. (It was my spoiler.) And the next day they put them back. LOL It wasn't convincing at all. I'm an old married lady like the one in the movie, and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with Richard Gere. LAUGH OUT LOUD. . . It had that advantage. You go away and go, oh brother. . . Even I could have written something more credible than that. I think my life is not as boring as I thought it was if I could scoff in a romance with Richard Gere. LAUGH OUT LOUD! And that friend inherited the all-modern, probably computer-generated mansion, half the sea, from her GRANDMOTER who built it after the civil war ??? Perhaps her grandmother is Oprah, and it was WAY after the Civil War? And yes, where was the email? What alternative universe do these people live in? I will never see another movie pretending that we do not have email and facebook and subtitles. And OK, maybe these people have a terrible reluctance to deliver news over the phone, but don't ask me to believe in anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just falls into your life without calling first.
