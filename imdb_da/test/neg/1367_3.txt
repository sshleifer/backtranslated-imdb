"Satan's Brotherhood" is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with Father Charles Bateman (like Ben) running out west with his beautiful blondes: delicious Ahna Capri (like Nicky) and daughter Geri Reischl (like K.T.). Things get windy and breathtaking for the trio as they approach the town of Hillsboro, which is seized by a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When the fragile travelers hit Hillsboro, "action" changes to the movie's more interesting collection of characters: townies L.Q. Jones (like Pete, the Sheriff), Strider Martin (like Doc), Charles Robinson (like Jack, the priest) and Alvy Moore (like Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon everything will be very stupid and predictable. Mr. Martin is stand-out (as you might expect); he considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a "cock-and-bull story", but is (of course) their leader. "Come in, kids" ends are puzzling; unless it was the movie's original title.
