I don't want to seem too much of a nitpicky spoil sport, but if a butterfly's accidental death of sometime travelers caused such a big change in the timeline, how could it be, since the butterfly would have been burned by pyroclastic blast in the erupted volcano anyway ? And how could time travelers continue to go back to the same moments and not meet with their former and later ones, who were also in the same few minutes on the timeline? It seems that there would have been quite a large crowd standing in front of the dinosaur charge. <br /> <br /> While I can accept the idea of ​​a time wave, I seriously doubt that the wave would have caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all changes that would have taken place would have occurred at the same time during this wave. Then scrape the idea of ​​the city beginning to be overgrown with jungle. And why the jungle at all? The location of the city would still have been on latitude and longitude, it was before, and would have had vegetation appropriate to its geographical location on earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical inanities. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This flick is a strange combination of some pretty decent production values ​​and completely ridiculous plot holes and actual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. A great story idea that was hit with stupid science. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all this money on production and not even disturb the proofreading manuscript to see if it made a kind of sense?
