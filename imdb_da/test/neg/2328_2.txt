I had made great hopes on this David Lynch, which I really like, movies, but the very poor who act by everyone, but Naomi Watts was the first clue that this was a wasted effort. Some Twin Peaks characters are reused in this movie, but it was not scary, it was not interesting (except the topless Watts scenes) and the quirks were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'd probably give Lynch another chance, but the hype around this movie just doesn't block, especially for those of us fans who saw Eraserhead when it first came out.
