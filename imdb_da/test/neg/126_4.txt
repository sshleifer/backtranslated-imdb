Well worth entertaining the value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This is equipped with the usual car gates, struggling with the great Van Damme kicking style, shooter with the 40-hole source and even terrorist bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled, but there is nothing that really blows you away if you have seen your share before. <br /> <br /> The reason is interesting by including a rabbit that is clever but hardly deep. Many of the characters are highly stereotyped - the angry veterans, the frightened illegal aliens, the crooked police, the indifferent feds, the bitch's tough lady station manager, the crooked politician, the fat federal, resembling that he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood -film from the 1940s. All passable acted but again nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well-behaved. At the end of the movie, you certainly knew who the good guys were and were not. There was an emotional elevator as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplified, but then you didn't expect Hamlet, didn't you? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to the CEO's daughter during the last battle scene. Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.
