This is a bad movie. It can't be denied as much as I want. Tommy Lee Jones is about as good as possible with the script they gave him, and he had a few decent action sequences that really felt out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line someone figured out that all the flaws in the script could be countered if they were to employ every workhorse actor in the company, unfortunately even really deeply talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon , Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and for not forgetting Mr. Jones himself, he cannot correct the tree dialogue and plot progression that went completely nowhere. In fact, at some point I looked up, so sure the movie had been running for the last 2 hours to find out I was 51 minutes into it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful point in the movie was the plot of the ghostly soldiers who seem to be small to no help in history. Except for a little, the confusing business in the end detracts from the picture. * If you haven't seen this movie, disregard this previous statement that may seem tantalizing and know it's not, then you don't understand it better after watching the movie. The most interesting thing about this movie might be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Fangers" with Alec Baldwin in the same role as Tommy Lee Jones carries in this movie. I may have to see it now, first to see if it's as bad as in the electric fog, and secondly because I can't think that (no matter how hard I try) break my husband in love with Alec Baldwin.
