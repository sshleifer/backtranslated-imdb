This gawd-horrible piece of tripe is everywhere. Scripture is bad, the plot is bad, the play is bad. There are a few decent players in it (Charles Durning, for example), but the director got nothing out of them. The baseline has Santa, feels rejected and thinks no one needs him anymore, takes a little girl across the country to try to get her father back with his mother. It includes a king in a Christmas gift with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by Isaac from The Love Boat), the world's largest river (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on Christmas Eve, and a sled race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it is worse on the small screen. If you see this movie coming up next, run, don't go to your television and unplug it. Perhaps you can boil the television to remove any remaining infections. If you accidentally see more than 10 minutes of this, you may need to burn your television and the cable company installs brand new lines.
