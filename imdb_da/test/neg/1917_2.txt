****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie stunk. Let me just say that I fully agree with what carissaphillips might say about this. What did Sam think? She was with a guy who told her he loved her (3 times in all), was extremely hot and stuck with her, even though she tried times (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to break up with him, no, cheat on him with a snobbish, ugly, spoiled, abundant jerk-lover who never said he loved her in the whole movie (oh wait, he wrote it on the wall that counts? ), leaving her in her time of distress because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who do you want to join? The only reason I sat through the whole movie was because it had Josh Hartnett in it and hoped she might die at the end. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him. The whole "your mother" thing was fun. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people say that, but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have told Sam too, she needed a good blow. How the romance started is a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other anyway, so I don't understand how they came together. "I was thinking of the cheeseburger sandwich you gave me ... it had mustard or mayonnaise or ....." oh what you got on. The allegedly romantic lines were so stupid. Plus he's socososososososo UGLY! I must admit I was crying in this movie. For a long time, really hard. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried in this movie so many times ... he tried to smile for her, but he couldn't stop the tears. He cried 1) He told her he loved her 2) She got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and he saw how happy she was with him 4) she died. I shouted when he was crying because he loved her all her life and told her, and yet she was stupid enough not to care about and love a guy who left her in her time of need and who was not at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars only because I love JOSH HARTNETT! Oh by the way Chris Klein, your mother! -Wiley sis
