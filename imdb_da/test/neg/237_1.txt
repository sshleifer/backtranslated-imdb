Robot vs Aztec Mummy was one of the silliest and least credible movies I've ever seen. O.K, I can buy that woman in the movie is a reincarnation of a virgin sacrificed to an aztec god. What I can't buy is the incredibly false looking mummy and the even worse looking robot. When you want to watch a movie like this, you'll see lots of fighting. But the robot and the mummy are fighting for about a minute's total! Probably the worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
