Mummie's curse is the last in the series of Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run dry when they made it. Kharis and his friend Ananka both end up in the bayous of Louisiana, and by his resurrection, he seeks out his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana is not entirely clear, but with different people trying to find them, the viewer can be sure of some mummy murders. <br /> <br /> The mum's curse was visible, but it really wasn't. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I had seen this before. Frankly, apart from the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, the Mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors. They are not bad, but they are a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some amazing scenes in the movie (the scene with Ananka comes alive in the swamp for example), but generally it didn't do much for me. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if you want to be complete and see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you might pass it on.
