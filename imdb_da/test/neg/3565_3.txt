This is an incredibly boring, slow moving movie. We can feel sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced and unpleasant Tomek, but Magda's motivations are quite difficult to see and the end, at least for me, was uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about how we all need love, but I want to get more out of a good Busby Berkeley. I am told that comments must be at least ten lines, so I would add that in the background are some interesting pictures of the relationship between Polish nationals and public employees and institutions. I wonder if it is meant to portray this before or after the fall of the Communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, look in the wise way the men from the gas company are examining whether there is gas leak in the Magda stove.
