Although it pains me to some extent that I am bothering to comment on the board of this new series - mainly because I hate to give the false impression that there is actually some kind of public interest in it - I feel compelled to Throw in my chips on this one. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, I have never before felt so convinced to mess up a TV show's fast and relentless cancellation based solely on the merits of its promo ads. And in case you wonder, I'm a guy. Listen Comedy Network: Even if your existing original programming is already, we should politely say about a "questionable" quality (I 'I'm looking at you, "Girls will be girls") you have really left yourself on this one. Anyone who green this thing could no longer get in touch with what's cool right now. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
