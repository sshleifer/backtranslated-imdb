A group of shower bags teenagers go up to an old mining hoping to find gold nuggets. The one hitch in the hairy scheme is that the old supernatural miner, to which the gold belongs, does not want to share with his treasure so easily and then begins to send interlopers accordingly. <br /> <br /> Literally clich√© budding dialogue, horrible acting, some insane horrible 'southern dialect' and a lame creepy killer resembling Jeepers Creepers (without the aforementioned love of young boys naturally) combine to make stinks almost unwatchable. Even cult playful actress Karen Black in a small role cannot save this aberration. Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
