I loved the first movie, the other one was okay, disappointed John Cleese was not jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third ... What happened to the animation ??? It looks low budget as a Saturday morning cartoon! except for the flashback taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, it just makes the rest look bad !! Derek's voice has changed, but it's not as recognizable as Jean Bob. Rogers also looks very strange. Nor do I understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie made me turn it off, as much as I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this rate. They will never beat the original! :)
