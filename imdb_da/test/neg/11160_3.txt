Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless actions will amaze, and Catholics just want to holler. <br /> <br /> Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and the ham handler by Peter Hyams, * End of Days * gets the terminator out of his open hospital dress (Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the big screen after his heart surgery) while he is blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verses to give Catholics something more to gnaw about. <br /> <br /> It's 1999, and judges around the world are in need of their computers, go fritz and lose their downloaded porn. Although the technological stench of the Y2K mutton's New York streets was ex-cop the alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the perfunctory "death-wife and child" back-story for Loose Cannon effect), brave theological waters to save 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being accused of ?? wait for it ?? Satan's Bride. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity follows. <br /> <br /> For every anti-hero there is his antichrist. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here ?? and he is celebrating as it is 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Antichrist between kl. 11 and 12 midnight on December 31, 1999 ?? ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost ?? whereby end of day is reached. Being able to read minds, induce hallucinations and apply boundless magic, it does not seem to Satan to speed up the impregnation process by showing up months in advance and directing Christine as a teenage model and then closing the threat easily at the set time. instead, he appears on December 28 as a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs ?? (See above comment re: dumbness.) Here is a movie where nothing is sensible the moment it is pronounced, let alone after considering its truth or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front of it. So wait - * Prince * is Anti-Christ? Satan Soze pursues Jericho and Christine (J and C? Get It?) Around town, at no time does anything that would actually precipitate their catch. On one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and child to tempt him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can look so deeply into Jericho's mind by recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make an assassin talk without tongues, but he can't get the assassin to make a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan on a blank range, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing, so Jericho won't worry unfortunately about Satan's health - not hygienically joining open bullet wounds? In fact, instead of just possessing Jericho himself to get close to Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much unnecessary energy on side projects (crucifixion of the ruthless guy, blowing Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then rescuing him, then blowing up again, ridiculously Jericho struggles when he could sniff him out with thinking) that we wonder if a more effective assassin / lover should not be put on the matter ?? says Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I Find Most Precious About * The End of Days * is Arnold's bold attempt at the method: "Sad" means scratching his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; "depressed" means raising a bottle to its lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; "scared" means expanding his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent. There is definitely a pattern here if we can only decipher it. In the end, the devil is not sent by the holy men who Catholics pray for liberation from apocalypse like these, but from the atheist Jericho. While the fate of the evil God encourages "belief" and stifles in their cells that do nothing about Satan actually walking among them, the human prince is opposed by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. As clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the devil were to exist, those who had been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would not be able to force a belief in his downfall, let alone act against it. Moreover, they cannot really WANT him defeated, because only through his opposite polarity their existence becomes durable. For it is written in the book of Revelation: "And the dark princess comes down to Earth without a solid game plan and impregnates a virgin on a date that does not matter before the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century adopts the day numbering that will put it in sync with equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax, which will annoy sensible people for millennia, after which Christians will have forgotten the actual date of birth of Christ and granted the pagan Saturnalia festival instead of him, and the prince must complete a revolution through dense purple pants and ambiguous lesbian band members ?? "I can believe that people are drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic is built as a Mr. Universe; I can think that a giant supernatural monster cannot kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil will perform some hokey thirteenth century Celtic Druid ritual as a foreplay - but what I can't believe is the 20-year-old virgin in New York City in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially around Prince ...
