There were good characters in here, played by cozy actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers ..... yet the movie just didn't work. When it was almost over, I was sad. The dialogue was silly, humor (mainly Milton Berle) was downright stupid and the music just wasn't up in my alley. I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear "In The Mood" again, I'll puke. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous skater actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so dated that it is no longer fun. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello etc. Etc. Be fun to the crowds in the 40s and 50s, but humor is changing and it was fun because it's not today.
