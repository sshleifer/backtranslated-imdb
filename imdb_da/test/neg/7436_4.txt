The indulgent problem with this movie is that it may not be able to use Bill Murray for the best of his ability simply because of the co-star. <br /> <br /> If this was a road movie with another comedian actor, it might work. Although they both tried to get the elephant across the country, it would at least allow them to share an entertaining dialogue. As it stands, Murray is back to talking to an elephant who can't answer back with witty dandruff. In essence, it means that Murray speaks to himself, and that makes the movie more boring than it might have been if he had another sign to jump. <br /> <br /> Children would enjoy this movie simply because of the elephant, but anyone who wants to see Bill Murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script should look elsewhere.
