Imagine if you want an alternative universe where someone has made seven, instead of a talented cast and crew, they have cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leaders. If your imagination cannot stretch so far, just look at MIMMER MAN, as this is the next worse thing <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! Jack Cole is a police officer with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal as he is also a person with a hidden past, but does not tell anyone because it is top secret. Perhaps the greatest secret is how a person like Seagal became a movie star in the first place, since GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all of Seagal's other films because it's complete, complete hug. Look at the way he introduces when his partner enters his office. "Yoi love beads man. In your wrong office," Steven replies with something that is split witty or he would if someone could understand a bloody word he said because too much of the movie he just mumbles away. In fact, the only time I could get out of his dialogue was the stage at school, breaking into the gun holding the class hostage. <br /> <br /> "Don't let me kill you" <br /> Is that how a policeman would say to a suicide gun? I'm just thinking that in another movie where Steven is not the hero (ie, a good movie), the police would say something like "Don't kill me, I have a wife and a few children waiting at home". Yet, the suicide warrior is going to blow his head off, but Steven saves his life by killing them through two sets of windows. It goes without saying that you should not try it at home. As the story progresses to Steven (I've given up calling him Jack, even though I'm told on the screenwriter to give Steven a sensible name) gets involved in a plagiarism case where someone has stolen bits from other superior serial killer movies . When Steven finds more victims, you can see him thinking, "What was the movie star Morgan Freeman as a policeman?" As he inspects the bodies, oh, and the action continues to switch back to the hero's home life just so we know this guy is good As a family man, this guy is very good as a family member so sorry he is as bad as a movie star
