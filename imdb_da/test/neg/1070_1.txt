It is fascinating how this title manages to slip away from the average viewer as something new and pioneering (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri herself must have thought herself: "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a great movie! I will try hard to do exactly the same movie and look for any marks!" Unfortunately, he even failed with his outrageous idea. The movie turns out to be a complete mistake. Considering that it's trying hard to capture the glory of Gus Van Sants' "Elephant", it makes it look even more ridiculous - a most embarrassing faux pas for a movie director. The movie starts with the suicide of a student in the school's bathroom. This scene already shows the awkward action skills of each involved in this scene. You don't buy a single word they say. You continue interrupted by short interview-styled children who "live on their married lives" with every bit quite distracting in their ordinary stupidity on the basis of every worthless monologue. Thalluri means introducing the characters this way to give some kind of quick-as-junk food insight see their hearts ... and fail again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally screams the audience "Yes people! I stole this movie and for some curious reasons I'm proud of it!" by taking Gus Van Sants most unmistakable storyline from "Elephant": He shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene in his particular way and role in a school situation. Hm, does this not seem so spoiled? For me, this particular degree of very forgiving tolerance had been violated right there to a point where I could no longer stop this horrible movie. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official elections in Cannes from 2006, whereas everyone must have definitely remembered "Elephant" (2003) at the same film festival a few years ago! So how in the name of the Lord did this most scandalous rip off there? I find myself completely confused by this mistake. Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of the audience, who (and cannot quite) be aware of any independent film out there. As Elephant has a bit to do with the mainstream cinema (although undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story told in "2:37" had been told before! How it is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to Cannes, I cannot say. It is boring and shameful that such things go on, and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is in every way exclusively commercial, worthless as an independent film and (at a certain level) rather a false parody of its obvious idol, "Elephant".
