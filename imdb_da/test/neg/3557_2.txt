I saw this movie based on the good reviews here and I will not make that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don't see what it is Flashback 12 hour and we'll see the boring life for each of these people, who are ultimately meaningless to what should happen. When the end is finally revealed, you realize that you just wasted an hour in your life waiting for a big payout that doesn't happen and doesn't matter to what you've seen. The only connection these people have is that they all had a "bad day" - but even though continuity is lost in the boredom. <br /> <br /> If this were to be a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
