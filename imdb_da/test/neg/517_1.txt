There is part of an order where some water rushes into the sunken plane, everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for Airport 77. You can even make Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots. A total rip off? Well almost per. Definition. There may be more storage recordings in this movie than in Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> All the new stuff, actors sitting in an airplane talking, is bland and terrible at all levels. Dennis Weaver is completely wasted in a career film, although it is true for anyone other than this movie director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many necessary false names to continue working. <br /> <br /> There is a level of poor professionalism that makes this movie so waste of time, it would actually be better if shot by someone without technical knowledge at all because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to Gathering a scene in the worst old school television fashion that this movie, like most of his films, is completely devoid of life. The worst kind of hack work. The worst kind of movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is a waste of money, an affair where the crew at all levels are ghosts hoping to get the extremely low paycheck they can and no one wants to see or know they showed up / participated in this rip off. There are so many people who want to make movies, it is disgusting to watch Ray burn up the money given to do more, but fill the time. His commentary is interesting because he has to start it by explaining that he is really Fred Ray, since he is not credited on the film itself. It tricked me into seeing it, don't let it fool you.
