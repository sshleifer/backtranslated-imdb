The 70s were undoubtedly the golden age of "made-for-TV" horror. This is one of those likely to be knocked out as an ABC movie this week. It is the old story of a house and / or ghost that holds one of the new owners. The film has promise, but it has never been realized. Everything is rushed too much. Tension and excitement need time to build and grow. And there's nothing new. We've seen it all before and a better one. A final thought: I do not understand why Robert Wagner's character would fall to the long-dead movie star when he is married to Kate Jackson for the sake of goodness! !!
