Hypothetical situations are in abundance, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse of the world's dead, back on the streets, in the shops, and across the countryside, in the midst of a forgotten desert. A lonely survivor trying to revive his hygiene takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone, he hopes for more, but with no one around, he is back with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe ?? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks barriers to human coexistence. Alan, a man of the book, is left on the ground after an unknown disaster. Thinking he is alone, does he begin to live life his way ?? until Jeri Ryan (as she wanted in every dream) out of the woods, confused and unhappy to find the final man alive ... well ... like Alan. In any case, they try to co-exist, fail, become full, and before they create the ultimate dystopia, they run into Redneck Raphael (the play of the new arrival Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically ghastly geek vs. brainless jock. Even with no one back on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will emerge. <br /> <br /> Using a variable movie technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based on another movie titled "The Silent Earth" (which I will see next) strange as he never gives anyone credit to. With a borrowed story, I think he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His stroke seems to be lacking at first, while Ralston is trying to find his step, borrowing from other movie director's techniques to try to find his own. He opens the film interesting enough, but does not answer any direct answers. Certainly, the last few days have arrived, but there could be a brief answer to "how" or better yet "why" these selected few survived. A cruel beginning would have led us to a comic movie. The compilation would have been like "Shawn of the Dead", but instead we left feeling that we saw a program for "TV for television". Listen to the audio commentary, I respect Ralston, because he worked diligently to get this movie made, and his passion almost made the movie, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he was not so happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes they pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. Although it makes it a decent independent film production, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston's case it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that David Arnot's depiction of Alan hooked me. He played the wimpy, school geek, adult role very well. He was fun to watch and listen to, and thus he became likeable to the viewer. He was an important player in keeping the movie together, unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first movie and it was obvious ?? I think ?? really really obvious. There were scenes where I thought the cue card was coming out and reading the lines for him, maybe even giving us a more realistic performance, but unfortunately it wasn't. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled into her character at the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. She goes from alien unknown to bitter, sharp, crazy girlfriend at the end. Confused? Again, she fell into her character at the end and gave us just a glimpse of what she probably could have done when she matured. Even as the comment progressed, all she contributed was a laugh, giggle or "oh, look at that color" moment. While her beauty can sell tickets, one can consider that knowledge is just as beautiful. This was her first movie, so can I be too hard? <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie felt it was missing something. Although the idea was strong ?? the premise that even with only a peppering of people who remain on earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is used by zinc?) And we as a race will always have what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising instructor, his techniques are flawed and prejudiced, but he knows how to make a low budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"fun" is different, so I couldn't laugh at many of the bits he found "hysterical". His actors gave the level of action needed for this movie, which was lower than average. His film was loose, meaning there were elements that had never been explained or tackled (ie something with wings survived?!?), Which generally damaged the film's intensity. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much more fun. For those who think that Roger Avery was a big feature of this movie that we learn from their comment, was all he was for, money? it was essentially the bank of "The Last Man". Don't get hoped for any classic Avery moments. Don't expect more from Ralston ?? And that's how I want to finish it. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** out of *****
