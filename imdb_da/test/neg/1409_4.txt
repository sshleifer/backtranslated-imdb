I was aware of this year's critical pans and unremarkable gross, but was willing to give the film the benefits of doubt because I know good pictures can fall under the radar during the months of crowded release plan. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. Surprisingly, an understatement is contemplating Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and Robin Williams' obvious comics. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underutilized. On the "Making Of" featurette that comes with the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he sometimes made Robin Williams improvise out of the manuscript, as if it was something scary secret of his. Um? Are you really so much of a fun, Barry Levinson? When you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use him for his comedic abilities (in principle, every movie he's been in other than insomnia or One Hour Photo) doesn't bother him in a script. Let him ad lib what he wants because he is more fun than anything else can write to him, and his unmatched comics can instantly raise the line on any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more confusing about his lack of use of Robin Williams was that in 1987, Levinson used this exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam, where Robin Williams's outbreak of comic zaniness is injected into a war image to create a resounding political piece. <br /> <br /> So the movie is not so much of a laughter party as it could be and feels scary in its tone. If the movie had the potential to act as something, it could have made one of these thrillers from the mid-90s in the style of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive or one of those Jack Ryan movies. Its plot centered on an employee of a Silicon Valley company who revealed a bug in a system that reveals that the country chose the wrong president and efforts of the CEOs to remove her before the secret comes out, so if you replace Robin Williams with some Harrison-Ford-type actor, or even Harrison Ford himself, added a couple of explosions, and perhaps this is where the movie was trying to go. I never really know and it is not worth trying to find out.
