This is the first porn I have ever tried to review. It requires a different approach than normal, as the allegory will not reward dissection. "I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin." "We are European. We are cultured and sexual." "It's nice when we all screw each other." Lots to talk about! Well, that's actually a kind of compared to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the class's "enervating patina" delivers at least pure detailed compositions. But what the hell is there to say about a porn? OK then: The only scene I really (rhetorical) came to was the first time Brigitte Maier entered. There are efforts to throw in a great range of races and ages, while no two men are at all close to each other; one black guy suffers from an premature editorial coitus interruptus. And more take or not, a perhaps indescribable-on-IMDb action looks as if it was partially simulated by a surgical tube. I was still awake and it was eight in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean?
