So let's say you are a producer, you have some money and somehow you have Richard gear and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but why disturb? See, this movie is really awful, the play is pretty good, but casting is terrible gear and Willis did their best to play those characters they simply can't play. now this movie has no plot or there is something trying to pass as a plot: There is an average hitman (Willis) who is tough and sophisticated (in fact, he is not one of those things but from a dialogue between the other characters you need to get this impression) so this hitman is on a mission to kill someone, now there is an ex-IRA prisoner who is kind and handsome and very sympathetic (gear) that the FBI releases from prison so he will help them. So now the FBI "examines" to find this hit man, the investigation consists of a number of unlikely information - like a random person lost his wallet, and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right for the money. as there is no real plot and the manuscript is so wild, one can not expect any real character development or excitement, so instead of creating them through history, they just add some interrupted dramatic music that signals you that something very dramatic takes place, instead of actually creating something dramatic. The bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time which somehow has an incredibly high score for its level, probably because of cast - and that's exactly what the producers expect.
