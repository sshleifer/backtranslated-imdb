If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to monitor the release of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors and to avoid running off the 1996 Child Pornography Protection Act, a woman dumps us and everyone welcomes. Have I missed a meeting? Besides the blatant pedophilia, this film is quite distinguished. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? If army is this? The uniforms must have come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw some patches, who cares? Just make sure each one of them has a Big Red One. There is a small inside joke here that undoubtedly went over the author's head, but could possibly have been hit by the one who provided military vehicles. There were certainly no military advisers. The US Army does not operate slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. The US Army does not put 14-year-old girls into work at military bases or allow them to use firing lines or training courses. There is much drama to be extracted in teenage girls who are sexually surviving. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it at all.
