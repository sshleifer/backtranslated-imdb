OK, it can be seen if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. However, the disbelief suspension required to pass through this film is significant. Firstly, do you think in today's modern society that college coeds get what is committed to someone in such a short time, even though you are a "skilled" habitat volunteer who likes autistic children? And the 2-week romance flourishes into an exchange of letters leading to John's conflict as to whether to resume right after 9/11/01 ... really? He asks her what to do? Every guy we know shouldn't sit on the sidelines after these towers came down (my husband was one of them and I love him and am proud of him to go) John's character is so flat. He is almost expressing the whole movie. He looks good, but not Spec Ops ... he seems to be unsure of not self-confidence, quiet rather than a hell-raiser, no tattoos, come in a "fight" with preppy boys who are no more than a push fight really ... walks around without a cover upside down almost the entire movie ... and there are military technical errors everywhere (epaulets upside down?). The war scenes are stupid ... John and another guy run by themselves ... hey, then other guy gets shot and John pulls him 10 feet and starts giving buddy help before securing the area or back-up arrival or even have your back to the deck ... it's a ceasefire for God's sake, you don't stop fighting until it's over ... hi I would shoot John in the back. Back home when the truth is revealed and she wastes the wine ... we hated her to remove her shirt in his presence ... WTH? break his heart and then right him in horror She's a headbag of troll. The best part of the movie is when he drives away from her ... at least he had some self-respect and honor there. Overall incredible story and we generally did not care about those signs or their love. Gloomy!
