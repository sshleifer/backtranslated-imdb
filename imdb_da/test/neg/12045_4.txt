I saw this movie when it first came out and hated it. I've just seen it again 27 years later. I actually liked some of it ... even though Robin Williams was completely wrong for the role ... What I remember most about hate the movie is that it was almost completely opposite to what I had understood when I read the book. Since I haven't read it again, I can only give you my impressions of the past - but I'm sure one thing - the movie is a break for family life, while in the book almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially marriage - appear to be strait jackets that we would be free of. The only positive in the book is the wonderful nature of children ... something that only begins and ends the movie really captures (with the incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air. Wrong Williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) My low mark is therefore from the movie fails the book. As a movie alone, it goes better - but only for a few important performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think somebody sees it would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow, as a former soccer player who has had a sex-change operation, is amazing ... he has never even camped or made the character anything but legitimate - and as such his performance had incredible integrity. I watched him closely during all his scenes, and never was he anything but female. Nothing in his performance ever came near a dragon queen ... and it made all the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, he is the only one who is indescribable. It is worth watching this movie only for his performance.
