This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It has been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then, and I doubt there will ever be a movie that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun with a variety of movies, for example 'Nell' (!) And instead of fun it is just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or know this waste and if someone throws it at you .... turn around and drive the other way !!
