When King Kong removed her from her summit in the 1976 remake, I was breathless. I don't know how many times I went back to see that movies are hoping to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (she became one), but she was so hot! I went to see "Sweet Dreams" when it came out because at that time Mrs Lange had become a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And she is always exciting to see. <br /> <br /> I never went out of a movie faster. My wife agreed. <br /> <br /> When we got into the car, I turned to her and said, "If you had told me I would be bored to see Jessica Lange take off my clothes, I would have told you crazy. I was just sorry to see Jessice Lange take off her clothes! "How bad is that?
