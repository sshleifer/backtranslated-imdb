This movie SUCKS !! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together randomly. Good doing, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I figured she had PMS. It certainly seemed like that. The title of this movie is horrible. A scene the woman spoke and a few seconds before we hear sound. I knew at the moment that my suspicions were correct that it was not from the United States. I tried to follow, but lost halfway through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good signs, but not many. Not worth wasting your time.
