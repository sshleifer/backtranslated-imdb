I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was quite happy with the version that Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon played. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, I do not understand how they dared to tear each other out of this classic story and made the characters completely different, starting with changing Beth as the younger sister and making Amy the third. And Jo's interpretation, horrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and rather angry young lady, and the actress depicting Jo in this movie seems like a foolish and very annoying little girl. And what about Laurie at war? I'm OK with the fact that when making a book in a movie, some changes need to be made, but not the whole story. very very badly done.
