Greetings, Moviegoers! As I look at Octopus II, I am considering the inherent lameness of Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror Genre. Many filmmakers can blame the bad play, indecent script or poorly constructed plot as the reasons why the OCD movie should flood. These reasons may actually be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, OCD and CGI technology currently used by studies lack the ability to smoothly blend in with real world configurations and characters. Even with smart movies, you can only film the half-dark depths of the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado gets bored completely with the genre (OCD subgenre it is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, you ask? I would not suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue must be explored. We can't really go back to the days of "Fade-to-Black" cue that someone has been killed. Or can we? If we cannot reach the goal of realism, we must compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, insinuation, and photo science. <br /> <br /> It will be through ingenious and alternative methods that the disease of lameness, which is so common for the OCD subgenre, will be cured.
