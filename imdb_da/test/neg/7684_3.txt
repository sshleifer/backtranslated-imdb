Now I want to come clean and admit that I was forced into my history to watch this movie and then write a short film evaluation as part of my class. Although I had seen movies alone, in my own discretion, I found it extremely boring and absurd. The style is dated beyond its years, and the play is farcical. Instead of using dialogue, they instead shift eye-catching eyes to each other, or sometimes in thin air. For me it is that the top actor does not transmit any great feeling, and after I have seen an extreme close-up Ivan's face for a hundred times, I asked for the film to end. <br /> <br /> However, the most disappointing is how wrong Ivan is. This man was ugly, his bodyguard murderous thugs and his character fake. For me, the film was nothing but a piece of Stalin propaganda, inaccurate and boring.
