I thought this series would be another fun, action series with some dynamic plot and great performances. I was mistaken. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth looking at unless you enjoy seeing some people brutalized and the agents' actions allegedly justified under the theme of "national security". The show is good propaganda for the current government and spits out the Jingoism as if we are talking like that every day. After a few episodes, it was boring in hell out of me, and I began to see reruns of House Invaders at BBCAmerica instead. Look better at CSI and without track, no doubt.
