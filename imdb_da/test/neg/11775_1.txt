Nothing to see here. It has all been done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - lacking in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In a moment when she could have taken the high road - she jumped into new addiction with both feet and held her breath - no better than a reason to "me too!" If she was not the beautiful and young person she portrays on the screen - but more like the real human wreck represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions, we change the channels in a nanosecond. <Br /> <br /> This movie starts at the bottom and goes downhill. No redeeming, no teaching is taught - nothing uplifting in any way. None of the main characters even give sympathy, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have had more fun if I wanted to close a door on my hand. Who needs drifting like this?
