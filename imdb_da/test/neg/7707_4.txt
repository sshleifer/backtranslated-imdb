A college professor is working to create zombies, and you wouldn't know it is going wrong. Next thing you know, the entire campus is over. The goodness there are a few uber commands trained for just such a situation. Too bad, they must be accompanied by a group of moron commands, led by a rapper (he doesn't even like to play a military guy, he just answers his superiors as if he were rappin 'wit' da homies in then hood). The highlight of this part of the movie is the closet room scene. The male and female moron commands share the same locker room and apparently military provisions require all women to wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. My hat is off the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So after many discussions on how well prepared these moron commands are for the job (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all killed in relatively short order. Their biggest downfall seems to be that it never happens to them to turn on lights. A typical meeting has them going into a room and seeing someone in the far end. Human or zombie? Can't tell. Flip on the lights? No, the moron commando protocol requires that they go up to the person, so be sure to keep their gun in such a way that it can easily be knocked out of their hand and well you know the drill. The assault of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is particularly fun - my favorite scene involves a rapper in any movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again, hats for the filmmakers), the hottest child among the moron commands manages to survive. Her and the female uber command both won in tight T-shirts for the rest of the movie. Now that's how a military operation must be performed! There are a lot of races around and punctured my humorous things that the uber commands can't get through a simple vent grille (it's obviously a thin piece of aluminum that you can easily put your fist through). This necessitates a plan to rub the zombie boy over himself, and although we haven't seen anything in the movie to indicate that zombies find their prey by smell, they are good enough to immediately start sniffing zombies and letting our heroes go. <br /> <br /> A few other fun pieces - Paris Hilton Gag, "Can you hear me now?" gag and the fact that even though the zombies are biting secondary characters immediately, the main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on. Another chuckle is provided by Mr Fingaz, who cannot seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?). All in all, it's a bit entertaining. Could have used some more interesting characters, but for a Sci-Fi Channel original I was mildly impressed.
