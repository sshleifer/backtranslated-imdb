This movie was horrible that it was sorta like accidentally seeing a gay porn waiting for the girls, but they just didn't come .... I waited nearly 2 hours for the horrible scarecrowers .... they just came does not .. . Instead, it's just something stupid ass wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera. It's a blend of Blaire witch and a bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that on October 23, 2005, they started filming a sequel, don't be fooled by the box, even though it looks like the first dark harvest, it's not the lion's gate bought the rights to the corn: the movie and had it brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark harvest, which I thought was fun ........ all they had in common were they both shot in a corn field .... This Film WILLLLLL doesn't scare the crop out of you as the first, then stay away !!!!!
