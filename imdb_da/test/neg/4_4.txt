Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Trustworthy performances, but the script had nowhere to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an independent event string, some of which continue the story. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? What about Fischer and Thomas? Ultimately, no true front story ever develops, and the characters themselves are artificially set up by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, over and over again. Finally long after you do not care more, you will learn something about the script meetings. Three conclusions were undoubtedly offered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one after another after the other. If you can hang out past the 100th gap, you will be able to retrieve them. Despite the transparent attempt to get points with a dedication to the coast guard, this should have washed out the very first day.
