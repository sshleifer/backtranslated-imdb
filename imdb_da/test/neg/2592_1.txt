"The new hope for Romanian cinema" ... if this is the new hope, then I do not really like to see the exciting completely of such a beautiful cinema (Romanian cinema, that is). Now seriously, where do I start? 1. The crappy scenario: Do ​​you scour me, it's not even credible not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2. The direction: What direction? This movie should have had psychological excitement, at least because they have decided to make it look as scary as possible. Okay, I admit, Radu Muntean is no Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could continue), but at least the least work would have been appreciated. 3. Language: Okay, I don't understand why (almost) every Romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and indecent as possible, then you have art. I don't mind explicit language or poor picture quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile. In this case, it does not. There is nothing to comment on, since all that this film will say was already told a thousand times, the characters are too thinly depicted to be memorable, the "shocking events" that arise are also poorly illustrated and become negligible. This movie only depends on the self-induced emotions, on "we must" hype. Someone was found murdered, so "WE MUST" feel sad, frightened or panic, someone went through this, and then "MUST MUST" feel in a certain way. It's baloney. Because a movie is a piece of fiction, nothing is right here. So the only true feelings are those you discover as you walk deep into the world of the world (the film's, that is) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
