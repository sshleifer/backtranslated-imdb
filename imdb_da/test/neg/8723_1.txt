Nonsense. Totally undesirable. The authors must not have read the book or seen David Lynch's film. Not worth wasting your time. <br /> <br /> Longer doesn't get better. While more in-depth than Lynch's films, it has the rough accuracy and the key parts of history. <br /> <br /> "One night at Roxbury" is more worth your time.
