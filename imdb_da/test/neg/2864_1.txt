Ca. A step over an Olsen's twins movie, there is a surprise in the store here, except for how abominable the inflated, dived Depardieu looks at walking around the beach without a shirt on. This guy should be a kind of heartthrob? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, what even. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress whose career over the last couple of years has shown much of her potential as both a comic and dramatic actress, but this film absolutely did nothing for her to offer. a break-out role. Her stupid character lacks traces of personality or self-esteem and uses her entire vacation to crush a sweet boy who she thinks is the greatest guy in the other world (largely because he is a sweet boy), but she can't be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something; If a guy really gets into you, he won't bump into a huff because you tried to pass your father on as your boyfriend. He may be a little confused as to why you would do something so stupid, confused and um ... incestuous, but in the end it will just be something you will laugh about. <br /> <br /> The reason and dialogue hit every cliche right on the cue. No originality and no ... but it's shaken, Rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, rilly cute, so viewers who think Titanic is the biggest movie ever made, will of course say that this movie is great because they won't notice that it does not have a brain in the head. A star.
