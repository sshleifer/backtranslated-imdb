Larry Clark is not known for his talents as an author or instructor, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, disgust and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial character to reveal very serious problems in modern youth. Children exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched on similar issues. Ken Park dealt with some ham handy sex with sexual abuse and suburbs. Undoubtedly, all these films have exposed something terrible and left a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Latin American skateboarders from southern Las Angeles who intentionally go to Beverly Hills to skate. That is it. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially non-existent narrative. And like Kids, it's a cast of first-time actors who were pulled out of the movie setting. But unlike children, none of them has any kind of talent. It is better to shop in porn. This movie undoubtedly contains the most horrible performances I've ever seen in a feature film. You can respect Larry Clark for exposing these young men to the filmmaking process, but these kids are definitely cringe-worthy people. May I add that these gentlemen apparently also produced the soundtrack, which contains some of the most dismally inept garage punk you will ever hear - my advice is to pop a few migraine pills before entering the theater or you will regret it afterwards. <br /> <br /> But then again it is not as if they had much of a script to work with. Each line that is pronounced is one constructed, pathetically delivered and annoying beyond any goal. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts reasonably enough, but soon slips unexpectedly into pure absurdity. This, of course, begins with a whimsical gown with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich√© National Lampoonish meetings, characters being killed for no reason, and ultimately resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots go much further than they need. Be prepared to watch people fall off skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, oblong, protracted shots of characters that do nothing or skateboarding down the streets. But then again, with the script on just under 32 pages, they need as much useless filler as possible. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway I could go on like that. This is the worst movie Larry Clark has made yet. For those of you who are interested in watching a Clark movie, if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the tamest movie he's made yet, and that's the worst. It's flat out terribly. Like, Uwe Boll terrible. Definitely the worst I saw at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
