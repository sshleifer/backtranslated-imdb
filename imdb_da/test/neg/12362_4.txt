Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the Giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]' films from the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of it, instead of what was. So how will a monster movie be completed in 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical that makes the spiders grow into large proportions, they blend films like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and taste it with a parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but eight Legged Freaks were so full of parodies and stupid jokes that sometimes it was more like Scary Movie. It was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody full of jokes. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this, you don't expect much from the actor, and that's just the way it was. The story, however, was extremely thin, with just a lot of loosely connected events to showcase some actions mixed with all the jokes, leading to a slightly spotty and corny ending. I rate eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects were pretty good and that they sound the spiders did how fun.
