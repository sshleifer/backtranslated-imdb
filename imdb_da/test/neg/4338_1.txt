Do not pay attention to the rave reviews of this movie here. It's the worst Van Damme movie and one of the worst kinds I've ever seen. It would appeal to someone without depth, what only requires more than firearms and explosions. To see that this is addressed by Peter Hyams, it has made me realize that Peter has no talent as a director, but is very good at filming and the like. But movies also have other elements; For example, a story. This one did not have one. This may explain the horror of some of Mr Hyam's newer films, almost no better than this one. Really one cannot wonder how some people were ever put behind a camera.
