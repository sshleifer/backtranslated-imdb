This is what Disney Channel shows to children who are stupid than posts. It suits them well. It's not fun, the play is the worst I've seen for many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and all about this show makes you moan and roll your eyes. Want to know why? Not only is this show a waste of smell, the leader "actress" Selena Gomez resembles a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and be wasted. Also, the author of the show is inconsistent. In an episode, the security guard is called "sir" by a character and is called as a woman of everything else. <br /> <br /> Hey? This is called proofreading and editing. Do it once, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promotion of the new "Four Part Blood Sucking Story"? Disney wanted their own version of Twilight vs Harry Potter stuff. Except a million times lame. Wizards of Waverly Place Movie ?? Think about it for a moment. Family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents. SAME PLOT from The Proud Family Movie etc ... What's worse is that all Emmies and ALMA's have it. And most of the audience is any age 4-13 (and no life-threatening). how many years? before selena gomez shows his breasts? <br /> <br /> and Disney shows are all crap..hack writers .. chin shows .. destroy the minds and wallets of today's youth ..
