I really don't know why I agreed to watch this movie, but as a complete fool I did, and I deserve to be shot! I had seen the original Killjoy, well I say I've seen it .... I started to see it, but found it so bad that I ended up seeing it at 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of with the annoying dialogue, but I said I would see it and I did even though it was at 4x speed. To cut a long story short Killjoy 2 kicks off where Killjoy got rid of. By this I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as act and cheapness. I have nothing against low budget film, in fact I like them, they are somewhat different from Mega budget blockbusters, but this movie is just awful! The action is devilish and the manuscript ... Well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and a paper, and he wanted to produce something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh that the clown has so obviously called! Anyway, I didn't make it through this movie, about three-quarters of the way through it was the time to turn it off and throw it through the window. It might have been a rip off to buy as a DVD, but as a frisbee it was a mega purchase! <br /> <br /> For love for humanity itself. DO NOT see this muck, it may be the worst I have ever seen and consider some of the muck I've seen that says a lot! <br /> <br /> My rating on this movie would be .... Nailgun to head / 10
