I rented this TV movie version of 'Troilus and Cressida' out of my library last Thursday, and just couldn't believe my eyes. Where do I start? No effort was made to make the game look distant as if the Trojan war, all actors were wearing Elizabethan dress. In addition, most of the actors for old and horrible mistreatment - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was badly played anyway, and Thersites was a transvestite. <Similarly, the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish, the camera angle focuses more on Nestor's face, so we can only see what's going on in the background, which is frustrating in itself. Yet the "battle" at the end is given it respect. We don't see Troilus and Diomedes fight, nor anybody else for that matter, Paris and Menelaus just seem to be joking in front of Thersites. Even the death of Patroclus was omitted. All of this was a big disappointment considering that I waded through a very boring 2 and a half hour of BBC costume drama to get to that time. <br /> <br /> However, not everything was bad. I thought Incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even though they weren't right. I would say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles when he did not have the striking face and was sometimes a little dry. SPOILER: The Climax at the end - Hector's death - was perhaps the best part of the movie. Achilles' dialogue here is excellent and summarizes the attitude of a cold, spicy killer. But the horror scene of the scene (when Achilles stamps on what was Hector's head) still distinguishes it. <br /> <br /> Charles Gray as Pandarus was lovely as a sleazy old pervert and I thought the actor who played Cressida did an OK job. The war-defying Troilus, however, was annoying, and I think the game would have been better if he had been murdered by Achilles instead of a peacenic like Hector. Conclusion? OK, but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least tried to see ancient Greek, not to mention the lack of action. 5.10
