This comes close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The author starts you in a way that you want to sit with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he absolutely didn't do anything wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) left him for Kelley (Chris Klein), in a way that leaves you upset with Sam. You don't mind what she feels, so her feelings with Kelley are not right for you and their relationship is false. It pulls you in both directions and it becomes rather exhausting and annoying. The only good thing about this movie that I saw was the cast. <br /> <br />
