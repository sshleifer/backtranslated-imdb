Fortunately, I saw this movie alone so I could speed through the worst scenes (aka most of the movie, actually). Okay, some of it is not too bad, with some good photography (even some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes not so bad directions. But it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and much worse acting. In addition, when I don't find the movie's "hottie" to be all that, the wannabe-sexy love scenes become boring. Really boring! And to the drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you don't like all the characters, as much as you really don't care who lives and dies. <br /> <br /> If you still haven't got tired of the reality series Survivor, you can find something in your taste in this movie. If not, get ready!
