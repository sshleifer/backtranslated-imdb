Went a chance to see if maybe a really good WWI movie had delighted my message - it's not. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both stiff in their action and miscast for their roles. The dialogue is stupid or non-existent; the flying sequences are okay, but rather repetitive. Compared to the amazing "Blue Max", this film should never have been made. See George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress in BM and you get why that movie is one of the best war movies ever made, and it's not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown presented as a great "lost classic" from the 70s, I resell the mine the day after I bought it. Don't waste your time or $.
