Well, it wasn't a complete waste. Armand was, as usual, very good in the movie ,,, the whole Turks vs. German stuff was a bit strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie ... not disturbing going back and checking ... the central theme is about serial schemes with the entire bend warfare loosely woven. Never seen a movie where the characters were so Italian should be Turk, taking English (American accent and euphemism) with German words. The climate was the most exciting part, and there are parts of it that still didn't make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing else to do, see this movie ..
