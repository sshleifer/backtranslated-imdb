When THE PUFFY CHAIR waves, watch out for its soft, colorful padding. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-couple who have a bit of hard time with their relationship. An argument arises one night and Josh asks Emily to join a road trip to his father's house, where Josh plans to deliver a purple LazyBoy recliner for his father's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's brother-in-law Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish looking more in touch with other people's lives than his own. <br /> <br /> The drive is quickly transformed into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very fuzzy and falling apart until Josh "convinces" the original owner to renovate it ). Rhett quickly states that the cause of all Emily and Josh's problems is LazyBoy and puts it to the flashlight one night ... And that's the last thing we hear about the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the movie is The Puffy Chair when it's not the chair of anyone taking the center. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for each other. When the chair is destroyed, there is never another mention of it, even if they arrive at Josh's parents on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor his father. There is no connection between it and these people's lives. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why isn't there a connection with it at the end? The bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director, but also the cameraman (and not very good). Almost all scenes have a fast zooming of the characters that become grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus captures and the rights themselves. It was initially a picturesque and artistic feeling, but quickly became unbearable. The action in the movie is accessible and entertaining. All actors / actresses did good jobs. But the poor quality of production, the silent end and the lack of coherence in the title meant that this girl too many problems.
