When this show first came to Disney, I love to see it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows ever, but this show somehow turned into something that is disturbing and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Now, I find some of the second and third season fun, they seem like a treat to some teens show. I have that waste. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie, who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I don't like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses out of me. The reason for the second season also sucks and is just awful
