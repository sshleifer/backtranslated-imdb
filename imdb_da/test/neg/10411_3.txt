A family (a teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad) who are ill in city life decide to move to the mountains to get away from it all and get a fresh start. However, their idyll is crushed by three brothers and their dominant father, who do not kindly accept newcomers on their patches. While having objects thrown through the window and threatened on the street, it's just the beginning, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the horrible threesome. Since the law is not willing to do anything about it and the violence escalates quickly, the boy decides to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> Between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the worst exploitation films ever made. In the beginning you can get a chuckle on some of the hammy-acting and ridiculous dialogues given to the characters, especially the overwhelmed evil. But then you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to see, or thug sister is being sucked up by her siblings because they are daring to sleep with our young ones altogether. In fact, the entire display of women in the film, which seems to be pathetic creatures that scream a lot and cannot defend themselves, is quite despicable. But of course there is the mandatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving in a pool bra-less under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to throw her train. Right?! The Climax centers at the teenager who have so far been unable to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a Rambo clone and blowing their attackers to the left, right and center to save his stiffs being held hostage by the gang. It's amazing but hey, so everything else in this movie is .. so at least you can't blame it for not being consistent. So instead of trying to find logic in a place where the word does not exist, check out the IMDb pages of Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie. Contract. Note a pattern that appears here? Their career hit everyone once. Why? Pass through this and everything will be clear. Remember children if you want to move on to this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
