This flick is TERRIBLE! It stands out in disgust and makes you laugh, but it fails terribly. Of course, the director has no sense of slap stick doing comedy, and the actors are like nothing I've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy. Even their attempts at the English languish are really sad, and in fact, the exact peculiar Swedish accent, where the disjointed dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comical and pleasant thing about this film. Even I do terrible and convincing. If you want to make a comedy, I suggest you turn to classic fares like the evil dead series or even brain death if you have to. We all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but that's ridiculous!
