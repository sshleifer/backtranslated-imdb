This movie is simply appalling how the talent involved is without human conviction. Although they must have game when they thought about this idea, I feel as if 2 hours in my life have been taken from me. Hvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this nonsense, it should have been a great crime movie, but it evolves into a wild water spray of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep through movies, you won't miss anything. Humor is set to appeal To the lowest common dominance, movies can lift us and remind us that life is worth living. This movie just regrets you. As DeNiro said in a movie, the sweetest thing in life is wasted talent. This film is a perfect example of this statement.
