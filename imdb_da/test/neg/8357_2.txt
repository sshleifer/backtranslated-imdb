I'm writing this review simply because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was shocked by the movie. I think if you hadn't read the book, you would have lost sight of the movie as it did not give any real backward story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences in the summer camp, her first therapists (actually, the film gets the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling) ...). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. <br /> <br /> I found the book to be a living depiction of depression that highlighted Wurtzel's low points and the experiences she had along the way. The film, however, began at Harvard and literally threw the audience straight in without any real explanation of what was going on. <br /> <br /> Events that were important in the book (like Wurtzel's abortion, her summer working in Dallas, suicide attempt on Prozac) were omitted from the movie. This is also pedantic, but Wurtzel does not lose his virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt shown at Sterling's office was quite different from the book. Initially, she actually transferred Mellaril, in contrast to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you have read the book and enjoyed it / identified it, I don't see the movie. Read 'More, Now, Again' (by the same author) instead. Or see the girl interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature was the performance of Anne Heche, whom I believe exhibited Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, although her performance seemed a bit ... quiet. Jessica Lange made a pleasant impression, but saw the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. Conclusion? Do not want to.
