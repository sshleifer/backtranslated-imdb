A carnivorous octopus where does that guy Boaz (what ...?) Davidson continues to get inspiration? Yet, even for the low, low standards of both the giant sea creature that kills the people and me, this is just beyond terrible. Squid is one of the lameest, stupidest, weakest monsters I've ever seen. I think he ended up in the (ahum) East River because Sea World got sick of him. The actors can be seen repeatedly and help the octopus choke them. Block idiots, that way he will never learn! You want all the other giant killer octopuses (it's the right majority by the way) to laugh at him? Meanies. <br /> <br /> To stop the squid is wind, razors that are hard to handle and also special sailor Nick Hartfield and his partner who will retire in a week, but must first be eaten by octopus. Mr, octopus won the fight! A few more and he will evolve (the scars in my mind remain) .Nik of course trying to help him do not do a marvelous thing (does he not have a gun or something?) But no, it also doesn't help any magic. <br /> <br /> Okay, enter the marin's love interest Rachel Starbird. Is it based on some comics or something? At least they try to stop the squid by walking in the park. They hope it helps, as it is July 4th in a few days, and octopus can join the party. And you don't know what he is when he's full. Rachel then gets a school bus from nowhere to make sure this movie doesn't end while Nick feeds the octopus with several sails. <br /> <br /> But everything is bad that ends wrong, Nick manages to blow squid for a couple of times, and a bunch of kids who happened to be there are raising and laughing. You know by gastric vision it would probably get a R. real life, I want to say all ages, but I'm like all ages, so my final idea is: Suitable for absolutely none. There is no sex, no one does, nothing. Now this movie forgets ever existed. Join the club.
