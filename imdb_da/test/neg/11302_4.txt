A typical old b & w movie. The dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they become naive, sometimes very naive, occasionally close to the point where they are inadvertently comical. The first third, with background information on Ladd's Gatsby shown with a number of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the movie. But when Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves at Betty Field, the movie becomes too melodramatic. The end is another ending ending; I don't know if the novel itself contains this stupid, clich√© end or whether the film's producer has made any changes to it, but I have always considered car accidents to be a bad way to add drama to the end of a story. I've seen this plot unit a million times (or if it's not a car then it's a fall from a horse); The author does not know how to end the story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a car accident. Lame. And to make matters worse, the accident is tremendously random and perilous, both plot and early; plot-wise because Fields husband's mistress (Winters) is killed by Field and the fact that Winters kind of rushes out of the gas station in the street as if she had never noticed in the years she had lived in the fact that there was a dangerous road just above her house - and of course, the moment she comes out, she sees Ladd's car and fails it to Fields man's car and then shouts "Over here! I'm here! Drive me over and make it end tragic that way ! "; occasionally because Ladd and Field get involved in an accident on the day when they are preparing to tell Fields husband about their affair. Basically, there is too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also does not help with this movie, how Winters husband, Da Silva, vengeance to kill the guy who ran over his wife; He does the basics by walking around like a zombie, going from car to car, looking for scratches and working very badly. Both Da Silva's plays and his character's behavior throughout the film are terrible and confusing. <br /> <br /> A few times, Scott Fitzgerald was disturbed by how his novels were adapted to the screen of Hollywood writers, and - although he was dead long before this film was made - he might have been entitled to to complain and judge by the film's naive script. Or maybe his novels are even sweeter and more naive than this movie, and were actually enhanced by the screen customizations. Or the movies are pretty much like novels. Of course I could read this novel to find out, but I just can't be bothered. Fitzgerald's name does not inspire me to read any of his books (and I do not mean how his name sounds.) He was certainly no Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway ?? much noise about nothing.
