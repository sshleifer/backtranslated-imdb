Talk about waste! I can't think of a good thing in this movie. The play was poor, the play was terrible and the effects, well there were no effects. I can't believe the author of this movie made identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start ending. <br /> <br /> The front of the video box shows a showman with sharks as teeth and scary eyes. I look like a scary villain, but as the old saying "never judge a book because of cover", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. A part of the movie becomes a girl killed by a salad tang, horrible. The setting was bad enough as they could to set the whole case in Lapland, but no, a tropical island instead. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted, but the one thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the sticky effects. You can argue that I haven't seen the first one, but see this I would be sure if I didn't try it. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were homemade, and the carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I would guess the budget of this movie would probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer in the last minute panic must grab the actors on the street giving them the manuscript that said they have 6 minutes to practice these lines and shoot on an island. Finally, the play in the movie was painful, it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the road. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this movie: 0 stars out of 5
