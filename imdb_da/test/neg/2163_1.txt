Cyber ​​Zone, when this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B-Grade junk I've seen. Apart from a singer's deadpan action by Singer indicating that he knew how bad the movie was, the other actors are hovering on true attempts at line delivery (Swanson and Quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movie scenes. Mathius Hues makes the most ham-fisted depiction of dying since Jim Carrey's Mask. All this without any real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof after genre, period or any common vein is generally annoying. Don't even try to stick with the dots. It is Blade Runner, thinly disguised without content, actors or nature because of a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never more obvious. There are repeated annoying reuse of limited sets, with no attention to dressing and a spear of special effects that would have hit Dr Who's mill in 1976. The helicopter explosion is worth rewinding to show my point. Of course, there are masochists who want to cut this tripe, but if you watch this movie for a bet, be sure to get more than your payday. At $ 2, this DVD will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster.
