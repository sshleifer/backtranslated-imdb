I wish I could tell you that this movie is as exciting as the theories it presupposes. But i can not. Another species could have come and mutated while waiting for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know about the wrong theories, you could almost confuse him with stamps. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have thrown Darwin like a dullard, making him a bad service. Even when he briefly forfeits his mind because of his tireless theory, it was not interesting to see. Maybe good thinkers are boring people? I don't know what I was expecting: A forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes that regrets his love for all things simian, the glitter of madness stretching from a furrowed forehead? A long-haired hermit who blew to animals? A head cradle that is light-eyed with its eyes illuminated as the beacon of truth? All of the above would have been great. These are the movies for Scorsese sake. <br /> <br /> But there was none. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtile as the Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine a person with Darwin's ideas had a brain as a speeding train, why did this movie just hit together - chug chug chug - as a slow winter? The disappointment is immense.
