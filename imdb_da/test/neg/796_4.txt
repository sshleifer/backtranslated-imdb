Ha ha. - Oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham are more sensible than this movie. Where to start? Many good things have already been said - so I won't reveal the same area. I think you already have the movie list - so I won't rewrite the movie. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrate the question you were always talking about long car stations when you were kids like (what if you were to choose a family member to live, someone else to die, or if you were to die of drowning or fire) This movie is a good concept - bottom line. The wardrobe group did a fine job of bringing us back to the 70s. Realistic enough, how hard is it to achieve? ..... Okay, it's about everything for the good. Let's talk about the bad ones. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie feels like a 2-hour "Twilight Zone" episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. It could have made the movie bearable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember in the movie "From Dusk to Dawn?" The movie started interesting, so halfway through the movie it just took a degrading trip? Yep - same thing here. I would dare say that the authors started with a concept, so had no idea what to do with it. I've got deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped too much, did not elaborate on the present arch of history and took a (forgiving) completely abusive direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The conclusion did not make sense. Not at all. None. <br /> <br /> This movie would make a great holiday paper in college philosophy 101. If you are on board, you are sick in bed or have ever had it hit the face with a pie and can see this for free on the web - at least go for it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay anything to watch this movie, don't waste your time - you are better off seeing old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganization of your sock drawer.
