The whole exercise is meaningless. Why do the movie at all? The lighting is awful, but the sound is just a joke. Like a high school production. The one who puts the budget together for this movie must be drawn and quartered to make it possible without the right budget for audio players with equipment suitable for recording. <br /> <br /> So much dialogue is incomprehensible due to loss of echo or lack of proximity to the microphone. Economy should have been made in any other area. The whole production is lifeless and just LAME with such amateurish half arsed production. It lacks heat, clarity and has no design for it.
