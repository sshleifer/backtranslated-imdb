Before the airport 79 ', these films were pretty good. They had decent special effects, all-star cast and good acting. This movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for this. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! they are horrific, what the director was thinking about. I know it's only 1979, but let's look at other very good special effects movies like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord and this could have been the best Airport movie, but they did too much with it. What about Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) shooting a flare out of the cockpit window to prevent a heat-seeking missile from hitting the frame. He also makes 90 degree dives and loops. This far far fetched and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, the special effects do not help this scene and are really beyond the poor .... They almost look like a cartoon, and that's how the whole movie is !!! Finally, we can talk about the play that, in my opinion, is extremely poor to fair at best .... Over acting is a big problem in this movie, especially George Kennedy. Like I really like actress, but just don't cut this movie. The full blame is to go to the director who did a very bad editing job and really hit the airport franchise. Too bad Concord is not yet used today, it was a marvel of Air travel ...
