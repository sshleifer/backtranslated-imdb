Stalker Sean Devines background phone scene (outside the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) is played extensively. But in the beginning, it is hard not to miss the fact that one of the suspected sophisticated kills gently twists his foot in a red color on the murder scene. Unfortunately, this is not an intricate plot point; And there is worse story stumbling. Overall, "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend some time if there is nothing better or you are in Lowe and his co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999)) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
