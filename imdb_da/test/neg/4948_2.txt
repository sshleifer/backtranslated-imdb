This is a horrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a classroom and it always does well, but she doesn't get more roles anymore and she needs some money to make this movie. By the way, she is on the screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there's a redemption feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small role in this movie. Now Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not very big, but she has the craziest eyes of any actress I've ever seen. By name you probably don't know her, but you look at her eyes and you recognize her. To sum up, the action is horrible, the story is bad, and even the filmography is horrible. A screen that goes to black every time the instructor wants to change scenes is pretty moronic. See something else, but this, even Mr Ed reruns!
