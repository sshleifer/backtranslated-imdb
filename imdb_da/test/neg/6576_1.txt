I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans are desperately trying to like this movie despite the incredible number of errors. <br /> <br /> Initially, none of the known characters is really so characterful. Scotty is depicted as a bumbling thinker instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can't even think about what they did to her character. His whole dialogue was painful to listen to. McCoy seemed to be a neurotic founder to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... let's just say Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He got a bad dialogue ("I don't think you've understood the gravity of your situation Captain." Gravity, get it? Get it?) And made almost a buffoon. Kirk ... Oh man, don't let me get started. William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with, so letting him lead directly is inviting disaster, which is what we got. The plot is beyond ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a rather desperate story and unnecessary soap opera. But hey, let's go with it. The search for God. Again, a weak plot basis. Don't you think so? OK, let's go with that too. So if you assume that the two above mentioned plate elements are healthy, what is wrong with the script? Well for one thing, it is reused too much. The company, for example, is once again not working properly. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a roughly functioning ship with a skeleton crew to a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to deal with the situation? If so, why not put him on a better ship as an advisor? Adding to it ... the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship broken (and apparently is clumsy enough to encounter his head knocking into unconsciousness while hostile on board!), Nobody seems to notice the Klingon ship is closing at a crucial time (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in the weapon area) and the crew sees everything too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, then it is strange that Klingons had not already crashed the federation. <br /> <br /> Regarding the personal struggles with pain, it was shit. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but he himself could not save this turkey. In short, no one could. Of all the people involved, I can imagine Leonard Nimoy being most embarrassed by it. I hope he is, anyway. Thank God, the original did not throw on this clumsy opus.
