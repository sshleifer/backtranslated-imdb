The sequel that no one asked for the movie, no one wanted. Of course, there are too many mistakes with this movie to mention here, so I will only concentrate on the actor. Miles O'Keefe would have been better suited to playing the spritely Asian sidekick Thong, primarily because he didn't want any dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines with a feeling, dullness. Charles Borremel brings life to his side by pausing every fifth word. And finally, the flamboyant, John Saxon-type guy ...... no comment is needed. See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need, but don't save your time with this low-budget loser.
