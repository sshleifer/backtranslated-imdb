OKAY. First, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is worse than any of the killers' lawsuits -. It made me curious about what people wrote here .. which eventually made me create an account to give my 2 cent's truth to this "error" I find here. How do you dare MENTION this movie in the same phrases like Seven? All they got in common is that they show different crime scenes. That is it. And "Best thriller of 1999!" ? Have you even seen another movie format that year? Or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year that people are reminded of resuscitation ... what about real movies like 8mm, eyes broken, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more of a "thriller" than this could ever be ..). The resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to another of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can't be serious. I saw the movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of her. A "big movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... which I had not seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Now you should first look at the covers: OK, nothing special. At second glance, you do not have to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored Lambert's head, cut his nose and then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it to get the killer's image on COVER. You could even think they had some apprentices eating a gallon of marshmallows just for capturing the creepy (booooh! -.-) mouth .. whatever. Turned it around, and the plot begins with ... "it rains in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Come on, a 6 year old could have made this piece of sound more exciting. Now, with this tremendous excitement coming from the movie's amazing presentation, you'll definitely start to see it. Because it can't be that bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. This assumption of mine was shown wrong. By "proven wrong" I mean it was brutally done by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable play ever known to mankind (every actor but tops are "I can do 1-Liners!" Police Officer, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several events for yet another unclear hint in the case !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme herself) with a squadron of inhuman false feelings, 1 minute logic error - cycle, light-colored conclusions which, in my view, are an insult to any thinking human being, and last but not least, a cameraman who was apparently a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh yes, and if you do not completely close your brains (it is not rooms to see it) then you need to know who is who and what is what after a maximum of 30 minutes simply because you know every scene after the first. It is exciting. Exciting because this movie almost makes you believe you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This is by far the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I have seen many horrible movies that somehow at least were only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. However, the resurrection is the best example of how to fail in every possible aspect. It was so bad that after being shocked by its incredibly low quality in e-v-e-r-y-h-i-n-g, I was playing more often than in any recent comedy simply because I was fascinated by the crew announcement to publish such an extraordinary film strip. Good for Lambert he was in Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be forgiven. ; ^ O <br /> In any case, I recommend watching this movie for ALL. In the end, we had fun watching: ^ D. I guarantee you, after you've seen the Resurrection completely (be brave, can you!), You will worship the level of action in a given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Just go and see Highlander again ... that's what I need to do.
