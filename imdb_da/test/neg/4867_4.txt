It all looked pretty promising. An upcoming presidential consultant is framed by a number of murders, as he has been tipped off by a conspiracy in the White House. It stars the outstanding Donald Sutherland among several talented actors. But very few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> It all really needed a depth. You can get the idea that the president is left with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to stop these ideas being executed. Conrad just seems that the country should rule its way rather than the path to the elected leader. <br /> <br /> But the action scenes had a few logical gaps - the already mentioned robbers and elevators, and pretty random murder - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her "president's father's father" "diversion" was ridiculous - it would do the president at 10 when it happened. Even worse was her predictable final scene with Bishop. They could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either flushed it or failed. They could have gone to the city with special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved so much more generally. This was hardly worth the Â£ 1 it cost me.
