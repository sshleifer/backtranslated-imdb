A colleague from work told me to watch this movie when he found this movie to be one of the best movies ever. So I saw it. First, I must admit that I don't like ordinary movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning. And this is the reason why I don't like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, dull, entertaining, absurd and exciting pieces. <br /> <br /> At first I thought this movie could be a really mysterious thriller (as the German packaging read), but the movie was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may make a combination of the most diverse images, but the composition tastes as awful as a combination of milk with beer. Both for themselves are pretty good, but together?
