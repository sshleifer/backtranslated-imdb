Thomas Edison may have made many good inventions, but WTF is this !!!! I'm sorry, but this movie is simply horrible. The plot is that this elephant goes to a certain point and gets electrocodes. Okay The picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. I thought the early Charlie Chaplin movies were horrible. Okay Thomas Edison may have been an inventor, but why did he make this movie he could have filmed a baby be bold and it would have been better. People can say I'm tough at times, but would you like something like that from here, what I have said, Edison may have made the light bulb, but why did he make this special movie. Well I could sound like a complete #hole but watch this on Youtube then you will see this abomination. I still can't believe this movie is absolutely horrible. All in all, the worst short movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
