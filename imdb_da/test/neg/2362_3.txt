This extremely entertaining Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid was released in my country by a dubious DVD label that usually only records with pure crap on disk, so it wasn't exactly a beneficial thing. Several other titles were released in the same series as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews. None of these belong to the elite of the 70s Blaxploitation hype, none of them. "TNT Jackson" is a rather lousy movie lacking a big plot but has too many ridiculous fighting scenes and horrible plays to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman ?? never too embarrassed to make some easy money? awarded two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simplified story that would appeal to fans of both Oriental Kung-Fu movies and modern trendy Blaxploitation flicks. The result Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came up with was "TNT Jackson"; the tale of an ass humor, black babe traveling to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. She soon discovers that he was killed by a criminal network of drug traffickers and vowed to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson smoothly melts into the underground and meets macho pimps, useful undercover agents, lots of evil Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing is certain; They will all have a piece of TNT's brilliant body somehow. I doubt doubts about movie concepts being more elementary than this, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects also suck. The battle scenes are oblong and also pathetic. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers are trying really hard to stare menacingly and take a tough position, but in the end it is just those who ever do kick in the air and stupid jumps over the rooms. The kinematics are horrible, the soundtrack is very disappointing (what happened to the soul music?), The few dialogues are poorly written and the performances are inferior. Talking about, Jeannie Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but still she can't keep a light on Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only a really good and memorable scene in "TNT Jackson", namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell, quite naked except panties, repeatedly turns on and off the light as you kick hell out of some goons. Entertaining scene ... I just haven't figured out whether it's thanks to the light control ingenuity or Bell's perfectly shaped breasts.
