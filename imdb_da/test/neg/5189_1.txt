About 20 minutes into this lama excuse for a movie, I realized that it reminded me of one of those annoying workplace people who always tell real lame jokes or do extremely unfunny things because they think it's fun and trying to entertain everyone . <br /> <br /> This movie is billed as star-studded Traci Lords, she's not that bad for an actress, but her lines aren't fun, and it's not the star. The play is some of the most terrible thing I've ever seen, except for Lords, the girl who plays Casey, and perhaps the Colonel - who seems oddly out of place. I can't imagine why a retired military colonel would start a SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY. Do they even exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent coaxing these women to make a full length porn feature. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has 3.5 points, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I am amazed by these two movies being within a 1.0 for each other, FGF is "The Godfather" in relation to this waste. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
