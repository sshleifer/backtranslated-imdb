I gave the "Airport 79" only two stars because it is a really miserable movie. No one had anything to do with it deserves some praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) This is not to say that the movie is not worth seeing. It helps if you have a buzz on, but it's not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really seems like an early version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a setup and a payout, and the scenes blunder one after the other as if they were completely interrupted. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, the crew and the plane keep on going anyway. You are a news reporter and a strange guy being murdered in your house in your vicinity? The butcher then shocks you on your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch the early morning flight to Paris ... no need to get the police involved. Your aircraft is dodged an unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles and cannon fires from an unidentified Phantom fighter doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive and a crashed landing without propulsion backers in the process? No problem, we get the mechanics to control the oil and get you on the road in a matter of hours. It is really fun. <br /> <br /> And I admit there is a bit of anarchist in me coming out when the passengers don't pay attention to the cabins. The highlight is when the companion tells Jimmie Walker that he needs to put out his saxophone (God discourages me from a plane sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before starting. Jimmie basically says, "No." Later in the flight, the scissors are damaged under a barrel roll, and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with another scissors that he won't put away. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (One passenger actually adopts the companion. When Charo is told she can't take her dog away, she leaves the plane. Of course, this is because you can't get a good picture of her ass and tits while she is sitting.) /> In summary, a horrible movie but horrible enough to be a little entertaining. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and role deserve nothing for this, as it was quite unintentional.
