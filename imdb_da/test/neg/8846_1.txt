Forget about the miserable play that can be forgiven in this kind of movie. Or even the horrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Far worse is the obvious absence of a skilled or experienced instructor who might have vacationed with the editor while the film was made? When you watch the movie, it feels completely outdated, even though it was only made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? laugh out loud? An Internet connection call? Clucky ghost images photographed on pictures ("He! Look there ... is it .. is it a face?" -Zoom on the face - -Open, the sound breaks off - 'chop' next scene-), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result does not flow at all. You will look at a girl who finds a corpse still hanging from the knot in a scene and then literally 10 seconds later to see her again at some point apparently unaffected, smiling and going. Apart from the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus quite boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Shutter' instead, an oriental (Thai) horror movie done well.
