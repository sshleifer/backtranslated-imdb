Looked at this piece of ONDEMAND because the description was a little foreign. This movie stinks of cocaine, only with the opening scene costing at least five characters in battle for movies. This is a racist, homophobic piece of waste that plods together for a good 1 hour and 22 minutes with absolutely no direction. I'm a little confused as to how this has good reviews here. I will not bother telling you the plot line, as far as I can tell there is no plot. I am pretty sure everyone showed up until they put every day, the big lines, dressed Loretta Switt in offensive necklace to show as much flapjack as possible and shouted action; let the player improvise in a cocaine phase. Like real beer, this movie almost caused my liver to fail halfway through. Save your money and see 'Strange Brew' instead.
