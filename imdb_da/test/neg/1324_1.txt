I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something like each other - a realistic war film showing solidists and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and the pain of battle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to be written by a third degree and led by a fifth grade student. Larger pieces of the film simply appear missing, making it completely uneven. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but does not appear better in the mother tongue; You only have to see the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
