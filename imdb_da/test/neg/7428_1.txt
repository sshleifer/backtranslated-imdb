I got this thing from the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid. I had rented the other and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. This one was quite unpleasant. The "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two assistant female cyborgs were so horrible that I literally rang every time they came on the screen. The reason left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I don't know what anyone thought when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they would have made it better to have left it on 2 movies. The films in this series go from good to decent to terrible. I just hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torture unit.
