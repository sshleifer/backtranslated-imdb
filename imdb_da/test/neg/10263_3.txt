The movies use blue-blue and live skin tones to create a noir-ish feeling on this movie, unfortunately it doesn't work. In fact, it is quite annoying as it dampens the demon characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. <br /> <br /> At least the original had a hysterical energy, and gore set pieces were quite amazing. Black Gore is hardly scary, nor is the biggest female demon at all scary in her attempt to sneak and grill on the screen of his best camp of Lugosi style. <br /> <br /> The story is roughly uneven and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you can appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, this film gives a wide circumference. Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.
