Ni√±as Mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy ill-conceived soap opera. <br /> <br /> The play is not a bit better of it in soap operas, I think the author and director have seen too many Mexican soap operas and cannot perceive anything externally different. <br /> <br /> Give it up, go back to your soap operas so you get an audience to please. <br /> <br /> Stop waking our time and money and give a bad name to the once respected Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> It's NOT an OK or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
