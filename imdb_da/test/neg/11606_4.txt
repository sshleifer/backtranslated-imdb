"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of the not so well-known American American hitchcocks movies. But if the "lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the thriller in the time (the early 40s) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth is not to discover this movie really a lost. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an average and conventional screw basketball comedy where it is quite difficult to find Hitchcock's touch. Maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow (it's not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is capable of (but it's well hidden in an impersonal package), in a dizzying scene where two of the characters are trapped upstairs of a fair attraction, and perhaps in the mother's character. And it's about it! Even for the Hitchcock tab there is nothing to connect with. <br /> <br /> And for screwed-up comedy amateur there is not much more: none of the situation is exaggerated enough to be really fun, and we are far from the masterpieces of hawks for example. And if one or two scenes are very funny, there's not even the funniest thing in Hitchcock's filmography that created comic situations in almost all of his films (even "Psycho" could be considered full of very dark humor). So there is really little to save in this movie that can, without annoying anyone (or perhaps only both hardcore fans of Hitchcock and screwball comedy that are in love with Carole Lombard), remain one of the not so well-known early American Hitchcock's movie.
