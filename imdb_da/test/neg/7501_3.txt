The most important precondition for this movie is any woman's imagination: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well, at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever struggled with a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry that it is not a gory kind of men's eating. It is more like a comic slurping them in as a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left. So for blood, gut and good fans, forget about this movie, not much here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters in the movie are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a lovely guy who steals Helen. The story is already a little stupid at this time, but then they throw in two more equally stupid sub-stories that just send this movie to the bad B-movie area. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding new love with a few contiguous twins; and then one of them kills eventually and becomes a fleeting bank robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen finding new love with a handsome policeman who rescued her from a prostitution-bad date and decided he wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet at the end of the movie in incredible circumstances, and magic Helen's murderous vagina is cured!
