Dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no money Sofia Coppola's early brief is almost necessarily a sight on a high school campus. The cast is rather weak and does not benefit from being shot in b & w (it is difficult to tell the characters apart). The audio editing does nothing to help a simple story of incredible teenage fidelity. But there are one or two things to note. Inamongst is the inconsistent editing of high school campus filmed with a balance between aspiring and intimate close-ups. The editing for music also creates an interest and momentum (without descending into Music Video's netherworld). Coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film. The dramatic trip is cut quickly and to the point, and the second action is almost non-existent; we recognize that it has actually been played with the first, which is the point of the narrator-on-crutches trope (which is an otherwise curious added character in the first action). Despite these notes it is an awkward card. 2.10
