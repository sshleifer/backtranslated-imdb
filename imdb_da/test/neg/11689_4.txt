Initially, I once met the director as he was going to WW2 recordings with a movie film period and making videos of the events that looked good. I really wish he'd kept it up. Because as much as I welcome what he did on a clear "almost nothing" budget when I popped out on the DVD, I just wondered why I sat through almost two hours nothing. There is no real plot to talk about, you really do not care about what happens to the characters (maybe the Italian troops and some of the Germans), and the end is another "art film" commentary on the war. I could have told someone how it would end when I got through the first ten minutes. I knew the Germans would have a few heroic volunteers to fight to death, I knew most of the Quartmaster GIs would be killed, it was just too darned obvious! And while I'm on the subject, I was shocked to see so much of Axis's side done well, but the GI side made it comical. All character development was evident for non-English speaking roles. The GIs were simply accelerated hard in this movie. And I can't wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the US Army works? The sentences, terminology, actions, were clearly written by a person without knowledge of the US military at all.
