One should have the right to expect people who make a film on the second and third testaments that they had read the other two or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and doomsday. This film contains absolutely nothing relevant to viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy. There is only British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs. In fact, good candidates for a true third will have been released several times - as "a course of miracles" or "conversations with God". They all have thought-provoking new phrases and angles for Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in IMDb's assessment is not the number of stars, but how many people have bothered to vote. For four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this movie. As usual, the enthusiasts are most eager. For comparison, look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - original version from 1973.
