I do not understand it. I just don't understand that. "Barney and Friends" has been lambasted by millions over the years and I will admit that I was one of those lambasters. Any child looking at this show does not understand that what they see is just a piece of trash can. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop and it gets even worse. Add B.J., then you have a very scary tv nightmare. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing in the first place? It would be fun if Barney and his friends showed up at the Jerry Springer show. It would definitely be one of the wildest moments in the TV story! Even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of the public television as we knew, since we have seen less and less of the more informative and interesting public television programs broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. 's. What a big difference a selfish son of a gun does. When this show leaves PBS, a great sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a big crunch will be made in the annals of television history. A message to Barney himself: You can't realize it, but YOUR DAY is numbered. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are other choices. Better choices.
