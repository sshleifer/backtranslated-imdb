This film was horrible, especially considering the work that has to be done in its production. Although it's not as bad as Ax Em, it's pretty terrible. Take into account the obvious rip-offs of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This smorgasbord with terrible makeup and wooden plays. <br /> <br /> The movie starts as most zombie films do today. An assembly of interesting jumps and a radio broadcast of the outbreak at hand. We see our hero (Ryn, possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in modern era, counted in four or five times, when he either scratched his head with his gun barrel or looked down into the barrel while he was blowing) cutting fingers off zombies. We learn later that these fingers are gathered for treasure. <br /> <br /> Now, Ryn seems to be a rebellion in his ways of handing out zombies; goes as far as buying chum * gasp * from his French friend Hans (who is not really French speaking with an odd Middle Eastern accent). As Ryn uses chum to collect a plentiful bounty from Lost Hills, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And the cue movie is horrible. Overall, the zombies are pretty bad. I've seen comments that praised their make-up, but it was totally amateur in my opinion. Clear Halloween adhesives were used to make the zombies' faces, and there were points where a girl looked as if she donated a clown mask instead of a freshly scaled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To sum up the next sixty minutes up in a few lines: Ryn has stuck back by Hans (who made an appointment with some other zombie hunters, Blythe is the lead), gives him a second chance, gets back broken by Hans, then shoots Hans and comes to Union City where he finds Blythe poisoning cities for profit. That's right about plot. When Ryn reaches Union City, all the evil is gathered in a house that is apparently so massive that it takes Ryn hours to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of these cynical "should he kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * I have to blame most of this mess on Nott. The direction was horrible. Each character accounted for a different scowl than Hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this group of MacBeth rejects. When they come to Union City, a shadow of the zombies attacks the crew, and the zombies, of course, got no tips or ideas on how to go as if your appendages were rotten. A woman swaying as if she were swimming in the middle of the air on a Sunday path. <br /> <br /> Some movies are horrible. This movie is one of them just because of how the logic seemed to be abandoned to keep a story flowing. Occasionally works, but in that respect (where the story was already in shambles), it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.
