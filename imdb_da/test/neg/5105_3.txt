I was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie is it, so I suppose I shouldn't complain. Twentysomething Tom (gay boy Robert Stadlober) has so many problems that he does not know if he is coming or going. I would not have stayed, but for the beautiful girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); no-nonsense Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as the star's movie in the movie. And then there is Tom's soul family, wild-eyed Margarete (Jana Pallaske). She reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, it's good memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous clothes, and I mean ridiculous, even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was the age of the character. My guess is that I wouldn't. Beware of indie idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder from "Der Hund Marie" as street musicians, do not feel painful.
