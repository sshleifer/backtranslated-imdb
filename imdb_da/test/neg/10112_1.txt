Hello guys and girls! Never rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of waste. I have rarely seen a movie in any genre as bad as this one. The action is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in 1st grade had to shop in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, if we were to be compared with the players in Darkhunters, we would have been included for evaluation for Oscars. The story is horrible, the makeup is horrible, the movie is horrible, the set is terrible, the management is horrible, etc. I can't actually find anything worth using the money to watch this movie .. Perhaps except for all the cats my boyfriend thought was sweet. Please use your money on things other than this movie .... I couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so terrible. If anyone really likes this movie, I would really like to hear from you and I will try to see if I can get you counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, actually below, if possible .. Not worth the DVD or tape it is on ..
