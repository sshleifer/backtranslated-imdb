The movie Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title and leading role. Now most people may not like this movie for the plot and the play was a little cheap, but it is the appeal of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way it should be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> But if you see this movie all the way through the end, you see it's like I said a cheap vampire girl with a little humor. (Also how the manipulated colors in a few scenes are very interesting.) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is a type you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy what it is. For no movie is pretty much bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says, "People just don't smile enough ..."
