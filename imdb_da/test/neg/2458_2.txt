What I came away with after watching this movie was a guilty conscience. The movie itself has a pretty fascinating plot line and prerequisite for it, but unfortunately it's a movie you can't see without being bombarded with pornography. If you plan to see this and have a moral problem with the breakdown of the marriage action for an audience's viewing experience, then you make a big mistake. This is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip onto your DVD player. Near the beginning of the movie, Baldwin's character is video recording of his sexual exploits without knowledge of his partner. This tape and others like it continue to appear throughout the movie at unpredictable times. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about women's dignity. Ironically, they made more women for prostitutes. I only gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because they had handled Baldwin's promiscuity better, it would have been an interesting movie.
