Okay, we went along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explained to our son who was adopted from Russia that this was over-the-top acting and dramatization so we could get to the dog playing football (when playing football). But the last scene where the dog goes back to its original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes, "he has been replaced !!!!" This from an elementary child. I DO NOT recommend this movie to any family having an adopted child; It shows adoption, orphanages and adults badly - and eventually, even if they win the game - the dog that the boy has tied together must leave - and that's too much. Be careful if you have some adopted children and watch out for families with biological children because the impression of children adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and uncomfortable. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie ....)
