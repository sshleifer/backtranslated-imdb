You must not be fooled by the plot outside, as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story of this seems quite interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I have ever had ... Clearly and truly, it is a must and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot is exciting, reflect on this: phones can move, drive, and kill people who can also do other electrical appliances. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS MOVIE, this is a disgrace to the horror genre ...
