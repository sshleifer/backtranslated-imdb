Just finished watching this movie when it was playing on TV, and I had nothing else to do. Went right here to IMDb also look at the trivia page and happened to look at the user's comments. And what do I find? Every stupid idiot raises this movie to heaven! I wouldn't have written anything myself, but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this sigh-ass movie, I thought I could. The play sucked from virtually everyone in the play. The worst was the guy who played Brian Wilson (think I got the name right) when he overcame, especially when he was tall. The rest was not as bad as him, but neither was nor good. I'm not an expert on the beach boys though so can't really complain about the story so much .... except it sucked though. No motivation for any of the character's decisions most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in reality. And what I found worst was that I thought it should be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only got a few signs. I hate when they do it in movies, the same thing in the doors, even though I like that movie more. Don't have any energy left to write more ... it sucked! Don't buy or see it!
