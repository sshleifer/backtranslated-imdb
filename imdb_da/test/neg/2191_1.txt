I read all the other comments that made this movie an excellent movie. I saw nothing of the excellent that was said. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to see it. The first time I fell asleep, and the second time, I did it within six minutes of the end and gave up. I suppose it was mainly my fault that went in with great expectation, but I don't think this would have ruined the movie completely for me. The movie was just bland. It had nothing spectacular or unique to it. The plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue was forced, and the movie just went on forever. I would not recommend watching this movie.
