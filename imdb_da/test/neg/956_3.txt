"D.O.A." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Jankel. The action is okay and the manuscript is pretty bad. This movie also has some moments that make you laugh at how stupid violence scenes are <br /> <br />. For example, someone shot near a window. We see from the outside <br /> <br /> the building, what looks like the person who jumped. I laughed my head when this happened. This movie is trying hard but ultimately fails. Just watch this movie <br /> <br /> when you have no other choice. <br /> <br /> My Criticism: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> Rating Causes: Violence and Language. * <br /> * There was no justification for its age.
