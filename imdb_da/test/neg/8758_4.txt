Oh, horror! I've seen a lot of gore movies in my time, but this one just makes me laugh with laughter rather than rejection. This is definitely a crazy movie and is very low budget I can add, but if you are able to look past the cheap sound, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes and the general cheeziness of the movie, then you might find some of this movie to be something entertaining. The story is about a cop killer who dies every five days, the fifth month of the fifth year (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of which gave a brave effort by trying to make the scary dialogue good) to stop the killer's bloody rage. Killed scenes (which are made with a plastic toy knife) are quite brutal (which is a good thing) but very annoying because of the constant repetition of a clearly recorded scream (which is very ear piercing). Regarding gore, there is plenty of it, but it looks very fake; especially the blood, c'mon, purple blood? But if you're a fan of gore videos like myself, you'll find something in this video to cherish as I did (the crap-talking detective ... he's the best thing for this movie). Apart from that, all you will find is a bunch of pointless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad is the girls OOOGLY) and a very idiotic hippy necrophilic serial killer. Sorry, but this sucks.
