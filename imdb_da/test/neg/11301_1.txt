Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that is very overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. Hannibal is bad, horrible, unlucky, lame, droll, idiotic, constructed, ridiculous, and totally horrible (no saying calculated). Smaller spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This movie has big logical gaps - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplifies the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a great Hollywood production designed to get into Hannibal Lector Mania, directed by "HÃ¥kan-he-take-this-for-serious" hack director Ridley Scott and produced by a hack Italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "no matter if movies are s ** t, money is good." <br /> <br /> I can't get over the fact that acclaimed writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this trip adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned hack writer Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and incredibly talented screenwriters - wasted their efforts on a poor manuscript in exchange for bold paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes to list that are ridiculous in lumpy execution and bad logic for example. Starling / Pazzi mobile phone in the middle of Lecter pursuit, showing Inspector Pazzi as the victim. Not to mention the ridiculously bad dialogues provided by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can't deal with that straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" with hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on demanding revenge against Lecter. The gore effect is good, but serves only to repel rather than give tension, which is particularly absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - the silence of the lamb - is more credible with excitement and excitement. Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular blend of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention excellently written and indulgent. The "brain dinner" sequence is so ridiculously fake it borders on self-parody. The end is a little obvious and idiotic - should we believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot Creating his glittering eye dressed in you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
