This script was mildly original when it was written in 1935, but the bad notions and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend. Some of the vignettes are horrible and the dialogue is never natural. A couple of plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at IMDB. A few scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that, if it doesn't succeed completely, entertain. If you like this kind of montage, don't run and get "Tales of Manhattan" (1942) a great movie that follows the life and times of a topcoat.
