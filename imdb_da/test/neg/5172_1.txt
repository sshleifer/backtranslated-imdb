Oh dear, just what we need for another Essex-Kockney waste effort chronically the rise of the British footy hooligan / rave gangster who obviously followed West 'am (East Londan / Essex style). Didn't anyone tell you they won the world hat? And, of course, the inevitable decay of British rave culture underworld. Blah blah blah. Why, how and who would like to fund a movie like this, I don't know, but let's ask that it was from private finance (we can see ex-drug dealers, grocery banks - we all know what to call them and the rest of Mockneys) rather than publicly funded funds. Hopefully, with the recession, we will not look like this again. If we do, we will call the death watch for British movies and of course we will all blame Britains number one Mockney Country gent wannabee gangster Guy Ritchie.
