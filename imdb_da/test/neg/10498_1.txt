I couldn't spend ten minutes on this horrible movie. In and at the age of DV cameras, it appears to have been shot on VHS without the aid of any color correction or microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker myself, I know the limitations of indie filmmaking and even keeping those things in mind I am amazed that movies can be done badly. <br /> <br /> The only praise I can offer is that this movie was distributed as I have seen significantly better movies still seeking modest domestic or international release. I guess the box is, what sold it ... it has good box art, but it all goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Page Note: It seems the director has 11 friends since no one on this planet would give this movie a "10".
