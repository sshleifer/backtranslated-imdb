I really didn't like this movie ~ !!!! It was boring and didn't interest me so much. I'm more of an action girl, and it had none. I went and rented this movie because of the second comment that was left .. but was totally misled! Don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and lots of boredom. I just didn't like the movie. it was not my style but it could be yours .. you just had to see the previews or something, but that's my recommendation if you are a girl .. don't get this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of the observation strategies in Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi, so that we can reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping views. this is just not for me!
