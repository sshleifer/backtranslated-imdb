************* SPOILERS BELOW ************* "Night, Mother" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who quietly announces to her brash mother (Anne Bancroft) that she will commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. The brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat - the story that follows, lacks in substance, gravity and revelation value. Where are the shocks and surprises that mother and daughter have that may be the last conversation in their lives? Where are the secrets revealed, announcements and fantasies and sorry? They are here, but they have all been painted the same boring color that keeps emotions in the background and celebrates the actor Marsha Norman's genius at the expense of everything else. The result is not a movie, but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me explain my comments by saying that I find Sissy Spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of the movie, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom. She brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I've seen her rescue more than a movie from the recycle box with her English face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I initially saw this movie, and for one of her movies to be horrible, it must fail in a significant way. This movie fails in two. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is so faithfully adapted from Pulitzer winning stage games that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole movie is a two-woman dialogue between Jesse and her mother. What worked on stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house nozzles on film. A game, no matter how big, needs to be customized * to the screen ?? It is self-reliant and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that it cannot be changed by a word of it. The manuscript for this movie could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a well-known scriptwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and competent Bancroft some * physical * sequences, some facial reactions, something to break up into the wall for wall yak celebration and prison-like single- seen. It is no wonder that the manuscript was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who might know theater, but turns out to be unclear in film. I can't overload the effect the scene game script has on the movie. Looking at Jesse and her mother arguing about Ises impending suicide is superfluous and boring. The women walk from the living room into the kitchen in the cave and back into the living room where they start again. A small Midwestern house is not the ideal place for a single-set movie, and the director never tries anything smart or original, never tries to break the monotonous with an outer shot or cutaway or a flashback or * something *. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... only two women cover the couch and support their opinions. The reverence given to the doctor is the disease? Even Shakespeare's most solemn classics are shaken to the screen. Commitment to the original game seems almost saliva ?? It is as if the film was only made to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage game, with the audience thinking. <br /> <br /> The other reason why the movie fails is Anne Bancroft. She can be a good stage actress, but on film - where the presence is 80% of the performance - she rarely seems to care. She certainly doesn't fit here, playing a midwestern grandmother, but looks more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. She chases Jesse around the house, looks more exasperated than amazed and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic, even when her lines convey a loving, if flawless woman. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is great as she always is, honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character choices. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had any bad break and made for many wrong choices. She has never had control over her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying "No more - this is where I go away." How she says it anyway, and when Spacek speaks ?? you listen. She shows in all her films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, does not have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone. In this and in films such as "Coal Miner's Daughter" she demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic ?? You can't help falling in love with it. It was hard for me to see "Night, Mother." Spacek is wasted in a stalked stunt of a movie that never serves to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except die-hard fans of Sissy like myself and even then you will be disappointed. I give the film a whole letter course bonus to the end, which is brave enough to let the protagonist do what suits * her * and not pans to a hackneyed happy ending. GRADE: C
