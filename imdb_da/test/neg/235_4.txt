First of all, I wasn't sure who this movie was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids, but had things in it, the kids wouldn't understand and find boring. There wasn't much to it, Bruce Willis was not stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with half his smile - unless you're a big fan of his I wouldn't bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but lacks emotionally, learns lessons from a child), I would go to see if a boy. It has everything this movie lacked, humor, sadness and reality.
