Why can't a movie be considered zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so bad they are funny to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. "The Fange of Horror" may be the worst movie I have ever seen (anyway. I HAD to fast forward with everything!). Luckily for my youth's indiscretion and senility in my advanced age there may be worse movies I've seen, but fortunately I can't remember them. The sets seemed to be made with cardboard and finished with cans with spray paint. The special effects resembled a fifth degree C + diorama in a shoe box. The movie contained unforgiving gaffs as when marquis shoots and kills his servant. He immediately enters a battle with his fleeting victim who takes his flintlock and shoots it without the gun being reloaded! This movie was so bad, my DVD copy only had name credits. I don't think any company or studio would be incriminated. Although I guess when you film in your garage and make sets of cardboard boxes, a study is not necessary. This movie surely reaches into my basement of all time worst movie with such horrible sacrileges as "The Manipulator", the worst movie I have ever seen with a real (once) Hollywood-leading man Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend seeing "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "The Manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone was paying you. (I'm a little cheap) I need $ 7 or $ 8 bucks for "Dungeon" and at least ten for "Manipulator". never filed out of the canine cinematographer
