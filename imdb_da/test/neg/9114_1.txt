I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the movie as a few overtime tumbleweeds (probably back from a poor western) blew across the stage. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the mandatory opening of strangers, who were not obvious, lowered his rearview mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits, we are dealt with an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth, and only the dramatic television movie music informs us that a killing is taking place, not a make-out session. For the next 27 hours, we are treated to two idiotic psychotics, which for some reason seem to be forced to drive through the desert southwest alongside one another as a dubbed Abbot & Costello. Even with the "shocking" turns at the end, we are only going to shake our heads and wonder if manufacturers and instructors / writers feel ashamed and embarrassed as they should have to create this inconsistent rubbish.
