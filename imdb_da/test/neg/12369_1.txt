San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is older, and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheens younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from various lines. There are probably ways to draw at least one watchable movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. First of all, much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an indulgent mother? Certainly a city in the size of San Francisco, a few professional players are willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, have other talents as a landscape producer or waitress, they should fine-tune. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as "The Killer") is also quite awful in a psychologically ill-mannered way, but I am almost willing to give him the benefits of the doubt, since his character is written in zero or personality . A boring, almost ridiculous serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC family movie this week. There is no nudity or violence to speak of, and the R class is evident for adult style pacing. This movement winds like an 85-year-old woman runs with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like his lower jaw was being removed. I didn't expect a good movie when I rented San Franpyscho, but I didn't expect the mind numbing boredom either.
