While the Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven - with some great episodes, some miserable and many in between. Don't believe in the deadly fans - there were some stinkers, and that was definitely one of them. In a plot that obviously meant being an attack on Fidel Castro, a near lookalike (Peter Falk in lots of makeup and beard) gets a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are, so he can settle them. While I think Castro is a dew and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will confirm this), it's amazing how this kind of preachy episode actually makes the audience laugh at American efforts to marginalize creeps and actually making Castro seem okay !! Think of it - Serling and company would hurt Castro, but instead it seemed to be obvious, predictive and stupid in the process. It's really bad - almost ridiculously bad when seen today.
