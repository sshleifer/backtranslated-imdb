Okay, last night on August 18, 2004, I had the particular dissatisfaction with meeting Mr. Van Bebble on a show of the movie The Manson Family at Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second, in a short Q & A session after the show, Mr Van Bebble immediately said that he had never had any contact with the actual Manson family members or Charlie himself and called them liars and said he would not have anything to do with to make the film based on his (van bebble's) try to have seen everything from his living room on television and in the news (and I assume from the autobiography and book heroes skeletons that were directly imitated through the story). So I had other dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drug and rock-roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question apparently pissed off the now sloshed director who started shouting "f *** you close f *** up, this is the truth! All the other movies are bullsh **!" <br /> <br /> Yet, I didn't even wonder how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the movie, "You've heard the law's side of the story ... now hear the story being told of the Manson family. "Excuse me, if this guy has never spoken to the family and considers them to be liars, he doesn't want anything to do with, how can he tell the story to them in God's name? This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film, of course, catered for the sex drugs and the rock'n'roll audience that it had no trouble attracting the tiny, dimly lit theater and was even more clearly formed by the sex drugs and rocket key content of a man who could not even see its own movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer or to shout a kind of rocky horroresque call line for the actors on the screen. This movie achieves a little more than arouse the public's image of the actual events (which helped shape the state of the United States and much of the world today) into a kind of Slasher / Comic Book / Porn / Rape fantasy dreamed of by an overtly low individual. br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely impressive to watch. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie's work with the family out of his Lie album. The editing was great and choppy to simulate the unusual uncertainty about most modern music videos. All in all, this movie would have made a much better addition to the catalogs on Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or, for that matter, any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror watching the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie, who looked a kind of rocky Dungeon and Dragons enthusiast more than the real role he portrayed. The descriptions that the movie gave him as full of energy, throwing ten things in you and being very physical about it all the time, did not match all the slow, dull and lumpy representations that were actually presented. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film explains itself as Sadie (or perhaps it was Linda) declaring at the end: "You can write a bunch of bullsh ** books or make a lot of bullsh ** movies, etc. Etc. Etc. " Case in point. Even the "true story" disclaimer is a dead giveaway signaling that somewhere under this psychedelic trash is the foundation of a true story of content that will and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the villain, or maybe, just avoid everything and read a book instead. All I can say is that when the movie ended, I got a free beer, so I'm glad I went, but not so happy that I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to close f *** to ask the director a question. Peace.
