I saw the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The reason was a bit confusing. There is a voice-over in the introduction of an 800-year war, and I didn't really understand it. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie indicates). The couple have an argument and Meredith Monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The girlfriend finds a group of vampires who do not kill people and fight the cyclists. A human group of slayers is somehow involved and the final battle sequence takes place during a solar eclipse. This movie is not related to Vampires or Vampires: Los Muertos. Confusing but decent action. Four out of 10 stars.
