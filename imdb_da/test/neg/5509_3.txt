OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane, but you must love a movie where the women are always topless. There are also some catfights and some kinky sex. On the other hand, I hope they do not overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here is a good example. After one of the imprisoned girls dies: <br /> <br /> "This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "A relative?" "No, my favorite shoe." I guess they save some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like the plastic crocodile. I would say that it took me three meetings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I think that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the people waiting to rent it were not too impatient. Don't worry about people, that's the way.
