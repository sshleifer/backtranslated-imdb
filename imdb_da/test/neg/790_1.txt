Now this movie is the worst I have ever seen !! It is simply a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I just wasted my time watching this cheap crap. I can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. Nothing to learn from this movie, it's just a hollow sick evil flick. I don't think they could make it worse, this movie just earned its title as the king of the lowest crap. The action is a disaster, the meaning ... the good, there is no point just a sick pain and grief introduced by the suffering child at the end of the movie, and the killing of the wife, which in turn was another stupid blow on this movie . Do yourself a favor if you actually have some self-respect, stay away from this terrible !!!
