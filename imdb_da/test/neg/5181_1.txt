This movie is beyond Horrible AVOID ALL COSTS !! I want my hour and 20 minutes back !!! <br /> <br /> Not fun In general, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. Swears jump out of the speakers like a waterfall, each becoming more annoying than last, and not contributing to the comedy OR plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!). All in all, it's a lame-a $ 5, water-down-typed "Out Cold" ish movie - but terribly horrible. The film focuses on two groups of a town Poories and Richies (how obviously stupid is that?), Where the two contradictions have snowboarding matches with each other. (The story looks like a 4-year-old sitting story without all swords and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can't give any lower score
