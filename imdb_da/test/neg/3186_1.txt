This is one of the star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled in place. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic "b." Goldie Hawn recently commented on "Town and Country" that it is a major problem in Hollywood that they start hiring the actors and put together a deal before a script is completed. You have to note that they did not just go into this picture without a complete script, they also lacked it daily. Maybe we should send cards and letters to the head of the entire studio, saying, "It's the script, stupid." <br /> <br /> This is also one of the films where you feel pampered by the actors most of the way through. They work their donkeys out to try to make all this seem hysterical, but they know that most of it is not accompanied by the stomach laughs, but by the sound of the crickets you can hear in silence theater. <br /> Is it an incredible disaster? Not quite. There are some smiles along the way, mainly because of the players' efforts. I would probably have gone out of theatrical thinking, "Eh. It was okay." So why the unthinkable hostile tone in my review? The end. If, as has been noted, the rest of the movie is just a setup for the end, it misses spectacularly. I really wish I could talk specifically about it, but I hate people who give too much away (even in warning). Suffice it to say as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent Paul Traveler (nothing given away here. It's in the trailer), take the hell out of the theater and go out and think, "Oh. It was okay." The rest of the film is dressed and creative bankruptcy. And you will be shocked that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you loved "There is something about Mary" or "Meet the parents" (both big movies), don't look at this movie. Go, these teeth have taken care of instead.
