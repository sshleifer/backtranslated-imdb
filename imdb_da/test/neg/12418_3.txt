If you decide to see the Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie exploring the relationship and structure of a motorcycle band, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an exposure to the degradation of the American education system and the problem of juvenile abuse, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie exploring how underground rural politics is facing a well-funded, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after the scene of accidental humor, horrible plays, a paper thin plot and community theater production values, Wild Rebels is the right movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a down-on-his-luck stock-car driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a burning crash (as Rod goes away completely unscathed despite only having a cotton pants and a London Fog style jacket for protection), Rod decides to give it up. With no plans for his future, except to walk effortlessly through the South's returning roads, he stumbles on Satan's English motorcycle bands (a gang of three of the stupid boys ever laying on a leather jacket and a woman they seem to be part of) . This group of hoodlums spend their time terrorizing a Florida homestead by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some major crimes they have planned. Apparently these three Einsteins can only drive cars with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to do bold daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be able to hold the car in the middle of a dirt road during a low-speed chase. Eventually they are holding up a bank, entering the above-mentioned low-speed chase, and having the lameest armed conflict with the police ever put on film. I could go on forever, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the word "so bad, it's good", but it seems enough to describe the Wild Rebels.
