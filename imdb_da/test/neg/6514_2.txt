Two LA cops track a serial killer with the nickname "Family Man" who has wiped out entire families, and when one of the police officer's wife takes the six deep, the questions raise, and it turns out that a serial killer is not responsible, but rather gangsters . The idea of ​​Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept and one can see Seagal playing a good serial killer, but making him a policeman who has a ridiculous penchant for prayers and razor-sharp credit cards come out more stupid than just ridiculous. Also, an ongoing joke involves Wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this rested material is completely out of place. Not to mention the start of a school taken hostage, due to a boy's collapse with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, her boyfriend tells the young boy that she loves him.

I myself would think flowers or the old-fashioned phone call might work, so again though I'm old-fashioned. In addition to who should I put a damper on another's brilliant reconciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
