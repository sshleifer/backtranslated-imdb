The brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and occasionally unpleasant comedy that was snatched back from the release after a few days. Drunken, lecherous Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson accidentally puts an Arab potentat on fire in the United Nations and sent to his small country as a punishment, arriving just like a palace coupe putting a new leader (American soap star Thaao Penghlis) on the throne. Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), accidentally follows an arrangement of the new leader to release a deadly, obnoxious, AIDS-like virus in the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo as US female president, her desk top reading "President Rivers"! Extremely bad taste bread with slapstick and Humphries' usual screaming satire in a movie that is more comfortable in it are many fun parts than overall as a whole. Lady Edna's TV fans may be amazed by the presence of another Madge Allsop, unfortunately, one who lacks Emily Perry's wonderful killing comedy magic in the role. The film was written by Humphries & his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by Mad Max's husband, George Miller. For die-hard Humphries fans like myself are crucial. Everyone else, beware.
