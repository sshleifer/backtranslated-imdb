This crock of doodoo won a prize? They must have been desperate to give a price for something. This movie series of teeny bopper things and it made me sick. Luckily I saw it with MST3K's Mike and bots, so it made it bearable. Horrid acts, disturbing mom / daughter moment, stupid premise, if you want a bad movie here it is. Be warned though, see it with Mike and bots or you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. I still can't believe it won a prize and the director defends this * && $$ # $ ^ && piece of ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
