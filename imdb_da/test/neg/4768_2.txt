I've seen a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately, and have found a lot to like about them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed much fainter than all the others I've seen. Maybe it's because it's a comedy / horror movie rather than just horror, and maybe it's also because humor didn't register me very well. It's a little less than seventy minutes long, and credits begin as the last ten minutes begin. There are some outtakes, goofs and behind the scenes things going on while these credits roll. SRE films tend to be short and tend to feel padded despite it. This is no exception, with some scenes tending to take too long. The story involves a poor child in Christmastown, California, who had been picked by all of his classmates. He had had a shoe stolen and could not replace it, he was called "Oneshoe McGroo." Because of an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him a Christmas lock with a Christmas tree on the emblem on the eyelid. Many of the classmates are killed and the few who stay together decide what to do. They are picked out one by one by McGroo who stems around to the sound of blur bells ringing. People are basically all broad stereotypes that the geek is called Dorkus etc. There is a strange scene where a kinky couple has sex the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man carrying a large paper watermelon slice over his head. This reminded me of some of the alien sex scenes from director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> Image quality is good and there are many extras. But basically a pretty stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, I think you can never have too many Christmas fear movies. Still, there are many other needy vacations.
