For people who have absolutely no idea what a comedy is. It includes not only the people who liked this movie, but the people who did it. What could they have thought of? Madonna plays Judy Holliday? Please, she can't even play MADONNA (if there is actually a Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne was paid well. He deserved every penny he got, because if it didn't kill his career, nothing would. I am sure the few people who actually paid to watch this movie left what their pockets had been picked. Madonna is apparently beyond the point where she felt embarrassed by her almost complete lack of talent as an actress, yet you may not feel embarrassed about her anyway. She has no connection with the rest of the casting; it looks as if she appeared on the set and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm going to scare myself by making the absolute worst Judy Holliday impression ever seen, now getting out of the way" and then continuing to do just that. I know that the term "rotten Madonna movie" is superfluous, but it certainly fits this. It is painful to see a scary and talented "actress" making a complete fool of herself, but apparently it does not disturb her as she does it over and over. <br /> <br /> The only distant fun of this "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to do it. Now it's fun.
