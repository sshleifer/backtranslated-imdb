Scenarist Frederick Fox sometimes memorable dialogue and a study of ancient benefits cannot save this lukewarm Western on the white attached to the desert by a band of bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. Apart from his occasional exciting dialogue, you will not find any surprises in Fox's play about this white and Indian inlet. The characters in the "Dakota Incident" only generate less interest, certainly not enough to make them stop as much as some of Fox's election dialogs. Unfortunately, a good dialogue is Fox's only contribution because this conventional little sagebrush meets with a noisy ending that contradicts its past 80 minutes. The end is as constructed as it comes and lacks credibility. Most of the characters are sympathetic, but some are simply a lack of common sense. Dale Robertson is appropriately hard and leathery as forbidden by John Banner, one of three bank robbers who will shoot it out with his low-down, no-account partners. Veteran Western character actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) is best bathed while Skip Homeier, wasted in a conflicting role as Banner's brother Frank Banner, later dies from an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to shoot down Banner at the beginning of the action, but our left-handed pistol jump hero fails his own death, jumping down Largo later and dragging leather with him in a town called Christian Flats. Of course, Largo supports the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers on a stage coach from Christian Flats to Laramie turns out to be none other than the bank from which he stole the money. Not only is John Carter (John Lund) on his quest to find Banner, but also he will clear his own good name with the bank that issued the desired posters for the arrest. Obviously, the authorities have lost and expanded Carter's role in the robbery. Carter is ready to take the banner to Laramie and turn him to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner ideas change when he crosses paths with Amy Clarke (former Twentieth Century Fox beauty Linda Darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a breast. As everyone else mentioned in their reviews, Republic Studio's Truecolor brings out RED in all, from Darnell's download outfit to the blood spilled on the ground. The problem with director Lewis Foster's handling of this mill otter is that everything is bogging down after the stage lifter loses a wheel and our heroes cave in a dry sink to defend against Cheyenne. The good guys and cheyenne run out of ammunition, but the "Dakota Incident" never runs out of clich√©s. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician defending the path of redskin. At the end of this 88 minute vacuum cleaner, you will feel that you have been caught in a gulch and threatened to kill Cheyenne herself.
