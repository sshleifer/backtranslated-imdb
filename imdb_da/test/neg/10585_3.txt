When a loser teen gets bitten by an insect, he becomes superhero Dragonfly ... Superhero Movie is the latest haunting movie to hit screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved in the Airplane !, the Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) still suffering from the error the latest spoofs have ... mostly it's more stupid than fun! The error is mainly in gags. It's simply not fun enough. Some of the jokes seem like a nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. For example, the X men fall due Or the entire speed sequence. Blazing Saddles This Is Not! One of the most important things about the best ghost movies, like Airplane, is that although the dialogue is extremely fun, the cast is mostly played quite straight. This makes it even more fun. Even when there is simple dialogue in the foreground, there may well be fun things happening behind the casting. Again fun. The other important thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang gags on. <br /> <br /> The latest trend seems to be taking scenes from various movies, so try and spoof them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films rarely exists. Another flaw that these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually fun in the original versions, and in most cases even more fun than the spoof scene! The throw tries to get into the spirit that is required, but with a lot of unfunny dialogue and scenes it is hard to get it worked out. <br /> <br /> As recent haunting films, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet the Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny film in the past, it is not nearly good enough.
