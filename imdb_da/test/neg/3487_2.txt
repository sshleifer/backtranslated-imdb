The bad news: The Canadian version of Beast In the Cellar published by Maple Pictures, which I saw, was of poor quality. Dark and washed out, it seemed to be doubly random from a VHS tape. It even jumps at some point because of some missing frames. <br /> <br /> The good news: This movie is so bad that the DVD's poor quality detracted from my enjoyment. This horror movie fails to build up tensions and lacks scares. It's a horrorless horror movie. While most scary movies have limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character repeats something we've just heard from two other characters. Probably all chit chat works as a filler for a very low budget, imaginative movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not campy enough to make it worth looking at.
