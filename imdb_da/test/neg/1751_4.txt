I have recently seen Shame, which is directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles, and that it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to better relate to the characters, the time period, and their stories. I didn't like how the movie was very slow at first and how you didn't know what was really going on. It was first and foremost a story about Eva and Jan's relationship. The film also ended on a very depressing note, because nothing good came out of all the conflicts and changed throughout the film. I would probably not see Shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.
