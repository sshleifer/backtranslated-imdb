STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans Murderer Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is awarded to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico to help police with their efforts to stop a great heroin smuggling in their city. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders), who uses a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to take him down, pulling the two men into an explosive final showdown, where only one will go alive. After death, Van Damme seemed to be at a high, showing that he could do the best directly on video in the action market. While it was a much more drama-oriented movie, The Shepherd has returned to kick kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has unfortunately produced his worst movie since Derailed. It's not that close to that movie, but what I said is still standing. <br /> <br /> A boring and predictable movie, with little in the way of any exciting action. How little is there consists of some easy-going fighting situations that look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo / sped-up effects for those who unfortunately make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the movie a kind of Robert Rodriguez / Desperado, but it only adds to the desperation. <br /> <br /> The CEO gives a particularly uninspired performance, and since he's never been a Robert De Niro kind of actor, it can't be good. As a villain, the Lord must not expect to leave the grave at any time soon. He gets a small dialogue at the beginning when he struggles to muster an American accent, but gets mysteriously better towards the end. All supports are just as boring, and do nothing to raise the spirits of the movie at all. <br /> <br /> This is a shepherd who strayed right from the pack. *
