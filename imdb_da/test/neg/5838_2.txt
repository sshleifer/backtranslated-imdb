This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi B movie is what you wanted if you took an early Fred Olen Ray movie and took fun. Or vice versa, it's like a Uwe Boll 'movie' but without so much openness. A young nubile chain-gang convict (C.C. Costigan) agrees to act as a room hall to stop wacky Kim Dawson's plans ... that everyone apparently has sex with everyone else (the evil enemy). Anyone who went into this movie looking for serious science fiction, you have what you deserved for not doing any homework on the movie at all. First of all, when Kim Dawson ever starred in anything other than soft-core Skinamax level crap. For that matter, take a look at the CV for Costigan and the director before taking a hissy fit, saying you expected something else. Don't make me wrong, because a space / action / soft-core / titillation flick is this movie still not good, but if you had expected something in line with "Contact", I have no pity. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz-on-demand (Available until December 8, 2005)
