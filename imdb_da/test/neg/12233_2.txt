One would think that since this movie has a bad rep that I would exaggerate when I say I hated this movie. But I'm serious, this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny and such a waste of time. I mean after the first 30 I had a big headache, and the smile I had on my face (it was mostly ready to laugh) was wearing. When this movie was over, I was so happy and because I had good expectations that it would be fun I was extremely disappointed. It's not good, the comedy moments are lame and unfunny. It's good that everything is good with it, because I laughed like maybe 2 parts. Overall, it's so boring, and I can't tell you how horrible this I think this could be used as a suicide technique. I think I don't think for some that it's just as attentive. So, my last words about this are, AVOID ALL COSTS.
