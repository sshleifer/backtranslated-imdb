This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is definitely the most boring. Wonder why it's shot mostly in the dark and mostly with Vincent Gallo to walk away from the camera or look down? Because he won't show his face to actually agree to be in this movie. I liked his early stuff, but the "Brown Bunny" pretentiousness then thrown into this drivel knocked him down a stick in my book. And Val Kilmer? I will actually send him a sympathy card. "The doors" to this ??? In fact, the casting was the only reason to watch this movie, and Val does not even show before the movie is more than halfway. Just a sad movie.
