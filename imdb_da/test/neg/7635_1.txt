This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a rather ridiculous end. I saw this movie hoping for the best and instead found something really bad. the movie star two actors that i like a lot, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Sure they had decent chemistry together, but what? The premise of the movie was bad at first, and the performance did the worst. Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who tries to analyze a doomed serial killer whose defense is linked to multiple personality disorders. It will pretty much give you a hint of where the movie goes and the identity of the murderers. Early in the film, she gets an unexpected visit from her father. This was made in the 1990s when the bad daddy was the one in Hollywood, another clue about the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who enters Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first meeting between Tony and Sarah is so poorly done and so convincing it makes you wonder how it was even shot. And there is an order in which the two must know each other so juicy that it doesn't seem to belong here. One thing I would admit was that there was a sex scene that is very hot. Anyway scary things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arrive, things fall away from the wall that can kill Sarah, an incident that says things are not normal anymore. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was badly conceived, editing at times seemed to jump, and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the entire orchestral music that played in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the end was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that order. It is sad that she never got first-class materials in her career. She is the rare combination of talent and beauty.
