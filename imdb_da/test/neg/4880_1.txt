I got this movie in a trading box and hoped for an entertaining bad flick. Boy was I disappointed. (except avon.) You see, the movie is actually awful, but so awful, it's not even ridiculous. The reason, oh wait, there's no plot. I suppose you could say it's about the protagonist who rises up the ranks of the street battle. At the end of the film, the directors decided to either do nothing more or more likely died and had a monkey finish that controlled the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT IT! Although the end doesn't really ruin anything. The protagonist ends up in a room full of mirrors, one enters Enter The Dragon, and then becomes really sour, has stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor in this movie was Avon's scene. He speaks to the rival street chief and says something in this direction: "Don't worry about him more sir. I've killed him in a sophisticated way. I won him, I ate him, we went to a disco. We were havin a lot of fun, and then I killed him. "At what point the boss says" good work avon. You're number one. " And avon says "Number 1! Always!" Alriiight! "The scene continues to say" alllrriiiight! "Over and over again. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I don't think. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own" Homeboy " The version of this movie, which means the title of the box I own, is "Homeboy." It shows a big guy with a huge gun and screaming. This never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this review, but hell yes, I'll keep it up.
