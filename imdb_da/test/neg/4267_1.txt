I find the criticism of many IMDb users a bit harsh and find in many cases that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not that of the guy in the street who wants to sit and see something, just to come away from it all. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I have to say that it was BAD. I'm a sci-fi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for another second. There was no proper story. I can be an idiot, but I still don't know where the government was so worried about these pieces. <br /> <br /> The pathetic attempt by the protagonist to put together these 3 pieces is frightening. Half of the time, the two pieces were already in place, and he simply had to add the third. A 3 year old boy would have been able to put them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
