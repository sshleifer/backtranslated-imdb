I hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events taking place in the 'Shuttle' happen to you or close, and you find a gun, YOU BACK YOUR BACK. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever the pulse stops on them and increases on you. I think God would say, "Good call." In a very 'Hostel' type movie, but more realistic ?? since it could really happen to anyone, yes, if you are a beautiful young woman, is it? 'Shuttle' was a decent movie, but on the long side. A couple of good shocks (always call AAA even to change a tire), basically just a surprise, but mostly you could see things coming. And apart from the typical "tie him up" instead of the previously mentioned shoot, he was the most annoying part of the revelation against the closure from one best friend to another. Get past them, it's fun for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, it's original), and they lost their luggage and prevented them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious pre-language sign language scene, they launch a "for-good-to-be-true" half-price shuttle ride. Clich√©d Jocks, who was previously introduced, entered the shooter, joining what seems to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed'. From here it is obvious what is happening (I told it was a 'Hostel' knock) but still I didn't find too horrible, but nothing spectacular. Although it would have served the audience better by about 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have nearly 2 hours to kill and are in horror.
