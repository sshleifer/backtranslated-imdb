This has one of the most pathetic, predictable and ill-acted movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I have never seen anyone less convincing on the screen. I laughed him all the way through. Then there is this romance between him and the beautiful Rene Russo, who was even more pathetic than the one between Mr.Connery and MsZeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> The IMDb user asked the question: What do you dislike about this movie? I ask: What do I like about it? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best movie chore ever (he has saved Con Air yourself). But it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is called the fire, but the 'Bodyguard 2: rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. Just watch if you are a dead hard John Malkovich fan. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
