I am no director or author or anything related to a movie. But watching more than 1 movie every day has given me the idea of ​​what is a good movie or not. So here it is: The fast and the undead are a rip-off of Quick and the Dead. I thought it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it. But oh no, I was really in favor of a very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> To put it simply sucks the movie. I'm a big fan of gore movies, but this one just gives you a go here and there, but they're not that consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them credit to create cruel signs that have given me a bit of a bother. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of zombies, see this. If you are not ... better look for other robot movies.
