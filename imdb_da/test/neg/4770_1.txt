My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people have been made HUNDREDS OF TIMES. It has been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It has been used in lots of low budget 50 movies, on a par with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And it brings it to a completely different level of cheese with plants that speak. I have known no one who went out, but I know many people who completely broke out in a hysterical laugh during parts of this movie. I was one of them. Doesn't the horror genre fear anything a little better than this pile of ridiculous bushes? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily have been copied / deployed from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or another movie with collage kids accidentally. Still, it's called "characterizing" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters have had before? Would you never want a movie to have characters that were not just forgettable pieces of meat with bones? <br /> <br /> 3. This was not gory. A guy cuts his skin away. Oh my! (Not.) A guy gets his legs broken. Oh my! Gasp! (Not.) I've shown movies like this on my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies worse than that! Why was it rated R? " So why was it rated R? <br /> <br /> 4. Here's the only plot movie / book to have: collage kids drinking, having sex, getting naked, cruse, bleeding and eventually dying. This is perhaps the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie, but people call this "mature"? What . . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I don't think I've ever seen any less original sense, I saw a beautiful mind. <br /> <br /> Have you ever sat there and wanted the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, to do something. . . good, different? Something really original? <br /> <br /> I just wanted more horror movies to have actual horror, not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of false blood thrown around. <br /> <br /> 1/10
