Being a science fiction fan from my early childhood (long time ago) I always hated incredible plots. It is a pity that most writers of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I've always lost them thinking, "kids are stupid to realize, so we don't have to strive". The author of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is set up by his new friends to spy on his parents because they believe the parents are foreigners. So exciting the thought sounded to me, so much I was saddened by its recognition. I thought the filmmakers had this very one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by tapping it into a dark, stylish and meticulously slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do they manage to get out of this rude nonsense"? And then - bang - they didn't even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, then visit "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
