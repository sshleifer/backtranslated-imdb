Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up just after Conan O'Brien and Late Nights fans are suddenly no doubt watching Carson's show. Carson Daly can't hold a candle to Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late night talk show host, and Last Call seems to miss more than hit this hit and miss the genre. The views are only redeeming quality, so short. But I wouldn't call it shit. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his show is not amazing (it is really useful here), while some of Last Call's sketches and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. In fact, some of Carson's montages have become quite entertaining, and the sketches occasionally have their moments of decent comedy. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson is okay, even with only one guest, not even late night material, but still above the level achieved by a high school AV team. But he doesn't have the quick humor that makes Conan so much fun. I don't like his musical guests, but it's more because I'm not a fan of that kind of music, so I don't mind him. <br /> <br /> On the house band. I don't know Joe Firstman's band and wouldn't compare them to CBS Orchestra, Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and Cleetones are better. But, Firstman's bandmates still make the show in my opinion. Especially the Altsax player, who sometimes appears (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and always plays in the top register), if he sees anything, he must look at the show. <br /> In summary, this show is not even worth a full bag of kibble n 'bits. But it has an audience and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". If you don't have a cable and stand up at 1:37, there really isn't much more to choose from and the surprise surprise is worse out there in that time frame. So if you wait for Poker After Dark to move on, 30 minutes of last call won't kill you during the wait.
