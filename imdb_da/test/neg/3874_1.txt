This film had potential. The script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with suicide topics, patricide, regret and - as Chris says - "10 years of going nowhere". It is a stark contrast to the original MAG7, which was light, humorous, and even the bad guy was lovable. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting tone change, and if they had developed the characters more, I might have seen it well. <br /> <br /> Instead, they waste too much time on free (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. At some point you see a horse fall, and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But not many people will notice it, since there are already 2 dozen horse trips (I do not exaggerate) and then we are already off. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the title of my review. This movie was largely cut because of animal abuse so chances are (if you decide to see it) you get the dimmed, kiddie version. There is a bullfight where the matador sticks the bull, and suddenly when the crowd breaks up, there is no bull, just the matador in an empty arena. As wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I'm not. More likely, the scene was cut. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a cockfight scene where one of the birds in the original version becomes horrified before a host of happy Mexicans. This was cut. But we still see enough to be quite annoyed. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are the horse throws. One after the other you see that the horse legs are greased and send thousands of pounds of horse upside down. In a scene, a horse is thrown, and then rinsing it on the ground under paralytic cramps, an explosive goes right under the neck. <br /> <br /> This movie was made in 1966 when Hollywood just started regulating animal brutality on film. This is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen. So, if that kind of thing floats in your boat, check it out and you get a mild tension. But if not, you will either be annoyed or flat out bored.
