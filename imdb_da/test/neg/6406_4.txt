There was a time when Joel Schumacher was placed quite high on my list of favorite directors. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, when his name was linked to several great films such as "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down," he was really one of Hollywood's most gifted instructors. Then came the stupid "Batman" followers, unfortunately and then it seemed that every potentially sublime manuscript became a gigantic mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better movies and even the incredibly immaculate concept "Number 23" should have been treated to a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. Literally from the beginning to the end, "Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and spooky thriller and therefore uses all the terrible clich√©s of the major cinema history, including heavy narratives, flashbacks, disorderly structure, multi-person characters, many plot phrases that grow increasingly absurd and eerie asylum positions. However, nothing simply helps because of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired commitment of cast & crew. As much as you try to connect with the protagonist and be outspoken about the crazy theories, it is still a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a Rare, Non-Comic Role) is a boring animal lover whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on her birthday. The book tells of all kinds of devil's theories and strange coincidences associated with number 23. Walter quickly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (an insidious detective examining a grim random suicide) and begins to look at abundant examples of the 23 puzzles in his own private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia, and apparently this entire 23 numerology of nonsense really exists, and some people honestly believe that most disasters and accidents are directly linked to this vicious number. Well, that's just ?? crazy! But hi, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how demented they are, and I can only share my humble opinion on a movie based on an out-and-out compassionate riddle. "Number 23" is not exciting, despite several bleak and ugly make-up effects, and never manages to make you think about the role of the number in your own life. All cast members perform their normal capacity, but it was nevertheless a pleasure to see the lovely Ms Virginia Madsen in a relatively large production again. Absolutely not recommended if you are looking for a solid and spooky evening with exciting fun but durable and not entirely without profit.
