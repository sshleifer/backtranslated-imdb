Dark Harvest is about a group of friends who go on a farm (it belongs to one of their friend's relatives or something) for an escape. But there are killed scarecrows lurking there (there was also a curse in there, but I forgot what it was about). The act of this movie is horrible, I don't know what the director was thinking when he threw actors and actresses. Scripture is the same story as the play "horrible" (this statement comes up is very obvious, but ..) If there were better plays and a better script, this could have turned out "okay". <br /> <br /> The management also stunk, I see no potential in this guy's future. After all these negatives, this film still maintains a "fun" factor adjacent to one two. The last plus is that they don't use CGI! My overall thoughts about this movie are it's bad, really bad, but so bad is it "fun" so it becomes a 2/10
