I've heard people compare this movie to Sideways. How this comparison was made I will never guess because this movie could not be compared to Sideways in any way. These 2 films were as different as Star Wars and Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common at all was that they both had wine as a subject. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were destroyed by the worst camera work ever ... tried. I have never seen worse camera work in my life and I compare it to home videos by accident by 5-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I only give these two stars the interesting interviews with French wine types and to show how intrusive and corrupt the American wine companies are (Are not all companies tedious and corrupt?) I would give it -10 stars (yes, it's NEGATIVE 10) for the regrettable, horrible, horrible, horrible, VERTIGO-INDUCING, 5-year-able-better-better camera mess.
