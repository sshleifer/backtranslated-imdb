I love Brian Yuzna's other work, even raw materials like 'Necronomicon', but 'Offspring' was too much, even for me. My main complaint is that it is unnecessary to exploit Jillian McWhirter's nudity; * insinuation of sexual violence. The scene where she tries a coat hangs abortion after several minutes of naked screams, is an excellent example. Arnold Vosloos 'performance' is completely treacherous, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not store this festering high of a movie. Foreigners are boring, the uniform boring lighting weakens your interest and the plot is quite predictable. The only highlights for me were a too short glimpse of the alien's true form (very nice model), and the scene where Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was also ok. But you have been warned.
