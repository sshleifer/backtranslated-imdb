There must have been a lot of background information left out of the movie. In fact, in the movie, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even feel depressed. She just seemed like a girl who went out of control when she finally came to college, mainly from making drugs and drinking alcohol. It seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Well, she had emotional problems because her father left, and she hardly saw him as a child, and her mother seemed a little out there. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just drug, and I don't think because of depression. She was very much needed as Rafe ran away, but she was so because of her father. <br /> <br /> But I think this movie has never achieved a theater release, it is not enough with the plot and the story is not well written. FINALLY VALUE: Truly I would only recommend it if you are interested in seeing Ricc's first nude scene. Otherwise it is not very interesting.
