"Menace" is not fun. It tries hard - too hard. But rarely brings a smile. There is no action, just mugging. One of the main characters carries a stupid grimacing on his face throughout the film. No doubt the less talented Wayan's brothers stared, wrote and produced the movie, they were totally blind to their lack of talent. Menace consists of a series of unfunny, a joke sketch. The punch line can be seen a kilometer away, but you have to wait until everything unfolds. No zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. Only one scene after the second building for the joke. The witnesses themselves are young. Loc Dog (the one with the perma-grimace) speaks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath, and then she chooses her nose and then wait for it (remember that you must always be w-a-i-t) she goes fast! How fun is that? Ten-year-old boys can find fun because they haven't heard the jokes so many times before. Alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or rocky then you will be able to follow along and maybe even find it entertaining. The challenge is filled enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out.
