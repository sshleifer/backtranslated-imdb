Like many people in my general age group, I remember watching this movie as a child in '98 and coming out of the theater almost in tears. At that time, it seemed to be one of our generation's most important, annoyingly inspiring movie experiences. At one nineteenth, action-packed, fun, heartbreaking and truly inspiring, Armegeddeon really had everything right down to the captivating Aerosmith theme song and sappy tears-ends of an end. <br /> <br /> Sweet Jebus. What did we smoke? I saw it for the first time this year last night on one of the movie channels, and ... I can't even describe it. This really is one of the worst movies ever made. Where to start? Abandonment of the abundance of CURRENT scientific errors ('personal trackers' on astronauts? Yes, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable - I even dare to say unsurpassed in which the combined crappy script with crappy acting. There are too many examples of this to start recording here, but one especially jumps in mind - the scene where Bruce Willis tells Feds exactly where to go to track each of his oh-so-charming-roguish members of his oil drilling team ('check every bar in New Orleans', 'Craps tables in Vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis' ... all to 'Come Together' ... it reminded me of a bit "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!" Scene from Anchorman, except for serious ones. Ben Affleck once again shows that he is by far the most overpaid Hollywood actor with less depth, reach and superior talent than anyone else in the company. Not that, Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or ALL OTHER IN THIS GOD DEMAND OF GARBAGE was much better. <br /> <br /> (I have to say I got a kick out to see a priesthood Owen Wilson being killed halfway through ... is this the only movie where his character dies?) Peter Stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical Russian cherry you've ever scored. (Peter Stormare again seems to have a talent for playing over-the-top Eurotypes.) It was really funny how almost almost immediately after the Americans dock with the Russian space station (which is actually called in the movie), Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causes the entire collection to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that, in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth to be destroyed and it seems absolutely no one to care about. And to top it all, it is literally on the spot for simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be American. There are lots of other things to think about, but I don't want ... enough to say that this is a really, really, really horrible movie that I am ashamed to have ever really wanted. <br /> <br /> I give it two stars just for the mockability factor.
