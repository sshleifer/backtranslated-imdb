Altioklar: The bitch's master. <br /> <br /> Watch some movies, steal some of them, write a script ... It must be very easy to be an instructor in Turkey. I think Altioklar saw "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", a couple of series about crime, murder, etc. Then he said "Eureka, eureka" (I have found it!) After he wrote the manuscript of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the start of the movie. It took only 10 minutes for me. He shouted, "I'm the killer, I'm the killer." There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated imitations, funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There's only one good thing in the movie. The performance of Demet Evgar is very good. You can watch the movie just for that.
