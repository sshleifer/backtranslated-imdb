This movie is an obvious rip-off by Underworld USA with Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a few hours and see the original. I found this to be uneven and difficult to follow with many scenes that didn't make much sense. I am not opposed to violence in film, but it all seemed like an excuse to blow away from person to person, many of which were only marginally related to history. When everyone else was killed, I asked the whole movie why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brains out. He could probably have, and Johnny was sure it wasn't like anyone who could trust. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; Why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should we think so? Surely they didn't think they had shot at a PG rating. Nothing in this movie seemed to play naturally. as if you were looking at people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy and shallow way.
