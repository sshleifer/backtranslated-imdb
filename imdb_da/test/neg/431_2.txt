This is a title that searches for a movie. It is a pitch that sounded lucrative to some study leader and the rest is cursed. When this film was made, there were still two things CGI didn't do at all: people and fur. Thus, frantic people were not destined to look good when reproduced by the computer. This is the only example I can think of where the effects on a well-financed successor took a big leap back landing well behind the original movie. For the record, the design of the wolves does not help a bit. The film authorities apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped, attempted to do both, and settled with a creature that looked just as unlucky. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short twisted resembles a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass section. This is a movie that exists PURELY to deposit on its previous one. I'm not a fan of Landis's original movie, but boy, it looks good in light of this. If you thought some of Landi's humor was forced, try some of the monstrous attempts here. The bubble gum scene, the body of humor, the dog there ... you know, you just have to see it a little bit yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from performing the "ugly American" and bungee jumping from the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night. It causes him to save a young woman (Delpy - Julie it is not worth just being a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) to jump to her death. She turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who plan to ... I'm not sure of anything bad. stereotypes, gaping plot holes, a muddled ending. Regardless, the studio was worried that the title would probably trick millions of "American werewolfs into London" fans to hand over their money. For the most part, it was happy to say they were wrong.
