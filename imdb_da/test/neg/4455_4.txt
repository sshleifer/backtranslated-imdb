It is a shame that such a lame plot should hang in such picturesque places, with some documentary style reports pushed in for extra length. A shorter movie may have kept the tension a little more, and a more charismatic lead must not have lacked its lines so much. The female leader was also allowed to do enough, resulting in a beautiful but boring affair. It builds towards the end, but the main player's own redemption is too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. Not terrible, just a shame. Unexciting but nice enough to reach the TV plans of the early hours.
