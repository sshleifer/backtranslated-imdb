It's so depressing when filmmakers try to be cool, and it's so obvious here. This has below average plays, ridiculous dialogue, split screens that are difficult to see, and many goofs in the attempt to be a period movie and autobiographical. This movie should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to go see this movie. I wish I had listened.
