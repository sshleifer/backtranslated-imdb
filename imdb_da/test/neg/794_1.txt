THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of the genius legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller "Button, Button" by the wanekind filmmaker Richard Kelly, who really stretches a small, well-crafted piece in a pram 'WTF' a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously lean!) Man Langella makes a million-dollar offer to fight for couples Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla mixes with the hilt!): A box with a red button that when pushed will kill some strangers in the world (!) Safe strings are attached, but does it really matter here? What does that mean, why in the name of God, Kelly makes trowel on so much inequality (ie, nasal bleeding, aqueous transport systems that is really Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension is to be stretched as tightly as possible (oh options). If it sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're half-tall (the '80s TV restart actually made a decent little screen fit, actually clean it instead!) One of the year's worst movies.
