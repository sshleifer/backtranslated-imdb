Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a ripoff of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the blonde bombshell older daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart), married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart) the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And of course there is the greatest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough girlfriend style mother without giving her the same lovable qualities that Roseanne had. Or maybe they also made her * gracious, because Reba Hart seems to wake up between being mediocre and scary (therefore Van's line to his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And be sweet and caring with little transition between. Roseanne at least managed to get it against her being cruel for being kind, as she was always mediocre and sarcastic, and when she tried to open it, it was hard for her. As inconsistent as Reba's character, it's hard for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even though the characters were not completely ripped off by "Roseanne", nothing could have saved the show from being sub-paired in the plot area. The authors try to give the show substance, but they really can't leave the corny jokes far enough to give any influence. And you'd better believe that the jokes are corny; It's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks a joke is fun. While they occasionally come up with something that is fun (I don't pretend not to laugh at a few episodes), these gems are too few and far apart to make "Reba" witty. Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "Roseanne", sub-par plots and sub-par couples humor, and (let's see it) horribly acting. The view may be a little better, in fact, if they replace all the actors, especially Reba himself, who is more community-theater quality than top class sitcom quality. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it.
