A bad movie, but with a wheel worth enjoying. For most of the movie, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. Fields are bad. Then there's a sequence of Bob Hope and his movie ex; The dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "Thanks for the Memories") bright, cynical and lovely. Who fell into this bit? Still, it makes all the original 25 cents worth worth.
