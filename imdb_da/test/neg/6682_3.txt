This was a first move for Clinton, I was there while he shot this mess back in Adelaide about 98 ... Although I was not directly involved in the production, I witnessed the typical misleading behavior, post-set that went down : the parties, the substances, the illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a movie, but also a by-product of young, talented people caught in classical ideologies of fame and worldly position. <br /> <br /> I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script ... that was the trouble, and I'm sure a much better job will be done if there is next time around! Quite frankly, he has certainly not made any favors with this on his CV, nor did he throw ... but hey, it was a paying job in a country where the actors regularly starve to death <br /> <br /> In summary, fascinating that see the 'production of' basically not so fun to experience (ak!).
