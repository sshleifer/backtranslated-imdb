The action was horrible. The special effects dominated the film. The scripture was pathetic, and the dialogue was incredible. And the stupid little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst crime of "Armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Is, it's 800 miles wide! No one in NASA even sees the asteroid until a dinner meteor shower wakes up in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drill team to join the astronauts and train them for a week? Yeah right. Someone brings a sidearm on the space shuttle with them? Yes, it is realistic. And Bruce Willis blows the asteroid with three seconds to save. How Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I rowed for the asteroid!
