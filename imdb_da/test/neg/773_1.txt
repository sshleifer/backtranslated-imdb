Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented leader of a Freakshow. Each performance is flat and insensitive, except Fondacaros. The reason is simple and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high school children go to the carnival, see a side event and come across their heads. <br /> <br /> Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, it's not like any of his other movies. This is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) Other F.O. Ray film excels. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also contained a documentation where the director makes comments like "We had a limited budget" and "with our limited timeline" that speaks of how much Charles Band cared about this movie. Hire the "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of himself (and that says a lot after seeing "Killer Eye") Degree: D-
