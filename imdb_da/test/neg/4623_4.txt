Wow! That James Purefoy looks like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the most profound thought I took with me after seeing the slightly underpowering George and The Dragon. For a fantasy comedy, the story was very boring and the effects were inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The problem was not the play. James Purefoy makes a good knight and his various side kicks are not bad signs. I even thought Patrick Swayze in this role was also a good idea. Flat-Chested Piper Perabo also had some good opportunities. I even liked the baby. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens and * the way * it happens was just "eh". Not interesting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, who was actually funny, this movie comes up short. I'm sorry about the decent actors who were in this frantic trudgery. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
