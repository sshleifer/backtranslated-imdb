A lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this movie, but it only made me feel misanthropic. If the alley "intellectual" handling of their annoying sex life sounds ok to you, see it. I felt bored, but glad I knew people like that. The premise of the film was that, as with all societies or large civilizations, they are ultimately doomed to failure. According to the female historians character who drills us with this fact, America shows signs that it is declining (she advocates being more detailed than me). The next part of the film is worried about her friends and colleagues' vacuum, feverish and asinine behavior and the various miseries caused by their libido-like behavior with a vague attempt at humor. Many people liked this movie where I saw it. I couldn't relate to that.
