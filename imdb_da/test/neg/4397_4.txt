This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very poor sitcom. How many vagabelled humorous misconceptions can you grab just a movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are changed, conversations are erroneous, people are mixed up, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people have to laugh at something. The authors really struggle to keep everything going, which makes the dialogue feel really forced. If anyone in this movie acted like a real person, all of this would be resolved in about two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives, but they should keep the misunderstandings going. At times, this movie also tries to go to some young laughs, but all they do is remember how funny "American Pie" was. The scene with the nerd tells the hooker (whom he believes is a foreign student) to "eat his sausage" continue forever, not a second of it is fun. I have to give this movie some credit: Because of the subplot of stolen money, it's not as boring as it could have been. It also has a laugh here and there, but unfortunately it goes back to another sign of misunderstanding. Overall, this movie is just too bad.
