There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: terrible. How "Mostly Martha" was remade is horrible. The title of the movie is horrible. The actors are horrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking with the US is terrible. If you have seen "Bella Martha", the same is the original title, and that means "Beautiful Martha", this is a blow in the stomach. Ms. Jones' play is so bad and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp), would have done better. Not to mention the chef, who would better play a different role. And the little girl ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, an authentic ... why was it recreated? There was a story .... here they took it out. There is no story ... What should it represent? In a way, this movie was also perfect. Do you know when all ingredients fit together? This is the case here. A perfect crap ....
