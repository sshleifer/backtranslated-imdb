This adorable dog (called different names under the film) is apparently loved by the whole city ... but he is alone. He's friends with two kids (Cindy and Paul played amazingly bad), but their father won't let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - another cute dog. They (immediately) fall in love, and this leads to a hysterical assembly of the two who slip in the grass, drink from a fountain ... in slow motion no less! Also Benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two children are kidnapped by the most eerie, most eerie kidnappers I've ever seen, and - you don't know - they are hiding in the exact house Benji lives in! <br /> <br /> WOW was this bad! A big hit (for some reason) in 1974, which led to many successors (which I will NOT see). The movie is just terribly acted on "humor", so unfunny and poorly done that you just stare at the television in amazement. The movie also has a song that plays NONSTOP during the movie - so much so that you will scream. It was inexplicably nominated for best song on the Oscar - it won't win. Yes - the dogs are cute and much better than the human actors - but I need more than cute dogs to keep me interested. <br /> <br /> You might think I'm a little hard on a children's movie but I saw it with my 5 year old nephew. Within 20 minutes he was sad and stupid and stopped seeing. I continued to look in the hope that it would be better - it didn't. Really miserable - but very patient children or dog lovers like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: It's G-rated, but a dog is maliciously kicked a couple of times. You can't see it - you just hear it and the dog survives, but it can bother real young children.
