Most movies I can sit through easily, even though I don't like the movie. I'm the kind of person who recognizes big movies, even though I don't like the genre. This is the first movie I couldn't stand to see. Cat in the hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen many movies. The action is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he's really annoying). The silly songs that the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The reason draws again and again, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The comments of the "witty" parents are disgusting, not fun (I remember some awful comments about a garden that is being compared to, yes, a kind of person calling a "ho"). Although the film is very short, it seemed to last forever. Do not waste your time. I know little children who hated this movie. If children can't do it, I don't know how any adult can. I would like to steam more about this movie, but I don't even feel like wasting more time writing this review about it. I hated it! So together, don't spend 90 minutes of your life and see it here! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest rating I've ever made a movie.
