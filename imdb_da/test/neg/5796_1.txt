Unfortunately, this movie had the potential of such a willing cast, but everything was so badly thought and badly executed. I don't think I've ever seen any movies where every scene just falls flat with a loud spout as it did here. I also don't think I've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't give at least a laugh, but this vortex of pain gave nothing but groans and misery. The last time I was here stunned by how eerie a comedy might be, was with the horrible "Big Mommas House". Scene after scene, these movies will make your brain jelly. Stupid and stupid can sometimes be fun, but here are stupid and stupid used as a torture device against the viewer. An absolute, rock-bottom dud.
