This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen a lot). Personally, I liked the piercing taking on everything that was original, but except that it was pretty unmatched. I couldn't stand Dee Snider as an actor or as a singer. I thought he was trying everything he said to make it a memorable offer that they were not. I can get movies for free and I still didn't think it was worth the time to get.
