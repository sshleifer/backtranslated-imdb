Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around in naked, which is not a bad thing in itself, but when her character talks about all the guys she serves and to see her with Michael Madsen and a Asian guy in Current movie time made me feel like I needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie as if a disease were to rub me or something. <br /> <br /> The movie felt it was going for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? Plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The plot was great, the plot not so great. The director must at least choose a genre and exercise, practice, practice before attempting to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it of course.
