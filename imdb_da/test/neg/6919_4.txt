Start with the premise that you will do something to replace your lost love with a look-like. Throw away your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (these are not the things Leo G. Carroll contracted from the spider's poison in "Tarantula"). Throw in the fact that the protagonist, instead of finding a way to attract the young woman, goes into heavy hands until he fully draws attention to himself and closes this crazy plot: If he can make the girl get sick, then help him regain, she will marry him. The problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half a brain would have seen through things. There is a third party, a woman who the doctor played by J. Carroll Naish has treated with great insensitivity. You know she's going to be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a cage that is occasionally used in the sky, knows what it is. Oh good. There is so little meaning to this, who things it plays out for themselves and people get their only desserts.
