I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie made it impossible. While many claim superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this film was a lesson in abundance. As in the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera worked, but instead everything we got was awkward silence and very slow motion. The play was terribly horrible at poor student movie levels, while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they coaxed to be boring and boring? Either therory wouldn't surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather unclear makeup involved with the creatures from the other side. Either way, they all stuck together. Don't watch this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're a weakness).
