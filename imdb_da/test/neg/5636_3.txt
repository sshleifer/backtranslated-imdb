I didn't know anything about this DVD when I rented it. Had a quick look at the comments, but decided to keep an open mind. Of course, an independent film and low budget, but it didn't bother me. I want to see something with Derick Jacobi and as always he played his role well. What a shame nobody else did. I had seen 'Reconciliation' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In this she just seemed to turn up to read the lines. In my opinion, the biggest mistake was casting Vinnie Jones. To be honest I saw his picture on the DVD cover, but did not notice that he got top billing. A sticker was strategically placed over his name! It was visible, and I liked Dickens history along with today's day. Perhaps with a more accomplished actor leading the lead, this may have worked better. Yet it was weak.
