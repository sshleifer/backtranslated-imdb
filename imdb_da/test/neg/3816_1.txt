Saying this movie is worse than suffocating on your own diarrhea is a generous understatement. The only thing that is more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of movie waste is that the shmuck is paid by the manufacturers to record a lot of accounts to write a false rating. <br/> <br /> If you see a badly acted, suspicious, Snoozer by a movie about Sloth from Goonies, people are killing in a way that completely ignores all physical laws (pulling on an uncontrolled person's leg that causes them to being torn from the torso) is your idea of ​​a good movie, so knock yourself out. <br /> <br /> No carbon-based life form with a working occipital lobe would consider in a million eons that this movie is scary or entertaining.
