I watched the first 30 - 40 minutes of this movie on TV the second night and can agree that this is by far the worst of the series. None of it is fun, even Randy Quaid can't save this mess. Eric Idle was not fun in N.L. Euro. Vacation, and he's even worse here. The only fun scene is where they are at the airport and a guy is dressed as a Christmas walk by the camera shouting "Has anyone lost this?" as he holds a prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star out of ****
