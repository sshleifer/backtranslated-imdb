Charles Bronson has given viewers many good moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are a few action scenes in the movie, but they are really crappy. And when the action scenarios fail, does the story store the movie? At all, my answer to that is. The story is even worse than action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with a bug like this. A low budget, maybe? Regardless, it seemed that all actors had no interest in being in the movie at all. When that happens, the result is really bad.
