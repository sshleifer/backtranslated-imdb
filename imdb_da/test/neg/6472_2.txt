This remake has the title "That Darn Cat", but the D.C., the cat is more of a sideline than the main character. Patti Randall was not at all fond of this remake. She reminded me of one of the high schools in Goth, you read about who has been angry since the day they were born, so they end up opening fire at the rest of the school one day. The federal policeman, Kelso, was okay, but not as good as the original one. I think Disney was trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever he has) for stars, but they do not hold a light to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am a wildlife and a cat lover and I do not blame D.C. that remake is so much worse than the original movie. After all, they almost cut him out of the whole movie. All in all, a very poor remake.
