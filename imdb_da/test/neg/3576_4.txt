In New York, in the morning close to Christmas, an upper-class father and mother in their BMW go to a private school to watch their daughter's play. Then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in Manhattan. At night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they prepare drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve while buying Christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a large sum to pay the desired ransom. "R Xmas" is a misleading movie by Abel Ferrara. The main characters have no names, are anonymous, and perhaps his intention is to tell that in a neighbor's breast, the family in your building may have drug traffickers; or that drug dealers can also have families and can be loving people; or that there are many dirty police, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a simple excuse for crime? No matter what! But this humanization of criminals is a terrible message, and I really didn't like this movie. For example, in Brazil many drug traffickers and criminals help their communities because the state is not in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them citizens. In this movie we see a loving overclass family of the day delivering drugs as a lifestyle, but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in history, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any sign. Eventually I wanted all of them dead. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Ghosts Gangs")
