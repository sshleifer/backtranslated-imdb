Possible Spoiler alarm, although there is not much to spoil this movie. I saw Project A part II without seeing the first movie. I don't think I missed much. Project Part 2 is not just the worst Jackie Chan movie I've seen to date (yes worse than Fantasy Mission Force). This movie is one of the most unmatched movies the world has ever seen. It's just up there with the `Plan 9 From Outer Space 'on the sleeping inducing scale. The plot is twisted and crushed like a 50 foot ball of yarn, the cat has played with and eventually left to death. "Humor", if you could call it, seems to be written by an annoying high school freshman, who, despite how many people tell him he is not fun, is determined to get his lame humor out, regardless how painful a movie is made. And this movie is painfully bad. The reason involves Jackie Chan as a naval officer recruited by the police force to round off "all known criminals". He rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie, and I asked for a quick conclusion that I didn't get. Why the movie disturbs progress from this point, I have no idea. The film draws on and without and for no purpose, no plot and attempt at humor that fails so miserably, they make Carrot Top look like a comic genius. Kung Fu in this movie is lame and forgettable. There is better Kung Fu in that movie about the 3 Ninja children. Project Part II is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, but it is a complete waste of Jackie Han's and Maggie Cheung's talents that have made movie worlds superior to this. When Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes a certain death, I go into the `Blair Witch 'mode and ask (and want)' Should he die now so that the movie can end? `. An example of how ridiculous this movie is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A gang of pirates (who see nothing like pirates) throwing axes at Jackie. Does Jackie grab one of the other axes and break the chain on the handcuffs? None! You see it would ruin the "hilarious" gag of him being the handcuff of another person. If you have a friend laughing at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her and see, even if they don't get a chuckle out of this movie. If you are an uncomfortable person, this movie will probably put you in bed. Do not use heavy machinery while viewing Plan A Part II. Possible side effects include headache, retinal strain and death with boredom. 0/9 Stars
