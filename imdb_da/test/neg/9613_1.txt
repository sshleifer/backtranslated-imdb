The greetings of most critics, when they first expressed, have 'Frenzy' recently made the rounds of UK TV. I remember seeing it on its original release and then thought that if Hitchcock wanted to pair some kind of screen saver about his intricate misogynism, he could not have found a nestier little vehicle to do so. <br /> <br /> But Time is changing perspective, and so what was nauseating badly in 1972 can all be worthy of upward reassessment these years. <br /> <br /> Maybe. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is dross. Drossen from an aging director who would desperately exploit the artistic freedom of the 70s film production without appearing to realize that freedom imposes its own obligations - especially the need to bring integrity to one's work. <br /> <br /> There's no one here. And not much evidence of the former directional brilliance, either - the spine switch is implicitly abhorrent, neither shocking nor a tallest stylist stylish: it is just banal (the prolonged murder scene is just that: long-lasting without pace without reason, without any other purpose than the cheapest of directors wants to appear as modern an artist such as the second acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> It goes from bad to worse, with dialogue that tolerates any human ancestry (not least in the ridiculous diversion of our dear wood inspector and his wife's cooking). Perhaps the scene that best summarizes 'Frenzy' (and staying as the most explicit accusation of Hitchcock's persona) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss the serial schemes and then agree that at least the women were good first to be raped. <br /> <br /> I remember my disgust at that scene back in '72, and it's still untouched because it wasn't Hitchcock that was clever or sardonic, or trying to do any universal point (big themes, big Truths were not Hitchcock's forte or personal preferences.) It was just Hitchcock that allowed a reflection of his own distorted mirror on his life to shine through the film's texture. Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's last major masterpiece is to betray a little if any understanding of what Hitchcock actually accomplished in the way of cinematic trickery, movie experience and dazzling cinematic championship. "Frenzy" is therefore now what it always was: a cheap, unpleasant and sham-like movie that did not serve any of the people involved or in memory of a filmmaker who really was in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest ever.
