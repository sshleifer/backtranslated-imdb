Necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy / drama that tried to hard at all levels to be a serious movie about college football. Many current and former superstars athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comic highlights. Apart from that, it's a very mediocre movie. They should just have stacked to make a straightforward comedy filled with no realism. Instead, the filmmakers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. When will anyone make a decent movie about college football that is fun and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless it is free at t.v.
