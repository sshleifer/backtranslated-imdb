OK, I saw this movie through the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I watched the movie, so I figured I'd comment on it. I just love once again how Joe is stuck with curvy roles while his brother and nephew just get Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was supposed to be good. It seemed like the director and the actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had a very cheesy effect, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention beautiful crummy recording skills. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes because it is very much what they mention what we think throughout the movie and I will explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work over things. But since Zach is in the upper lower class and Natalie is in the middle class, it just won't work. But on their way home, they and Zach's friends come into a car accident, and now the angel of death / Soultaker is after them to meet with his quota. But it also seems that he has had some kind of other life relationship with Natalie, and that just can't seem to move on. So now, Natalie and Zach have to fight against the ever evoked five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives. I think Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a staircase to heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith had anything wrong, too. Basically, there are many plot holes in these movies that no one can see the characters and they can't be killed, but somehow they can still press buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and was a little distracting from the story itself. Soultaker was just a miserable movie that was rushed and made you feel so bad for Joe, the underrated Sheen / Estovez brother. <br /> <br /> 2/10
