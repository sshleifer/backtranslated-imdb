Not for the first time I'm out of kilter with the majority view. Oz is a terrible, pretentious, voyeuristic series. The creators have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. Used as ultra-raw signals, the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy. This makes it possible for viewers, who are blamed for intellectual excuses to see soap operative nonsense spiced up with all that is bad about humans. When you see an episode, keep in mind that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly enveloped, convincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approved eyes, hundreds of infants in poorer parts of the world have died of poor food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is the exploding drama at worst. It appeals to the basic instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony. The dialogue is incredibly ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms taken with realities are stupid. Here is a nightclub that owns dandy, arriving at Oz in its flap fine, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in an eye that burns a stash of drugs no one has discovered. Here is a murderous wimp that blasts the universe's mercy and begs to be killed, but of course the brute he is approaching rejects and makes a little unlikely neck that cuts. <br /> <br /> The action is running at a pace that is fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to always think of what's happening next to the rubbish that has just been shown. Just calm down, treason, a murder, a sex scene will be together within a minute or two. Of course, Oz is of course pretentious. You don't have to be embarrassed to be carried along by its flow. You can see it and tell yourself that the producers, the authors and the actors do everything with a big eye (or the same word but for a vocal change) to the audience. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be an uncomfortable viewer and excuse yourself for the wisdom, postmodernism, etc. skills of the Oz production team. They appeal to the lowest common denominator and pretend to operate on a higher level. <br /> <br /> Really a despicable series. And every hour it turns out to reward its decision makers and actors and generate advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than to see something as ugly and unnecessary, another couple of hundred children die if life could have been saved by the dollars spent by this terrible, successful, widely recognized series.
