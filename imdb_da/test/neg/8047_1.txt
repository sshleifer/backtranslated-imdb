... a movie comes together that manages to be terribly horrible from the opening titles through to the studio issue marked at the end of final credits. It was such a movie - the kind you can't stop seeing for fear of missing a moment with its ever-decreasing quality. Forget about the low budget indicated by a slow monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade without crowds, no traffic or place to see. Forget about the jumbled logic needed to remove the remote yourself so that the plot itself is plausible. Forget it, Roy Scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue while completely avoiding hiding his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly paced, bombarded by a score that is simply ridiculous and seems to be edited by a third degree. In general, scenarios twist to cover the hardest part by filming a presidential story on the cheap: make him act as president. I honestly sleep for a short time in the last wheel, and when I woke up I ran it back so as not to miss a single uncomfortable frame. Try this drinking game: take a shot every time you see it so you can see another much better movie. You will also turn off. <br /> <br /> Not since 'The Man' w / Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy have seen such a lovely unstoppable project. I can hand over copies as Christmas presents. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.
