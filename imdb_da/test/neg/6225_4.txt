Ruthless as one of the high action films. The whole cast seems to be on the move. I didn't really understand the director's intentions. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, thank you! This is a hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes are the unflattering photography - unflattering to the actors, but loving to the locations. The only thing that makes it all bearable is that Meryl Streep seems to be fooling on itself. No chemistry with his friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) is thinking of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman movie and you understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed especially by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. However, the audience seemed to enjoy it, so that's just me.
