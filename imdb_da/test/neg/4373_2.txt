Cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five black juvenile crimes across the lands and end up stranded in the bars when their van breaks down. After a deadly inlet with a racist, white waste pig with a shotgun (played by the director), they survive the survivors of a blind voodoo priestess. One teenager rarely uses a spell to call up Killjoy, who finally turns around midway through this bore in a subpar make-up job and bigger, smarter 'before it looks like it might slip off the head at all times. He then continues to kill the stupid characters as he spits some of the worst one-liners heard since Hee Haw was canceled. <br /> <br /> The action of "teenagers" is horrible, the dialogue even worse, the FX stink and it looks much cheaper than the first movie. Though I enjoyed him in his earlier Troma films, Trent Haaga (trying to imitate Jim Carrey here) is horrible and no fight for the hyperactive overemoting of Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (which at least had a few stupid laughs). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin of Full Moon Studios whose reputation as a fun direct-to-white franchise has completely disappeared since TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
