Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days, they managed to ignore them. While shamelessly copying them. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and gradually got tense, it just stinks. Radio DJ, "we must keep on air" effectively uses no time on the air. He sits at the bottom and watches the television for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the US or the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute, this mass of misfits still calls the zombies, "they infected" or those with "rabies". The word "Zombie" may be a guest appearance later, I could break less. Maybe there is a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? As the Bluetooth earphone is called "ear-stuff", I don't associate you! To finish, no plot + no action = no one cares. Waste of time, a shameless, poorly executed rip-off.
