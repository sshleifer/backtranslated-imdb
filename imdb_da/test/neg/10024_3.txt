Uhhh ... did they even have authors for this? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my movies. And as far as slasher film goes, it's just a crooked character development that's enough. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey doesn't give ?? And if you think I'm hyperbolic, just watch it yourself. Scene after scene, we just get actors standing around looking up abandoned and awkward, without any script. Without calling each other's names out when separated in the forest (natch), the only cases where these people say something substantive is that when a character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized by Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare, no?) and another rehashed an old campfire tale that didn't even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what is the plot?) At other times, The Prey actually has crazy to film his characters with boom mic just far enough we didn't quite can hear what they say. So we get whole scenes where the actors mumble! Intentionally! Seriously, I've seen more dialogue in a quiet movie. It is as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga during the feasts of the 80s slasher dille and you looked at the other and said: "Hi, I have a really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag. Somehow pad the whole feature around it. "And ... they did. <br /> <br /> To be fair, The Prey probably had some kind of writer on board. I think someone had to write down the stage scene and label the diaries. However, I am absolutely convinced that this film had no editor of any kind. There are clear pauses, dull tabloids, and zero pacing throughout. The filmmakers have nothing else in "script" for movies, so they fill in the maturity with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that are in the forest, where our wild and crazy teenagers are cut and cut. These critters are all filmed in straightforward, daily daylight in a completely reserved way and without attempts at atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science movie, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock footage. All that is missing is a tingling story from some National Geographic aged men. <br /> <br /> More exciting recordings graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene where two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese and another scene where a supportive character streaks away on a banjo for what feels like a hero minute and a half! One minute and a half! It is very banjoing to commit to celluloid at first, let alone insert into the final cut of the film! Way to go boys! Brevity and concision are the real victims of this butcher's party. The movie records quite a bit of steam (relatively) in the last 25 minutes, how much of the bloodbath condenses, and where a rip-off of Béla Bartók's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" cuts. Vaudeville Great Jackie Coogan makes a fun look like a tubby, bumbly park ranger (this was his last role if you can believe it). And there are some good gory moments, including a splattery neck tear and the above beheading. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" from the Addams Family movies) is also quite effective and makes him look like a weird hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus, if you love crazy, straight-to-left end, check how they pack this puppy up. You want to make a spit, I promise. <br /> <br /> I usually love movies that are at this level of infinity, but the first three quarters of The Prey are just as incredibly boring that they pretty much ruin the rest. Overall, this is a pretty rude and boring affair, and although it is not that bad, it should really only be seen by the weary slasher completists. Why do we do it for ourselves anyway?
