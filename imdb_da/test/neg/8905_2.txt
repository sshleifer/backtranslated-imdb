I watched TV guide last night and watched a movie starring Heather Grahm, which I liked in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started ok, but you could tell the story was missing, and in about halfway it began to get worse. I can't remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure it was, it wasn't there long. The plot was outdated and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I like movies like those that have been compared to like Fight Club, but this one doesn't come close !! Heather Grahm has done much better things since. I gave it a 2 out of 10 but it was because I clicked on the wrong number I meant to give it a 1.
