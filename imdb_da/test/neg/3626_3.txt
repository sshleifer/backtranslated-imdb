Okay people, I agree with almost everyone else's reviews here. The grades. Is. Stupid. They are ALL stereotypical and yet have fine clothing and are always thin. <br /> <br /> Didn't even get me on Jamie Lyn's role as ZOEY. Zoey is a beautiful, popular, tan, blonde young teen who just loves everyone! She has a "rebellious", great personality that everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme it is. Most annoying of all: her voice is so trembling and uncomfortable. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the first episode. The moment she enters the large PCA campus, everyone seems to love her. The boys want to ask her out, the girls will be her friend, etc. Thinking is all that the episode is playing with Zoey, who is always the center of attention; She is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident and has all pity her when she is weakly hit on the face. Oh yeah. <br /> <br /> My favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced to the show to hate Zoey. <br /> <br /> And Zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to his friends. In an episode, she even calls her friend a freak without NEVER apologizing and shows not least regret by doing so. <br /> <br /> Zoey is always the best: <br /> <br /> -Designing professional t-shirts and backpacks (which will be a big hit) <br /> <br /> come with very careful arrangements using a person to teach a single person a lesson. <br /> <br /> -Flagless qualities <br /> <br /> -It's blaming things that weren't even related to her so everyone else could be happy. <br /> <br /> - Coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on TV. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. She has no actress talent. She is always the perfect person. She seems snotty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! Can't stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone on the show always has good clothes. Even the nerve! Her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decent. No one cares that everyone at PCA loves you, Zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm. <br /> <br /> But regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and entertaining. The mood is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so flat that it's hard to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> This show would be great if Dan Schnieder put a little more time into thinking about the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical, so boring, that it is lame and stupid. Point: No one is at least overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, Zoey is the definition of Mary-Sue, History's lines are well thought out, and humor is ridiculous. But again, I would like to emphasize that the characters are bothering the show. See the show if you need to, but don't say I don't warn you if your eyes start to bleed.
