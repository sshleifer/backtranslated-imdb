hi .... i really don't know why this movie has been appreciated so much, maybe i missed it. The way I look at it, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that have dealt with "schizophrenia" and have informed, excited, shocked, evoked emotion and forced the audience to step apart their own reality and think ...... ... while it is true that the apes sen's endeavor was an ambitious one, in the face of all the other films this fall short ..... miserably ...... it was too slow, there was no detail about anything and the end .... was totally ... meaningless ...... it was not open ended or anything .... just meaningless ..... so watch it if you want to see a good concept, totally wasted. ......
