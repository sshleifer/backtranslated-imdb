I decided to watch this show and give it a ride, but I found it boring, and more importantly boring ..... Dull. <br /> <br /> There is too much sarcasm and the characters are all boring, there is too much to talk and the character Lorelai ... just keeps talking about and over and over ... Under another look felt like choking the characters, the bias doesn't seem, and all love and romance are just ruins what is already a crap show .... I can't believe this show survived past the pilot .... This seems to be a show that forces "Listen to your parent's line .... There is no current drama .... should have stayed a pilot ..... and a pilot alone ...
