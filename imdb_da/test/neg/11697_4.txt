No serious spoilers, but some much smaller. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the ever popular Asian scare wave, relates to a man and a wife who decide to come a little and decide to adopt a child The child who has a normal occupation with it dead tree in the family's garden eventually disappears when the couple eventually have their own child, and the above tree seems to be angry with the family itself. <br /> <br /> And it's about it. The movie moves in a snail frequency that looks in over 100 minutes with 80 minutes of material. It is essentially a thin family drama with a cruel tree, and there is very little in the way of scares, just shots of the tree with strange mumbling sounds that play over the top. The idea of ​​the tree is the mother of the child, but it is not fully exploited to its full potential. This kind of separates "Acacia" from much of the new wave it belongs to: Movies like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite and milk gentle ideas until they are red in the face. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to move toward the end; However, the realization of the fate of the child and the actions of the parents not only attenuate the past curiosity of history, but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it is difficult to take at all in one go. The final sequence is undoubtedly scary, but it feels too late. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie doesn't feel too much like a ring cash in, but with the "movie renaissance" that Korea is currently going through, I couldn't help but feel this movie could have been so much more.
