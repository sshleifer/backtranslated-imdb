I have seen the first two nights before I come to IMDb looking for some acting info. I saw the 9+ rating that surprised me when I wasn't so impressed with what I had seen. (For reference, I think Lonesome Dove was the best TV Western ever. I grew up next to the MGM back in Culver City in the 50s and have some sense of reverence about the Western genre.) <br /> So I saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling it was shot at the universal back (MGM is far away) and overall impression that it was not coming to get close to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming voice for those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0". <br /> <br /> This made me wonder about the process that gives a 9+ rating. If the people who give the 10s and 9s don't take the time to justify their vote, is the poll box filled with people with a monetary motivation? I have long used IMDb as a tool to screen movies and thought it best available. Now I'm not so sure.
