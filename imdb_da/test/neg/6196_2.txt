This film has a look at many "fresh" directors (close-ups and focus on the feelings experienced by the actors). The movie point was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast. The point is to "believe in Jesus Christ and the Morman Church" Oh, and if you read or hear anything contrary to the teachings of the prophets, it is just Hated. (Fuel for hate)
