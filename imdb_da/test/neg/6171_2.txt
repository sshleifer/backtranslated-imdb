I'm so disappointed in this movie, I can't express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke all the leather faced, and that the Third Rock From The Sun baby seemed like I was psycho. I thought wow, it's going to be a winner, freakin 'Natural Born Killers style. And it got better. The production value was great, the director was great, the play was great, the cinematography was great, and the plot was, well, the plot, yes what for something? Ca. halfway through this movie I pulled out the hair and shouted, "What the hell is going on?" And I literally mean that? Nothing makes any sense. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
