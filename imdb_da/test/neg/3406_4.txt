Let me preface by saying that I have lived in Louisville, Kentucky all my life. I grew up about half a mile from Waverly. In winter, we would pull our sledges down Maryman Road and cross the Dixie Highway to take a sledge on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the tunnel to warm us. The place was still run as a "Geriatric Center" at that time. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to look at what we thought was "Door to Morgue". I have to be honest. The only feeling we felt was that we got away with something we shouldn't do. I must say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. No stranger than teens boys act stupid ever happened. I love the fact that it becomes aware after all these years. One evening when I was young, we looked out on our porch and it turned out that the whole hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It burned for hours while the whole neighborhood was sitting outside watching. What is lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB there. Let's see it ?? The doctors then did everything they thought was right to save people. It took a lot of courage for people to work there and know how contagious TB was. Too much is focused on those who suffered. I've also entered the building several times in the early 70's. We wanted to go visit the shut-ins in nursing home through a church youth group. By the way, the doors were not imprisoned as steel doors with chains and padlocks as depicted in the film. They were wood and sometimes open too often. It smells urine and stools and you saw the occasional open dress associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80s. Much of it may have to do with the age of the building, or the real guy was not paid. After all, this is Kentucky. The part of the documentary that struck me most was to put bodies in a cart. If I am not mistaken, it seems to have been Holocaust footage. It was added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I'm a skeptic when it comes to "Ghosts". I think many people around here really think of the place to be haunted. Waverly for me, however, symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.
