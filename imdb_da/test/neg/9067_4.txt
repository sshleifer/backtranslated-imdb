Is there anything else on earth to be more appealing than learning what to expect our fragile bodies after, about, death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides a blow-by-blow response to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey into the world of preparatory tables, scalpel, surgical missions, human speech and combed mind. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I don't know which facets of the movie, except for its notorious reputation, may have helped it acquire enough high ratings. <br /> <br /> Storywise, it's pretty simple and straightforward - a day of life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coronary (or perhaps assistant pathologist or anyone he is) who is tired of his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional way, right in his workplace. I am confused as to which particular message the authors have attempted to provide with this one-note plot. I suppose it may somehow be inspired by Udo Kier's character's quirky behavior in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It is difficult to assess the practice of the actors who do not press a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind the medical masks. There is also not enough room for good camera work - basically the entire action has been unfolded mainly within four walls. Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive, and setup looks very plausible, but only a handful of physician / forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is performed here (if any). In fact, I used to think that the autopsy was done to examine the conditions of certain organs and to determine the cause of death. Now I know that dead bodies are separated, raped and humiliated, the intestines are torn apart, brains are retrieved from the head, filled in the stomach and mixed with the intestine, then the body is sewn back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor boys expected to write in their fraudulent autopsy reports subsequently? <br /> <br /> Shock and disgust factor - it is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would find his scare that the disc he intended to see with his wife and children next to a Christmas tree shows is a graphic video guide on vivisection. This unclear element is hardly available, sought after by people familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Therefore, it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this movie. They pay close attention to what they are content with and what they want to see. Cerdà is truly gifted and stylish instructor, evident from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" The Awakening ", stunning black and white card, and 30 minute 'Genesis', visually stunning and moody with an off-beat and interesting concept . And I'm pretty sure that someday he'll overcome the hearts of movie guests with his new, more mainstream-oriented material. And sooner or later, "immersion" will become a rarity for the careful collectors of his "early" warming. But in the meantime, I am afraid that it can be recommended strictly to doctors or specialists who are studying mental disorders and sexual abnormalities.
