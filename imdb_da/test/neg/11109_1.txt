This is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies I've seen for a while. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to make this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the tow roofs of the lost land and the creation of the black lagoon. In addition, they should have used someone who was a little smaller as playful Chupacabra is much smaller. All in all, however, the movie was so bad it was fun. Why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop Chupacabra, but the captain's kickboxing daughter does it okay? See if you are sick at home or feel down and need a good laugh.
