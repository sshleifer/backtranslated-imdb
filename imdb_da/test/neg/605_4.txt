"When a Killer Calls" is an exceptionally eerie slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision was clearly made to try money on the remake of "When a Stranger Calls" by basically putting in - almost word for word - the phone call sequences from that movie. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin to making the heroine's friends repulsive jerks. So at the start of the movie we really like and twist to the babysitter (a good credible job by Rebekah Kochan), but then along with standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined. <br /> <br /> The kind of works, but it's probably much more unpleasant than you'd expect, so be warned.
