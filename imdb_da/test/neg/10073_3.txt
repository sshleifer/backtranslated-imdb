How sad is it when a movie as nicely as "Jurassic Park" slowly nosedives in hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The latest successor, Jurassic Park III, has not thought of characters, history or just about any script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action that is not exciting or very interesting to see. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology. After 7 years of CGI progress, it only gives you more of the feeling that the movie was pumping out for the summer, relying on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl is not a good film making. <br /> <br /> See "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
