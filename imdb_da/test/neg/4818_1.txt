As native to New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this movie, from the terrible N'Awlin's dialect to the creative "manipulation" of Crescent City's geography, is horrible. This is another of the great Hollywood movies that decide to stereotype New Orleans as: 1. A city full of French-sounding idiots 2. A city full of people that sounds like they've just returned from Blanche Dubois cottage 3 A city of drunkards, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. A city of deep mystery where almost everyone practices or is the victim of voodoo (I admit that we may be a city of drunkards, although every day is not Mardi Gras) . "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I would not recommend it to anyone.
