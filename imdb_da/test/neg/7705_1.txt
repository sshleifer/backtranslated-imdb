This fake documentary is defective in many respects, it is poorly crafted, has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This movie uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and some of his work is based on real supernatural events he experienced. I am willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to Italy (only for suspension of disbelieve), but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists is total nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural. In his letters, he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there was evidence that humans were not so special. Another myth used in this movie is that Lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he was not, all his knowledge of the subject came from the most basic sources. So we end up with a movie about people jelling a lot at each other, and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love of horror. <br /> <br /> After watching movies Frankenstein Lovecraft said he was sad Mary Shelley because he felt her work was slaughtered. I'm sorry about Lovecraft.
