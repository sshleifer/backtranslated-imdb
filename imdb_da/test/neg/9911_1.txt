This movie is something terrible. I laughed all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mother thought it was not polite to laugh when people die, but in this movie death itself looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into a tornado. <br /> <br /> Explosions of cars thrown on buildings by wind forces resemble those of the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested in how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie. It's simply amazing how such a bad movie can make it to the TV. Only real reason to watch this movie is having some fun of nonsense and absurdity.
