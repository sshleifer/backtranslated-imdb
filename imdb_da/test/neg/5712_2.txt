This is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera that concentrates on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say because I defy you to see this randomly and tell me what the story was. What this is is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off his big body and for Mickey Rourke to smear a lot. That is it. Rourke's smugness is so bad that it's boring, and Bassinger, despite the big figure, looks cheap than beautiful. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the photographer for some beautiful closeup pictures and a wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's incapable of compensating. Let's face it: This movie was made for a single reason - titling male viewers. At this level, it probably succeeded. If I remember, that was why I looked at the fan of Bassinger's appearance, but I actually expected a story as well. They try to transfer it as "arty" and something deeper than soft porn only fools themselves.
