Maybe I saw a cleared version, but apart from a few flashes of breasts, I'm not sure what the top nudity these other commentators are referring to. All in all, not as bad as I expected from the previous comments, although the ending leaves you wondering ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you couldn't make the scenes, and I think it just added the horror and terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> Film quality could have been better, but the play was pretty decent. All in all, a decent scary (and yes brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.
