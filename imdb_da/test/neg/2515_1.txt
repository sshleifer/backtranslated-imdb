How dare you? Adam Low, without obvious shame, puts his name on this false tribute. It is not even a serious study or analysis or comment on the great Visconti work. Yes, it is long and wise, yes we have some wonderful clips from the movies that most interested in the subject have already seen. But what longs for the longest leaves the most enduring impression is gossip. The last and highest voice comes from a third movement German actor, ranting and raving. The appropriately named Mr.Low addressed this and hoped I could imagine getting better reviews than his earlier, more to the point but deadly boring documentary on Kurosawa. Now I have news for you, Mr Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and I for one will not give you another.
