This movie is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really need the work of making this movie. The reason is absolutely not credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dead son of a detective, but then escapes. He managed to avoid the police in the hospital - not credible that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. He takes an extremely weathered route to get out of the hospital, blow up the power plants and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And first, Andy Garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help criminals get bone marrow. The reason is such baloney! Maybe the worse movie I've ever seen.
