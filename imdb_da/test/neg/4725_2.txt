The following "review" is one from the wrong side of the tracks, which means two things: You hear nothing but praise comes from me and doesn't let me be fooled by my judgment. I could also tell you that this review does not include any spoilers, but technically ... it's a lie. <br /> <br /> Screw the review. I'm just gonna walk a little. It's been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can't enjoy this piece badly, then you simply have no sense of humor. Firstly, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that is the most important aspect where the fun comes from. The story? A doctor's son is terminally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that a heart transplant must be the only way to save his son. So, in true crazy-style style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will make art. Of course, the gorilla heart is "too powerful for a human being" so sonny-boy transforms into this hideous monkey man who immediately breaks free and continues to kill and rape (for that is simply what a horned animal would do , is it not?). Make-up of our Monkey Man is fun. There is simply no other way to put it: The boys' face looks like a turd! I speak human excrement here, the solid brown kind! Beautiful! Gore in this flick is also wonderful: Apart from real footage of an open-heart operation, we also have incredibly fake (but rather ugly) see blood and gore effects: a beheading, an eyeball, a neckline, the scalping of someone else's skull. ... It's fun, and it's actually incomprehensible why BLOODY APES NIGHT has made it the infamous British Video Nasties list, because all the nasty things depicted in this movie are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Oh, and there is only a bloody monkey running around in it too. So it is needless to say that LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more precise title for this scary and convincing story of science that has gone horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When you are not trying to shock with badly staged acts of bloody violence or random portraits of female nudity, this movie manages to be very entertaining with ingredients such as unensensing dialogues, cheap pop sets, plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting . Just a few random examples, maybe? About the Sets: You can clearly see that the set designers have just used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) again and again to build different different set sets (eg: one side of the hospital's room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestler lies, looks suspiciously like the window side of the basement laboratory where Ape-Man escapes; the set designers also took one of the side windows from the lab, made it slightly larger and just placed it in the hospital's conference room; all the walls of a building are the same crying; Clearly shot in a studio you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose.When there is something giant / rival / rape takes place, the grass just changes and mixes and you can see the gray Concrete from underneath it, just a few random lines coming out of the actors mouth: <br /> <br /> - At the conference room where all the doctors debate the unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearance that s of course would mean poor advertising for the hospital), Daddy-Doctor will intelligently withdraw "We are in a difficult situation." <br /> <br /> - In the same debate, a fellow doctor says wisely: "A sleepwalker! Every sleep promise stands up. "Herewith gives a solid excuse for the disappearance of unknowingly breaking girl. - After our investigative detective, his superior concludes and tells that the killer must be a half-human / half-animal, his superior, through the amazing process of his own logical deduction, replies that it is absurd, adds the line "It is more likely that too late, more and more, you see on your television many of these images of terror" ... Really one of the best lines in the movie. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were Daddy-Doctor and his Igor-like assistant kidnapping the gorilla from the zoo and unknowingly breaking girl from the hospital. thoughtful execution actions are like taking candy from a baby. <br /> <br /> - Daddy-Doctor speaks to God a lot, doesn't he? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy calls Daddy-Doctor "Papa "in more than one apartment. <br /> <br /> - An old lady screaming" Aaargh !! ! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man !! A deadly man !!! "The reason ceases to awaken regularly in scenes of women's wrestling, just to move on and do nothing with that concept. Of course, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny-Boy's gorilla heart another time with the unconscious breaking girl, But do you think something spectacular is happening after the "Ape-Turd-Man growing breasts or something that tries to rape men this time? Our leading live wrestling beauty (Norma Lazareno) does not even go into a climate battle with Ape-Turd-Man in near the movie's finale ... But Ape-Turd-Man begins to show some motherly love at the end ... almost (and I say "almost") in real KING KONG style (ie the top of a building and people on earth are pointing and screaming. <br /> <br /> Okay, I think that's enough now. I split in more than my two cents here Vomitron's rational assessment of this shabby piece of fun killing: 2/10. rating From the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10 See this movie, people t worth it!
