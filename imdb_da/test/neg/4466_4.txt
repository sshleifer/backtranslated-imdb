After watching the shows for a while, I looked forward to seeing Steve Martin in a comedy that I thought might be a keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only fun parts for the movie. The rest of the movie was largely a lot of junk, scenes that have been made to death, and characters we've all seen a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This movie was proof positive that if you put enough money on the table you can talk to someone for something. Steve Martin is a favorite of mine, but this one was a great clunker. The only actor in the movie that was worth seeing was Eugene Levy; he was the best of a mighty lame group.
