Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, take this cake! The movie of the movie was good, but the voltage factor kind of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. has an excellent role as a son seeking the shark that killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks and the most dangerous ones. The sea view was actually frightening at some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places. With the mini-subens weapon there, there would take a whole school of sharks there. It was good that the son would get the exact revenge on the monstrosity, even though it would actually cost him his life too. As they say revenge it has the price, but was it worth it? That answer could continue and this movie was a great letdown. The beginning was fine, and eventually it went like the Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
