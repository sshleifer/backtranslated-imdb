After an exciting start, this little drama quickly falls into the series of pure mediocrity. At the start of the movie, two women are seen (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meeting with each other while waiting for their boyfriends to come home from their vacation. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a lovely looking actress and she plays Louise; a sweet girl whose beloved girlfriend is an all-round entertainer; music, movies you name it, he does it. While telling the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham) is all about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon turns out that the similarities between their two male friends are too much .... and it is obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy. Oh God. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends, while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one. Downey is playing the kind of guy the ladies like, but men are horribly annoying; he is basically a mother's boy. The worst kind too; on the phone ringing mother all the time, persistently pushing her girlfriends with ambitious (albeit empty) promises etc. It is enough to make a normal guy sick. <br /> <br /> The movie shines consciously beyond the superior three-way love triangle movie like Jules and Jim. However, this movie does not work; mainly due to the fact that its history is so incredible. Seriously, if two women had just found out they were dating the same guy ... they wouldn't hold on to talking about it. Another reason why it falls down is that it is just so treacherous. There is no possibility for the outcome of the situation that this film presents, especially with claustrophobia to put everything in a small apartment; but the whole movie is lost in lots of dialogue; poorly written and poorly delivered dialogue, that is. The film is also massively exaggerated; It's just not credible that people would act like they do in this movie after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he showed that he could provide excellent entertaining performances, and that is something that this movie could do with. The two women are not wasted because no one expected anything from them anyway, but Downey could certainly have been better utilized. Overall? A waste of time. Don't disturb, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. That's my advice.
