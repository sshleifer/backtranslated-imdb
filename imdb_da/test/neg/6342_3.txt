But to be a little more precise, I don't think it's as bad as it actually could be. Although the actors (famous to semi-famous) did not do a very good job. Management Mistakes? Can the script also be difficult for me to say? Anyway, if you are after a lot of beautiful weapons and action, this is not the movie for you, but they run around with many ww2 vintage guns. Kind of fun :) Well, I think I could say more, but it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. If you are desperate enough or a Hackman freak see it otherwise! <br /> <br /> Live well and flourish
