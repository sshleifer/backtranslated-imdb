Who the hell is responsible for this horrible defect of one of my favorite books? This is just awful. terrible play, terrible script. The story is not even close to its old self - and what did they think? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This really counts the description. Don't see this here. Seriously, don't. Not even laughing. Especially if you are a fan of the book. This can only be the worst movie adaptation ever - everything is uneven and distorted - the characters that are important to understanding the sequence of events are severely marginalized, and any potentially interesting location from the book has changed (example: Vienna - New York) to something deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book, it is basically a fictional biography of a writer who grows up, explores his writing and so on. His mother writes an autobiography, which is greeted (despite its protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well-written, engaging and long. Its prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Robin Williams once again and tells us to grab the day.
