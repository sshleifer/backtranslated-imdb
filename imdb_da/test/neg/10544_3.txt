The poisonous Avenger, horribly deformed creature of super-human size and strength, is left in this sequel that gets most everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father on the suggestion of his psychiatrist who is in cahoots with an evil company who just wants the vane gone to get an angry game on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend having a different name in this, a much less ugly, much more comical tone and a plot line that can't hold a light to the original. Even with the completely uncomplicated version, which you can only get if you buy the Tox Box DVD set, Gore is the only one going to this. And if you do by any other version, forget about getting any benefit from it at all. Although the first one is a low budget classic, it is simply not. <br /> <br /> My character: D + <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast nip slip; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a villian becomes completely naked; and a few extras in a bathhouse scene show different amounts of skin.
