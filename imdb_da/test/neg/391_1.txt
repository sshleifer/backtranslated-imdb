It's been over 30 years now, but I still remember that this movie was the worst I've ever seen. I would have thought that something worse would have been filmed during this time, but I was wrong. I just finished watching "STARSHIP TROOPERS" and it came in very close, but it was still more entertaining than "FATTEN COW".
