Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiance, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador when their plane crashes. (That's really what should have happened to this very predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while waiting for his fiancee. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The scene with the bear is so designed. We knew it was a tame bear all the time. <br /> <br /> Complications follow when Clara shows up. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should share roads when he refuses to leave the same. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out how this will end. With all the snow, it's just too cold for anyone!
