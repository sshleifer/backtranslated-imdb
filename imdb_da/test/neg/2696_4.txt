This is one of the wonderful martial arts films that begin with two posses of hard gang members looking out into a park; And when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out that they all know karate and kung fu! The always wood Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good policeman, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police officers are trying to break up a fake ring, and when this plot line is exhausted, the story just changes to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, beautiful tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bound budget, there is a helicopter action, some speedboat activity, some car chases, a fight where Cynthia strikes everyone in a rural western bar, some swimming pools with bimbos in thong bikinis and surprisingly good horseback chase. About half a half cops are shot down. A lot of plot twists happen that just doesn't make sense; Don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I suppose they were too busy.) Fight choreography was made by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classic and twisted presence in front of the camera would honestly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and honestly she could use it; She seems tired and bored and makes her the best in GUARDIAN ANGEL when playing opposite a dog dog, to whom she delivers bitterly drunken monologues. The dog almost expels her! She also has some of the most frightening clothes that any leading lady has ever used in any movie: Loose, baggy-legged jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each dandruff were most shocking. The other players are all over the card. You can see many of the smaller characters being thrown this way: "Hello, I and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. ! " Then there are the sleepy professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the fantastic French model and veteran of "Red Shoe Diaries", "Baywatch", "Melrose Place" and playing many many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or an "alias" episode and nothing directly to cable waste like this. There is also the tall, dark and beautiful Daniel McVicar, now a regular on "The Bold and the Beautiful", John O'Leary, who has played a worthy old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arabic character actor, perhaps best known as "Pharaoh Seti" from MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most ridiculous recording on their CVs. I gave this movie a better rating than it deserves enough because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They are still a little too young to take care of what a picture quality it really was and just enjoy cheering with Cynthia as she made her lathes, kick kicking, stick-fighting things. If you like this kind of flick, you can probably enjoy it at that level.
