Bill Rebanes "The Capture of Bigfoot" is one of the most horrible horror movies ever made. A greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides he wants Bigfoot caught at all costs. But local gambler Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that Bigfoot used to live in peace disturbed by a geological expedition and set out to protect the creature. There is nothing even extremely interesting in this piece of shit. The movie is extremely boring and full of horrible songs and cheap special effects. No Gore, no excitement - just gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible unwanted like the plague.
