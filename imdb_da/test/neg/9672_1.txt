Just as I thought nothing could be as offensive and / or annoying as Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually divisive experience of renting this piece of waste. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought on criminal charges to smuggle this script into the public place. The actors must be charged as an accomplice and earn no less than a life away from the public eye. <br /> <br /> This production gives the disclaimer: "For dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts" or such insufficient statement to fully bend you to the absolute contradictory rewrite of a bible story that did not some drama added. What they added was enough to make your I.Q. Drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" taken, finds characters so bizarre, you can't recognize anything but a few names, and of course sheets. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot both live in Sodom, so maybe Abram was on vacation in Switzerland on a ski trip. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when she turns to a pillar of salt, Lot breaks his fingers and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby mend. If it's "poetic", I'm a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah - now drinking wine in quantities that could help fly the ark - whines about the hard work of the construction project, he wakes up one morning to find out that God has provided enough presut lumber to ease his burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like a delivery from 84 Lumber, nicely stacked and bundled. Maybe 84 Hours is really an agent of God ????? Instead of carrying you with the cargo being loaded, I will pamper you with the account of pirate attacks on the ark. Incongruous, do you think? This movie is filled with such insulting nonsense. After an indefinite time in the waters, Noah spies on a pirate ship that is right for them. And who can the salty sea captain be? Well, duh, that's a lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you are going to slaughter a plot line, it is all slaughtered. The piracy attempt failed, and the swashbuckling was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing me any more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, meaningless, moronic distortion of something remotely resembling a Bible account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this film is pre-developed mind abuse. Stupid and insulting, you become more entertained by reading the yellow pages.
