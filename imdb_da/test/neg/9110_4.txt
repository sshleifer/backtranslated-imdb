Away from the usual straight to video actioneer, Airborne has enough in mind to keep it in full 90 minutes, even though you can't help thinking how low past 80's comedy boy Steve Guttenburg succumbed to to be in such a cheap production (and play a hard man too!). The reason is simple, the evils have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg, and the rest of his goodie friends are sent to pick it up. Not bad of its kind, but not in the same league (of course) as the films it is compared to on the cover of AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. The game is good, but Sean Bean represents his Brit-bad guy character, which we've had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
