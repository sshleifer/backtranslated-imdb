History teacher Mrs. Tingle seems to have it for student Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart on obtaining a written school scholarship. She gets another low class from Tingle who doesn't help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper from the final story exams and strikes it in her bag, Mrs Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three that she wants to go to the principal, but he is not available. So before she reports the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott lead to her place that night and try to convince her not to tell the principal. But because of Tingle's stubbornness, they themselves return to drastic measures to stop this. <br /> <br /> Wasn't a fan of it when I first saw it and after another view I'm still not one. The author Kevin Williamson was on the run after pounding the successful modern teen film film; 'Scream (1996)', 'I know what you did last summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He ran the success (also to forget about the TV show Dawson's Creek), but this project would be the final bump. The difference that, compared to this entrance, was other than writing the script, he also made his debut under the direction. The strange thing, however, was that I found his direction to be competent, but material he stormed up to tasteless and tired. It seemed to be caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller without making it gel. The manuscript is messy with fast, ongoing gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references to other movies, but the problem is that it is for the water with so many engineered developments and sappy moral streams that disrupt the flow. The broken script had to be stronger and more powerful, as it is a small production that feels like you are seeing a stage show because of its most limited set. It tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to serve only the bad progress of stories in a sausage of stupidity and meaninglessness. The movie ends the cake. Williamson's polished direction is sound but more in a pedestrian way and therefore lacks excitement and pacings even with its tight surroundings can really plunder. You notice it after the halfway mark, and it shows how small the story is. The performance is tolerable enough, but if it wasn't for Helen Mirren's stylish icy portrayal of manipulative performances such as Mrs Tingle and a buoyant Marisa Coughlan, we would have stuck to seeing a good-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part, and Molly Ringwald has a minor role. The soundtrack packs enough energy, but I found it terrible and shapeless in its choices. <br /> <br /> Watchable but mechanical all-round.
