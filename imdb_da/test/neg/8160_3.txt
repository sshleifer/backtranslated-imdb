"San Francisco, Oh, you wonderfully deserted city, thank you, God, for destroying it and making bricks on our collective heads and for grumbling for oblivion tens of thousands of your innocent, obedient sheep, master who is so merciful in your heavenly ways ... "These should have been the lyrics of the title song to this oh-so inspiring and completely mindless movie. The movie starts well enough, with Gable discovering a Cinderella with a very annoying but much appreciated operative voice, and she quickly shoots to stardom. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if you "take time" to look through the entire makeup facade and 30s, she understands that she is a little ugly. Too ugly to play this role, anyway. But Gable and everyone else felt like she was a shameful beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so completely humble, healthy, innocent, godly, kind and generous - enough to make you vomit in a full hour. MacDonald plays her (admittedly one-dimensional) role with the kind of "ahhh", "oh" and "ooh" that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this cliché, gold-loving, non-child-smuggling priest (who's boxing in his "spare time" - as if the priests have something to do - so sweet ). Even the ever-reliable gable is not up to his usual standard; He is far too animated, and his character is far too selfless for a person who should be an ambitious Western "scoundrel" (though, of course, this is the script's fault). The reason is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping-pong with cinderella - using her as the ball. How? Now she works primarily for Gable, so she works for the Holt square, then she goes back to Gable, to only return to Holt. (And of course both will have her as a boyfriend / wife.) And if the earthquake hadn't interrupted this table tennis plot, it's a safe bet that she would have jumped back and forth another ten times, the wishy-washy little princess who she is. <br /> <br /> There are many, too many, musical numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "disaster movie musical" ever. How stupid. The things she sings in Gables' "joint" are okay, but when she begins to bend the tall, annoying wines in the opera segments, that was when I felt my ears were unknowingly and unfairly attacked by the enemy sound fire. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMES MINUTES. 6 may seem like little to those who have not had first-hand Vietoperanam experience of such horrors of sound torture, but it is like with dog years; a dog's year corresponds to seven people. One minute of opera corresponds to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating acid on the leg). I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's more like a disaster movie. (I read that part of the dialogue in this movie is written by a SILENT-ERA MOVIE DIRECTOR. Jesus ...) The melodramatic, and only occasionally entertaining, procedure is interrupted by the real star of this movie (namely, the earthquake) only after well over an hour and a half. When the Joe earthquake finally shakes up in the city and our cliché figures in it, I almost felt like saying "God, death and destruction is finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe enters the movie too late to save it from its increasing mediocrity; The scenes of destruction are very good, but even the earthquake in the film is destroyed by a very annoying, religious end. You see, Gable, who testifies to being an atheist all the time (without using the word itself) finally finds MacDonald alive - after searching for days - and suddenly he turns into a believer because Cinderella lives? !! How stupid! All that tells me is that Gables character is a weak mind. <br /> <br /> The movie ends on a very stupid note. Gable, who has said "thank you" to God for "saving" his girl (and he does his knee) "finds" God (sees the light), and the film's little old devil Gable turns into a believer. How Much God Terrible American Ends ... <br /> Of course, no one was thinking of asking this "God," why in hell there was an earthquake in the first place! The sad and unintentional irony is that Gable eventually becomes a "sucker"; All the time he had made fun of "suckers" who fall into their sacred very best scams - namely religion - and eventually he himself becomes one. Now I call a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the end should have improved Gable as a person, but I see it completely different; on the contrary, it only took a great joe to turn Gable into a godly, sensual, small, obedient believer - who joins the sheep family of the world. And, as if this Gable's intellectual decline was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this first "earthquake music" ends with a real hairstyle (take this word as you like), noble and hope inspiring beautiful mass choir scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud , proud, healthy citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or may "God" perhaps fix it?) sing all the title song in the hope of a better and brighter, joe-less future. Hallelujah! If you're a "sucker" for Hollywood sentimentality, don't skip this movie.
