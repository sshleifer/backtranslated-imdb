I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review that gave this movie a suspected high 9/10 rating. I say suspicious because it looks like a review, but more like a public statement. Maybe the filmmaker himself or one of his fellows has written "review"? Creepy, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV and expect it to be really terrible. The special effects that were used should be honest, very good for a low budget film, and some of the actors were not so bad either, but most of the play was really awful but well done to try, which I expect the most were the movie player's friends. <br /> <br /> I think the film maker has done really well trying to beat his weight. I found some of the movie fun because it was trying to be super cool as it just wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this movie seriously and see it while it is full of some friends, it may well be good, but probably not as it was intended. This movie is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh considering it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due to credit to those involved in its production.
