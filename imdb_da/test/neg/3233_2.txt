Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in films such as "Licensed To Drive" he was more in his element ... lowbrow humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" was one of his earlier works, and probably his finest to date. Unfortunately, this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog, a horrified mutant and a genetic experiment has gone wrong, slaughtered terribly. The action is so lifeless, you might think you're watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you would be better off seeing "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... okay, maybe not "CHOMPS" < br /> <br /> If you've read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you haven't read the book, read it and avoid this movie. You will thank me later. <br /> <br /> A somewhat better translation of a Dean Koontz book is the talented thriller, "Phantoms".
