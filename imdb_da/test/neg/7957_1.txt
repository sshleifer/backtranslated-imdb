Copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical story line. The way the protagonists fall in love, so rebel and the climax are the same in both of these films! "Call Girl" is better than Water, at least from the story telling point of view. It was not as agonizing slowly as Water! Water on the other hand does not develop at all. Perhaps the goal is to make the audience sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than just being good copiers these days? Well they call it "inspired". In their language, it is: "to be inspired (without any reference there!)"! :)
