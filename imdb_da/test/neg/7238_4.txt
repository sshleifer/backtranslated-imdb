When I saw the first squid film, it was a laugh to see the cheesy and horrible effects. This movie seemed to make up for the play, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, why, why not make a movie about a killer squid? The octopus invades New York's waters, where 2 police investigators try to stop shaking animals before July 4. A pretty clean plot and pedigree stories, but squid was pretty shaky, it was great to see they actually made it this time, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better on a big budget really, this movie could have been a good watch . There is a continuous amount of errors where it would not surprise me if they do not investigate the way octopus lives ... See this if you like cheap DVD sequels, otherwise you see better on Jaws.
