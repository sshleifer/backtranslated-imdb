Not a balanced point of view. The director should not express his opinion as truth. The film has some criticism of Fujimori, but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori were given that it seems that the only reason they were included was to say that the film gives both views. But that is not the case. The film hardly shows one of the massacres Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him the credit for masterminding the murder of the MRTA rebels who took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA has planned. There are even pictures of a well-known CIA strategist on the site published by Careta's magazine and other newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact that such known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions: the director is pro-fujimori and chooses deliberately to give him the credit director does not want viewers to note that the CIA and Fujimori worked together; or it was just out of ignorance as the director was not peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time of the events. The explanation from other commentators that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru does not apologize for the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> The statistics in the movie for the actual support of Fujimori were also the highest I have ever heard of. Most statistics from major polling offices are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was the key to catching the leader of Sendero and discovering the secret network was made by a police force led by Ketin Vidal and he had full autonomy from Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> The first government in Fujimori saw an improvement in overall economic development (GDP), but this improvement was funded by the privatization of several national industries with contracts it did not benefit the country in the long term. The gap between rich and poor also continued to increase under Fujimori's regime. In its second period, the economy suffers and there was nothing else to privatize, and at the end of Fujimori's second period, the economy was breaking down. <br /> <br /> In terms of investing in infrastructure of Fujimori's regime, they fall into the paternalistic pattern. They were created to support Fujimori, but were not supposed to last long. These structures required continued maintenance, but Fujimori did not give civilian political power to demand additional investment. In fact, Fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization such as associations and grassroots groups, and the increase in informal disorganized labor was enormous. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to Fujimori instead of citing massive corruption cases in favor of Fujimori (Media, Business Owners, Military, etc.) that were so widely spread that It was impossible that Fujimori was not aware of it.
