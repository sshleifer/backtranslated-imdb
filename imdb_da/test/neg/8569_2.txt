I didn't buy this, I didn't rent it, it was on PPV and someone burned a copy of it and lent it to me, so at least I didn't waste any money on it. For someone who made darkness, the nameless, the devil's backbone, it's a pretty boring movie. Seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls who were at a monastery back in the day, and now they are all adults and they are being persecuted and killed one by one by a nun coming out of the kitchen sink, toilet, and even manage to negotiate revolving doors at a hotel. And what makes this nun so cute and uncomfortable (and wet?) I wasn't so bored that at some point halfway through I just stopped it, put it away and looked at something else. Wasn't even interested in finding out really. Oh, there are some lovely young ladies to look at, but hey, are two of them lesbians? I think there is a picture on the bedside table of a young lady bedroom, and what self-respecting horror movies would not be complete these days without a lesbian couple? Yes what. 2 out of 10 if you want to see a worthy non-horror movie, try "Desecration", "Dead Waters" or "The Convent" (and that's the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich).
