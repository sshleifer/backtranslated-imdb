Potential viewers are warned, the current IMDb viewer rating for "Tomorrow at Seven" is an irregularity of low voting turnout. It has an interesting premise, a killer leaves a spade of Ace of Spades card on his crimes while warning the victim in advance. However, the design falls flat, and to say that the film has its share of plot holes, it would mean that there is actually a plot. Chester Morris portrays mysterious writer Neil Broderick, weaving elements of actual murder of spades' killer in his latest novel. Broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to go past the man's eccentric secretary - "If you control his relatives, you probably have to hold a Ford together". This line gives him uncertainty for the "nut" daughter Martha (Vivienne Osborne) who offers to introduce. <br /> <br /> Broderick meets with Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson), as the latter is completing a puzzle puzzle delivered by a courier that morning. The only remaining pieces that we learn in the following scene form the bold, black form of the Spades, which contains the words "In the morning". Now, the person who puts together a puzzle does not use the pieces with contrasting colors FIRST! <br /> <br /> I was initially intrigued by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles as a few police detectives called for the Drake residence. Generally, their characters are colorful enough to offer true comic relief, but here they are just pretty annoying. McHugh's Clancy is particularly keen on shouting objections to inane comments from his partner Dugan, and both usually go in the opposite direction when real problems can arise. <br /> <br /> Now, there is a question - given the identity of the ace killer, why would he have invited a novelist and a few police officers he just met on a flight to his Louisiana plantation? Especially when at seven o'clock all parties would be a captured audience aboard the aircraft when the first murder was committed. It's not Drake, but who's dead, but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The early suspicion falls on the pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) after a bright out scene, but Henderson still has not reported the murder to his supervisor before coming to Drake's plantation with everyone else. Can you imagine someone trying to get away with it today, unless your name was Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> With the cause of death not yet determined, the local is being rejected, but the first one showing up (a Broderick accomplice) is a fake. Yet he simply disappears immediately after the real rejection In another dark out scene, a letter from the murder victim Austin Winters is being read. It blows up when the lights return, and because it can point to the killer, it gets a little to be retrieved. So where was the letter? Winter daughter Martha grabbed it and placed herself on the mantle in the living room! How much thought was put into this? Of course, the whole affair is so horrible that Morris's character solves the matter quite easily. Even if the film comes in about an hour, it is almost a task to see with all the nonsense that goes on. There is really only a humorous moment that is worth repeating; while on board the detectives have this exchange: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> Aside from McHugh and Jenkins, I can't say I've seen any of the other players in ear movies, although I'm a fan of most "B" grade mystery movies from '30' through the '50s. Luckily, the couple fares much better backing up Humphrey Bogart in a goofy 1938 gem - "Swing Your Lady" where grin is deliberate. The best thing I can offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters about halfway, though this turkey - "This is just a stupid waste of time".
