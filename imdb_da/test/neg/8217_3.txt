The film successfully gives a graphic depiction of the suffering of forced sex work, but no more. The left-wing agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves the viewer so embarrassed as you see if you know that feeling. Thus, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex-Yugoslav territory to work as a sex slave because the US military institutions are corrupt and look away while their private security contracts sell people abroad. You don't need a half brain to see the relevance of the Iraq War and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What load of left wing! It seems that I have been deceived all my life into believing that this problem and many others were a direct result of Communism's grip on this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war against Iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms and constipation last week. The film ignores that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and access to the western block. You also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair. We have someone who leaves a woman in London's streets in broad daylight, beats her up and, in turn, pulls her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. No one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman doesn't care to scream during the hunt. Even better, we later see 4-5 women lined up in the center of London in-agent-wide daylight to be sold, one of them has a broken face, and people act in the background as if nothing happened. You can't make this stupidity up. <br /> <br /> I used to think that such trash was exclusive to Hollywood, but apparently I was wrong.
