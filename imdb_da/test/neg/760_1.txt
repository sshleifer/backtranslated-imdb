A horrible movie; badly written, badly acted, clich√©, hackneyed, dross. The premise is so good and a chance to educate on black cowboys, but the movie is really grim. It's a curious mix of a bad 1950s Randolph Scott B movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western. The bad guys are cardboard, flashbacks ridiculous, the dialogue scary. The conscious anachronism (like "Victorian rapeseed and modern swear words like" motherf **** is ") is annoying to the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster who died on the lab word.
