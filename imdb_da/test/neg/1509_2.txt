Really terribly incomparable waste. This movie does everything wrong, except to run for an hour. Gore FX challenges gravity and logic. There is no scare. The action is immense, with everyone who seems to read their lines. There is a surprise that is just silly where we find out that things we happened to did not even happen. Boy I hate cop out conclusions! They throw this thing out with long drawn-out pictures of people who do nothing interesting (like putting on makeup or talking for what seems like forever). Do you have to film a movie that is under an hour long? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty freakin 'thin. I think it's just a variation of the film APRIL FOOL'S DAY, if I remember that movie properly, and that movie wasn't that great either. The only good thing I can say seems to have been shot well. Too bad nothing happens that is very exciting.
