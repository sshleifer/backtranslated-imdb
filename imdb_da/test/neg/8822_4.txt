Strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring to the unforgettable husband / wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie is not as bad as most in its genre, but is still high on the cheese factor. Includes several bargain cellar zombies, outrageous campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / kinky tomb robbers, and a shining soundtrack. Wife Anya puts on a performance that is so strange you have to ask herself if she really does. There are very worst pictures of this kind during the era (look for Al Adamson flic), but it's not Night of the Living Dead. Director / Writer "Benjamin" Clark, is really Bob Clark who continued to create the clean "Porky's" early 80s exploitation disasters. He has just rebuilt after an inexplicable movie ("A Christmas Story") to return to his terrible ways of "Baby Geniuses". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the kinky Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell version of "Cat People". Moocow says watch this hippy horror movie next to fun, zombie frolics and campy dialog: = 8)
