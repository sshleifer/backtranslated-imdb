One would think that with the incredible background of WWII Stalingrad, the authors would come up with a script. Nix. There is no story here! It's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic, rude and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A bunch of Germans are marching around shooting and being shot. Slowly there are fewer Germans marching around, shooting and being shot. Then there are no Germans to march around, shoot and get shot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
