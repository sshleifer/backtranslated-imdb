This movie starts on the wrong foot and never gets it right. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing, and just outside the window you can clearly see mountains in the background. For those of you who may have never been to Houston, there is no altitude change. The city is just above the sea level and a 5 foot slope is considered a large hill. To go along with that landscape, tell any shot outside the hospital immediately the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or pine trees, and neither Houston has much of it. Even the hospital itself on the outside is very incredible. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the United States and sits smack dab in the middle of the Medical District just miles from downtown Houston, but every exterior shot of the hospital seems to make the hospital out in the suburbs or even the countryside. It is obvious that the one responsible for the actual tropical storm part of the movie shrieked out because the many shots of radar are all wrong. The first radar image in the movie is that Hurricane Hugo hits South Carolina. We later see that Kris Kristofferson leaves his job, and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving back south over Houston, but the radar image he shows, Alison has clearly moved north of the Gulf of Mexico in Houston. Probably the first landing of Alison. <br /> <br /> As far as the play is concerned, it's not that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering this is a straight-to-TV movie. The plot of history is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a little more entertaining. My one problem with the play is the portrayal of the Houstons with big thick southern accents ... the actors sound like they are from Birmingham, Alabama and not Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The movie gets its point across and to the general audience makes it exactly what it is supposed to: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, then you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before watching this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on the Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on the Houston Metro itself. If you are looking for a factual account of Tropical Storm Alison's influence on the Houston metro, I suggest to see The Weather Channel Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison. <br/> <br /> * 1/2 out of *****
