Historical films always take liberties - conversations are gathered where no one could actually know what was said, the customs are prepared to be understandable to modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about real historical personalities should at least make it possible to minimize history. This movie doesn't. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, "I can't remember sending to room service". The main entertainment value is in its poorness; I recommended my local video story put it on the "turkeys" shelf.
