This is by far the worst Hemingway fit ever. Rock Hudson was badly mistaken and quite unbelievable as a hard-bitten soldier / fairy tale drawn to war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her, and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think he was acting in another movie altogether. They were trying to make a great epic out of a low-Norwegian romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if that were not enough, the whole thing is so slow, long-lasting and dated that it can hardly be connected. Rock must have kicked itself to knock down "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to make this awful crap. <br /> <br /> 0/10. Avoid.
