Naach would have won a Razzie for the worst movie in 2004 (can also be too) if it was global. When it comes to bad (aka showing attitude / gab / over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While catwoman had a big line, apparently hot actress in microscopic costume and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of the movies that makes me wonder why IMDb allows one to judge a movie as 0/10. Once again, I think the movie does not even deserve a 0. It must be something negative or minus infinite. OK what about the plot overview? It is a foundational, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meets an unusable, skill, loafer that strives to be an actor tale. The story is so short that if just another sentence, IMDb can ban me from writing a spoiler. About the storytelling? Its like a bunch (sorry 2 people mostly) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you purchased a new DVD player. You would end up believing that either DVD is in bad shape or DVD player is hit. Not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of it all, you stop giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) cannot speak convincingly, so there are not so many dialogues in this movie. So you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying sounds from these anthra-template song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to watch a Bollywood movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There can be no worse 3 hours of torture than this!
