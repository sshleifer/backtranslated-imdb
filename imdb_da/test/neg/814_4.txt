"Jaded" provides a potential with potential as it looks at rape of a woman of two other women and asks the question "when is rape not rape?". Unfortunately, the girl seems to be suffering from a bad direction as it strikes the legal minutia while trying to weave a kind of story with a handful of spooky, mouth-watering and depicted characters only to end abruptly. "Jaded" is the lame thing only for the soft eye couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.
