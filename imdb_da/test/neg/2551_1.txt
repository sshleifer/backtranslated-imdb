In the dusty little town of Furlough in Texas, an animal beats cattle and locals. When teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, their friends, Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), his Mexican-American girlfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) find that a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they draw a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "Texas Werewolf" is an amateur boy and among the worse movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the manuscript is ridiculous, with some of the most horrible lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". The amateur play seems to be a prank of high school students or a high school. "Special effects" are cruel and extremely poor, and "werewolf" is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood movie is cool, but this "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is pure waste. In the end, Jill says no one can resist her teats (actually the most beautiful thing in this flick). But I think the correct quote should be "no man (or woman) can resist seeing this movie to the end". I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be, and I lost 88 minutes in my life, but I think most of the viewers will stop watching with less than 20 minutes of playing time. My voice is a (terrible) one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
