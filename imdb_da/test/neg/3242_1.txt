Oh if someday you will see a supernatural thriller turn out to be a comedy watch this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was a shocker as it had so many players in it, but what they do and how they fit in? <br /> <br /> The management of college scenes is like a school game where every person comes to talk and then comes the next person inside. <br /> <br /> Okay reasons to laugh at the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as a college student 2) Akshay carries a pistol in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX <br / > <br /> There are several more errors that why not snake save his lover from being raped and coming so late? also why does he not kill them all on the contrary? <br /> <br /> But then they have to make a 2 hour + movie, so you have a torture movie <br /> <br /> The movie is painful to watch The movie was directed by Rajkumar Kohli, an expert in Make such films earlier and have successfully recorded films such as JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli will help his son's non-existent career. From VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all flops, he tried hard to promote his son, and he also threw great stars, so his son was noticed. Unfortunately, nothing can help his son's career <br /> <br /> The movie has several comic scenes like death scenes, how the actors after beating the snake are so apt to fight him again and climax. The Direction of Rajkumar Kohli's Bad Music is Bad <br /> <br /> It brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - common thing, he doesn't have much to do rather than stunts Suneil Shetty-horrible Sonu Nigam-the worst deb outward price goes to him, he gives cartoon that seems a new meaning Aftab-terrible Arshad Wars - nothing to do Sharad Kapoorbad Aditya Panscholirir Sunny Deol - is comical in the scene when he comes to rescue Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala - Ordinary Rambha - Akshay's pair Kiran Kumar, Raza Murad is, as usual, Raj Babbar - fun for wrong reasons, the girls are terrible, which brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a great physique, he is even stronger and taller than Akshay Kumar Unfortunately he over like the poor man Akshay His voice is horrible, his expression is painful The only thing he has to do in the movie is to take glasses and make an evil face Rajat Bedi is terrible
