I suppose this board will soon be filled with comments from over-emotional people presenting "Dear John" as a "gem" and a "roller coaster ride" and all the other vacuum words typically used by the movie's audience. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not this movie's target audience, but I also don't like romantic dramas as long as they are well done, so here's my goal to take on the girl. <br /> <br /> It's not good. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot weakens, the development stagnates where it should have been forward (just around the middle, to be precise), and for the end ... it almost felt like they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said, "Hey , let's just film a final scene really fast, put some sentimental string soundtrack over it and finish it that way. " Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfred could not save this. Channing Tatum also gave a good performance, but you can only do so much with a wrong script. <br /> <br /> Talk about the music, it is unbearably predictable and kitchy. From the smokey voiced, annoying, high-haired female singer Schtick (certainly chosen to appeal to the majority of college-age girls who will go watch this movie) to the overused "shimmering strings and piano" combo, it only annoys someone paying more attention to the movie as a whole rather than to its own "feelings". The movie has a good start, and the great conflict that launches us into the second act was all promising. So was part of the other act itself when the story was unfolded. Then the movie just dropped the ball. Besides that, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it doesn't seem like it should. If you want to see a really moving movie about long-lasting love waiting to be reunited, see "Notebook" which was truly amazing.
