I like this movie and have seen my copy twice since acquired it a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. I haven't checked the dates, but I bet this movie came out after and certainly at the same time as Collier and the Walt Disney popularization of the Vision of Spaceflight is promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in attempts to act factually correctly and scientifically. However, while some ideas are cross-over (eg, step amplifiers) pretty much correct, other things are hilariously wrong. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to a height and then becomes 90 degrees to enter the room ... like reaching the top of a staircase and turning to the landing! Then we are told that by turning in the direction of the Earth's rotation, the overall speed of the ship is increased accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. Most space launch centers are located as close to the equator as possible, where the earth and everything on the surface rotate about a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket that goes out to space, toward the east (the same as the planet's rotation). Although the ship turned to travel west once in space, its speed relative to the earth's surface would be greater, but of course it would not add anything to the actual vehicle speed. Written in this movie as "Aviation"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers only feel free harvesting or "weightlessness" when they reach some thousand miles from the Earth outside the planet's gravitational field. Again, comic wrong. Most crew-reported spacecraft travel no more than a few hundred miles up, but as long as they (and their content, including crew) travel at an appropriate rate, their momentum in an outward direction balances inward gravity, they will free fall. Of course, travel far enough from Earth, and even a slow object will coast well beyond the Earth's gravity well, but to leave the Earth's orbit, outwardly (toward the Moon for example) requires the achievement of "flight speed", about one and a half miles an hour. So the vehicle has already reached "rotational speed" (and "weightlessness") per vehicle. Definition. <br /> <br /> But the film has far more hilarious things than this. Someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon because of a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find that they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain thus rumors that this must have been divine intervention! At which point, any form of being scientifically torn into small pieces like confetti and thrown in the wind in the midst of the joyous dance in an increasingly barmy plot. The strength of a movie like this is actually in illustrating "how far we have come". Not least in attitudes towards women. The patronizing drive built on the female crew member is both fun and shocking. To believe that such attitudes were so recently "normal". As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining, like a late night, shining through the romance of traveling in outer space, from today's perspective, before it actually happened. An antidote to the cold routine of space flight, as it has now become in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal the end. It is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.
