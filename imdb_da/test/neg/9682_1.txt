This rendering of "Noah's Ark" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. But production has its bright side ... an educational experience for neophyte film entrepreneurs in "how not to make a movie" Where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense one can find these quotes and situations: <br /> <br /> "Okay, boys, let's saddle up." "It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night." "We don't kiss ... we only whisper in each other's mouth." <br /> <br /> Timber to build the Ark of the "Georgia Pacific" stamped on it. Metal nails. Children flying kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep after this) sell Chinese hats. Pirates attacked a wooden ark that they wanted to capture, with fiery tar balls of fire shot from catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in a continuous state of inibriation. It was a miracle that he could see the ark let alone build it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blonde pearl trumping around the sheet on a white horse ... still G) Defend Biblical pirates with an iron iron pan (Teflon lined?). Landing on Mount Ararat after passing Hercules Straights. <br /> <br /> etc. Contract. Special effects ... you have to see them in order not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This movie must not be missed; but if you want the full TV version, call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree to abolish NBC of all responsibility for ever having aired the case in the first place. Only the discontinued version is available in video stores (no pirates, etc.) ... that is, the video stores that dare to store it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
