This sequel to the above - and the final entry into the "Kharis" series - is a bit more enjoyable at all, but it is also more constructed (hell, we even get a singing barmaid / hostess!): Peter Coe is easy on it least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests we have seen during these films, and Martin Kosleck as his craftsman seems uninterested in the matter; Kurt Katch is then sitting with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess Ananka: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a very used character actress), gets her the most significant role and indeed the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this movie but the whole series. Unfortunately, here too Chaney has valuable things to do, as once again emphasis is placed on Ananka, as I have said; his mummy (which he most often came upon at Universal - from his obviously from his signature role of The Wolf Man!) will undoubtedly remain his least memorable monster for the studio.
