When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.oo in a local store, it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a roll of such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard I looked forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mix of plot and scenes that do not fully convince. However, I am so glad I saw this movie as I now have the memorable saying: 'Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by. This should sum up everyone's life. Choose these seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
