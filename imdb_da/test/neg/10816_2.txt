"The Cave" was released more or less at the same time as the English film "The Descent" directed by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar premise; Only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the amazing horror adventure that is "The Descent". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too bad and immediately added brilliant ideas, depth and a personal style, while "The Cave" director Bruce Hunt simply went to the most rudimentary draft of the manuscript that was thrown at his desk . The result is an incredibly mediocre movie that contains every horror cliché you can think of and where most of the violence is on the screen. And we all hate it, don't we? The story introduces a clip of insufficient cave divers caught in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Hidden wings, which are also parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to landslides. The first half hour is still mildly entertaining, if you keep busy spotting all the clichés and listening to the osteic textbook dialogs, but it all gets too deep. None of the events is even slightly plausible, and it seems that the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the WORST performance. I have already seen better special effects in anonymous B movies, the movies are not used to the full, and the end is just as good! Very much not recommended!
