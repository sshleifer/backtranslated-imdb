From all the rave reviews we couldn't wait to see this show. We love wacky humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit that this may not be a fair review as we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we just couldn't bear more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we ever saw watching a TV show - it felt like 15 hours. The songs can be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted in an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying hard to delete the memory. If you want some wonderful down-under humor in a nice and engaging movie, see "The Dish" instead.
