OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. The guy didn't learn to stop, did he? First, he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now he utilizes Loch Ness Monster as evil. <br /> <br /> "The reason" is basically about some Southeasters of the United States pretending to be Scottish camping out on Loch Ness. Alas out on the fishing hole, oops, I mean Loch Ness's lake, which is a killer inflatable monster that clings to Nessie, goes out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised the MST3K crew has never heard of this movie. Yes, it's so bad too.
