K, one day my dad picked up a movie with a 'nice' cover. Come home with my mom and we were like yay lets see this new movie we never saw before! .. Okay, then it started ... interesting start, cool robots and obnoxious gore (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto not it?) Blablabla I could tell the whole story, but I also don't want to point, WTF NEVER Retrieving a movie with a lama ass name, and seriously doesn't ever think that I ever judge a book on the cover (err tape ..) it looked like an interesting movie. IF it was a slap to the face of the sci-fi movie, it's DISGUSTING. I think it was so bad I just started to laugh (I swear it is hard to be serious) I can't describe the STUPIDITY! It killed more than a million brain cells by me, I can't even write a descent criticism. IT'S BAD! Argh and I wana prepare you for something "odd" * BUY COUGH * Mechanical p3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Sorry just to say it is so much fun, think of it as a comedy or a sci-fi movie parody . The classic batman laughs, but in a new packaging. What the hell did this instructor think?
