This movie had terrible lighting and horrible camera movements. This movie is a jumping horror flick without any sense whatsoever. The slashes are completely false in appearance. It looks like a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie, and a 10-year-old kid shot it. With the worst play you can ever find. People are tired of knives. At least move on to weapons or fire. It has almost exact lines from "When a Stranger Calls". With horrible killings, only crazy people would enjoy this movie. It is obvious that the author does not have children or even cares for them. I mean to show some mercy. To sum up, this movie is a "B" movie and it is sucked. Just for your own sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie.
