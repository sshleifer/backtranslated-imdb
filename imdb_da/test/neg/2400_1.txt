The filmmakers neglected to connect the dots - that is, the order of events and elections that led from Charlie Wilson and anti-Soviet mujahedin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and finally to 9/11. Of course, the filmmakers fail to tell us the back story - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? - but this omission falls in relation to their lack of disclosure of support for Islamist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of the refined anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-Western forces and was a major contributor to the clutter we find today (9/11, the terrorist network, a prolonged war in Afghanistan, etc.). Because these consequences are not spelled out, the film leaves the viewer sympathetically with Mr. Wilson (hey, check out his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the interests of his country and the West as a whole.
