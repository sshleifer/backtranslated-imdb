As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as production manager on this movie ... my very first! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone participating. Look carefully, and you'll even see me in one of the open scenes, like a soon-to-be-murdered asylum man named ... "Cely" (my own surname). <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Hostages", this image was changed to "Another Son of Sam" by the Producer-Director who wanted to redeem the serial killer in the news at that time. Nothing could have helped. I don't even think this picture was good enough to appear on "MST 3K!" The film was shot primarily with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and early Arriflex handheld cameras. In fact, the shot of the helicopter under the hostage coating was filmed with my own WWII era Arri. The picture was filmed entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina in the mid-seventies. Most of the "Stars" were local television news, and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or credible enough to believe in former stuntman and Producer Director, Dave A, Adam's delusions of adequacy. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy seeing this kind of picture, you can love the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
