This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost stories and thriller thriller conventions, none of which are fully realized and all are quite annoying. The script was perfunctory. It's acting, yeah. The scary FX was mostly ridiculous except for an exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though I saw it coming a mile away. Explain to me why you want ghosts, and black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and count Crapula CG Boogeymen, and psychic investigators, and family curses, and Irish superstitions and milk bowls discharged to supernatural beings AND possess dollies, all in same movie? With all that you would expect more than a good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
