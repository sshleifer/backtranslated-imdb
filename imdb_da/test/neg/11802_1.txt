Okay, they tell you that's right. They do not list any writers or directors, but a view of this movie will show to anyone - it is not true that you had hoped for. The speakers rarely appear as really natural talk ... but also sounds like not being written. (possibly resolved scripted). For me it sounded much more like they always tried to ad-lib. (which they almost always did badly). Therefore, they knew that they were making a 'movie' that not only collected real natural footage. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had some places to look for things that were created ... and they were just told to ad lib about it all. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ************************ <br /> Okay, it's so boring. Every thing, the place, or things that can be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. Let me listen to the ridiculously obviously fake things that happened as I remember: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes to enter the house, they light a light switch - the bright sparks and a chandelier almost fall a guy. <br /> <br /> 2) They find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife * in it while exploring the basement. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a noise in an armoire so they open the door slowly - BAM - a cat is being in there and jumping right at the camera as you scream. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they come to see that there is a hole in the wall, so let's keep our hand in ... wow, they drew a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the ceiling, uh-oh it feels "heavy" up here .... BOOM - a chair flies over the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl who was afraid of bugs had a ROACH in her sandwich! LAUGH OUT LOUD! .... ridiculous. 7) Let's get out of the Ouija table ... oops, one of the legs of the chute fell from the side of the board. It couldn't be because the people pushing it could do it? (they find out a ghost called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was the noise in the chimney ... CLINK - oh, my hangers fell out "I think she * kept people up here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now the blind girl is ready to look at the chimney ... oh, what is it here she sees something ... and asks people who do not look up the chimney what it is . SWISH - It falls right at her. (perfect camera shot) She moves right in time. It was more chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we must separate and each 'clean' our designated rooms - it would not be if things started happening one by one to these people now ... okay: <br /> <br /> CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly shaking her room ... but no one's doing. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: Actually saying to himself "Charles, is it you Charles ... it can't be you because you're just a fantasy of my imagination, you're not Charles". Well guess what, he is beaten and pulled over the floor. Another lucky camera shot. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hearing things .. Try to communicate ... and stand there and get tired or something. DUDE # 2: He was in the loft he reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter .... I can't remember what more. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, becomes Chick # 2 .. they hear chick and guy # 1 screaming ... they find them chained to a wall and attached to a table. (*) They leave. Cut to black. Finally, the text tells us that they fled safely, were treated for minor cuts. They have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by the name of a person named "Charles". <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ********* over ********** ********** <br /> Okay, when I first heard this movie was made, I didn't wait. I thought it was right. REAL, real. - and more professional, with more professional type of people. I love the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I will love to see really joking footage. Before this movie was released I saw couple reviews of it by people online. They both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were .. time passed I forgot the movie .... so I realized that it was never released at theaters. So I found out it went straight to the video, rented it .... found out that any brutal review was absolutely true. It's too bad, I really wanted to feel good. <br /> <br /> Random thought: The house didn't seem to have TVs, radios. Kitchen appliances that I remember ... which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. The house in particular is really known to be haunted ... I'm absolutely sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and tidy ... and what was a cat there? The property is not close to neighbors. <br /> <br /> All in all, you will only rent this if you and your friends will sit there and make fun of it ... or if you have heard about it long ago and it fascinated you. (You will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or real movie). Random thought: I think the manufacturer says "The footage" you see is real. "Well, technically, it is real footage, isn't it? Real footage of fake hauntings? Maybe it was his loop hole. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a star - strictly to tell the story of Madame LaLaurie, a real New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best achievement was the guy who teaches the ghost hunters participants at the start. of course actually really ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
