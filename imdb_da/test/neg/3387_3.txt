Last night I sit in my TV room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the TV tray, and I decide to put the movie "Monster Man" in my credible VCR. Expect a fun, gory, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, dreadful and predictable movies I've ever had the dissatisfaction with sitting through. And what's even worse, all (& I use this next sentence resolved) "sex scene" girl keeps all her clothes on! I will make this summary short and sweet: mix "Dude Where's My Car" (about a good 1/2 of the movie) with a very watery "Hitcher", add a redneck version of the "I Madman" antagonist as the primary villain and Finally, some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo and you will have a clue how the mess this movie is. It is also completely predictable throughout. The only notable factor for this buddy film disguised as a "horror movie" is that some moments between the two guys (although "the deer" is a great annoying geek, the other is a Jack Black clone) is fun fun (just mediocre fun, ie as most of the SNL sketches). Apart from that, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (I have to hand this out at Halloween time - just hope that the person has seen what I do not get my house eggs or worse)
