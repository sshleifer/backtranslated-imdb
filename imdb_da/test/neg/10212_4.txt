Being a wrestling fan sucks movies about wrestling in general (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story), but this is not the worst I have ever seen. Yes it's bad, but it's better than some of the others I've mentioned. Hulk Hogan stars as basically themselves and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on the network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand .... image USA Network has Rip ... and TNT will go in some lengths to get him. <br /> <br /> Is it sensible ... no? Well, you don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. It also doesn't make sense to have a legit ex con have a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie. None of this movie makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling movies and later Hogan movies its not that bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
