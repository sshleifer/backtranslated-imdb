Jerry Lewis was marginally fun when he did not write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started writing and managing his own films, his little egoism was overshadowed by the little talent he had. When his film would fail (and deserve it) on the American market (they made money in France), Lewis is always due to everyone and everything but himself; For example, he blamed this film for saying that, according to Lewis, it was released on a double bill with the "Deep Throat" porn feature. If anyone should have complained about that situation, it should have been the producers of "Deep Throat." This is a completely idiotic "comedy" about the world's richest man (Lewis) who is rejected for military service in World War II and decides to equip a special "team" to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many flaws this movie has (the manuscript is senselessly eerie, Lewis's "direction" is non-existent, the movie looks like a cheap home video), Lewis seemed to embrace with no talent, over -hill Borscht Belt comics Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea; He must have thought they would be so bad they would make him look good. He was half right; They are embarrassingly bad, but he comes out even worse than they do. For a "comedy", Lewis's character is hungry, angry and upset; The way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you doubt why they would ever follow a bullying as such on a dangerous mission like trying to catch Hitler. The fact that this movie has no money at all is amazing. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I've heard that "slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can't bring myself to see if it's true or not - and must be avoided at all possible costs.
