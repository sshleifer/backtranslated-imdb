This movie promised a lot, so many beautiful and good acting actors, but with a plot that almost had nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could have been developed and elaborated, but they were all lost and not taken care of. There was no story to be told, just a show off of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - all empty. But again, the play was excellent, so many of the individual scenes were entertaining, but as you became more and more aware of the lack of substantiated ideas, the actor lost her mind. So from the promising start you became more and more disappointed when the non-story went together.
