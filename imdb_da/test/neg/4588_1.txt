The game of hockey I play and watch has something called "speed", as the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to catching. In addition, a story that is clich√©, predictable and stupid than stupid with some of the music of the 80's that number your senses in each scene, and you have "Youngblood". Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, whatever. Gimme Dunlop, Braden and Hanson's anytime ... ONE out of TEN.
