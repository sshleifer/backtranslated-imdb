I'm totally into this type of story line, but when the movie was fired, I honestly said, "I just rented a two-dollar budget Christian POS". The only thing I liked about this movie was that it has a descent history, but it was terribly executed. Terrible actors, horrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and the manufacturer have to look at the dice before trying to draw a movie in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that kept you fascinated at the point you didn't notice that you were in the same room the whole movie. Terrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eyes, and one could tell that the director expects to keep your attention. But these two and their bios can talk to this, are horrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Don't rent this. Unless you are blind because it can get up few stars if you only listen to it.
