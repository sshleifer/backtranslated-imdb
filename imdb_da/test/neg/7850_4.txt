The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film co-starred by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson at MGM. The first two were Anchor Aweigh and it happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra, Grayson wooed and lost. I think the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For romance maybe, but definitely not for screenshot. Sinatra in his eighties movie again plays the cozy little schnook only this time in toreador pants. Poaching on Tyrone Power's territory pronounced in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotelier during the day and The Kissing Bandit at night. He's gone and left California for a training and has come back ready to take Dad's place but only in the hotel business. And where he teaches the hotel industry, Boston. <br /> <br /> Of course, some father's former gang members grew a bit old and paunchy led by J. Carrol Naish that he was going to lead the band again. But Frank is just not cut off for the life of peace. But he makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. Anyone should have had it to Sinatra at the MGM to throw him into this after the bad reviews he got in the Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But as this was a musical, I suppose the brain confidence in the MGM was depicted as Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing co-star. In fact, the best number in the movie is for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse make a dance special that is nice. Frank songs are cozy, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In recent years, Sinatra would win with the mention of The Kissing Bandit and for good reason.
