The only good part of this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. No no it can be a bit hard - the dance in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately it is where the plot ended. As long as the casting danced and did not speak, the film went well together. As for Chayanne's debut - not so bad, but hopefully his next movie will have a little depth. As for watching the movie wait for rental or TV. Don't make the same mistake I made and pay 8.50
