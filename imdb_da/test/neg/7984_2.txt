Oh my God, I was expecting something more entertaining than this when I downloaded this movie, as 1903 was one of my favorite years of film, but it sucked! The "reason", though I hesitate to call it, is about a stupid elephant. It slowly makes its way onto a platform and becomes electrolysed to death. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is like the worst director ever. Plus, the elephant has no screen presence at all. And the end? Wow, that was not at all predictable. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Image quality is also terrible. You can hardly tell what happens most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un-scary horror flicks this did not spell eleven successors. Except that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute in your life, you will never come back.
