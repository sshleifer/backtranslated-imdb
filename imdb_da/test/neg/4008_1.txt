Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day at Athens streets, a movie director encountered a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because ... you know ... he's deprived ... and he takes a lot of his shirt and so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynistic ... but of course filled with beautiful guys with their coffins showing. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, enjoy it if you don't avoid it like the plague. It's got me off to go to Greece, that's for sure.
