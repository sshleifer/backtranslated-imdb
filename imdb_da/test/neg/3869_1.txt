"You know - I've been in some cities where the girls weren't so beautiful. In fact, I've been in some cities where they're pretty ugly. But this is the first time I've been in a city where there are no girls in general. "I'm sure fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the really amazing seven (from the first movie) ... Now I want to mention him here. You know - I've seen some movies where the plot is not so good. In fact, I have seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but it is the first time in my life that I saw the movie where there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Perhaps my aforementioned statement is just over the top, but honestly ... how to call the plot a crap that goes on in this movie. The bad guy (oh, don't ask me to give you his name because I can't remember, and he's not even close to Calvera whose name and character is unforgettable ...) trying to build the church in the name of his late sons killed in a fight and this bad guy kidnap poor villagers to force them to build the church ... first and foremost, how big the church has to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... are there some Egyptian pyramids or something? but ok, let's stop here about a bad guy's plot and absolutely forgettable character, and let's say few words about The Seven itself ... Yul brynner is good old Chris, always calm, always quiet, talking less but speaking wisely is away (unfortunately). Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now he's calm so fake that you just don't buy it. (Imagine he meets a good old friend Chico, whom he must save after so many years, and there are just a few "hi, hey" and not even handshakes (as far as I remember)) ... honestly see it more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat, rather than meeting Chris and Chico. That means "new Chris" looks more like robocop or terminator rather than our beloved clever hurtgun ... <br /> <br /> I don't want to stop here and talk about other characters. There is simply nothing ... (Imagine if strong actor like Yul Brynner is so much false forgettable, so what will other characters look like) ... There are still some attempts to give us a background story for each one them ... for example, is a female favorite guy, the other is a man of dark past whose wife was raped and killed by the Indians, and he then kills everyone and everything that moves ... but not of those characters has Some sense or not of them can take your heart. I remember being a young child and when O'reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie I was crying. Here I just didn't care about each one of them ... Even though all of them with the whole crew in the movie would die, it seems that I don't care more ... <br /> <br /> So please , go see this movie ... I recommend it because you don't have the second chance to see anything worse than that.
