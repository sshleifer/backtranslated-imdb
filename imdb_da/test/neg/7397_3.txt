This is one of those movies with great potential. Brilliant actors, a debut from a very interesting instructor and a joking "Survivor" plot. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> To start with the good: The camera is great. The beauty of the Namibian desert appears as a merciless environment, also in the pictures. And then there is the actor. Perfectly okay. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> So the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why on earth does Levring choose "Lear" for their game? The whole idea of ​​letting Shakespeare articulate their despair and inner longings does not work. It seems like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies take place because of the choice of "Lear". They just have to fit in the Script of Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And sexy. It takes about three days, so more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easy way out when you need a plot in a plot. Janet McTeer's part is completely different, mainly because of the ridiculous idea. The sex makes the plot fall quickly to the ground. Instead, they could have focused on the dialogue. There must have been conversation between all the characters, but we mainly see them in smaller groups. However, their speech is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The King Is Alive" is still not the worst Danish dogma'95 movie yet. But comparing it to the latest of the homemade dogma'95 films "Italian for Beginners" by Lone Scherfig, it doesn't fail badly. It's not a good movie. It's a bad one. But it's beautiful.
