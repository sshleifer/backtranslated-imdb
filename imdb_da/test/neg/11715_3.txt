A few friends and I visited the video store a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy not seen flicks. My friend grabbed the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well it scared us and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrassed throughout my life. We came home and put it on, and we rolled about the floor laughing about 45 min. Because it was the funniest movie in the world. I can't remember much about it, but one thing I remember was that the blonde girl got it on with a guy at the back of a store every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh, and when I look at other people's comments on this movie I get to laugh even more. The head of the family is so good and the head is fun and I still laugh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
