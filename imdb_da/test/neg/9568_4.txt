Before I begin, let me get something from my chest: I'm a big fan of John Eyres first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The movie, a B-class cross of both TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, cannot be a cinematic genius, but is a very entertaining action movie that became a cult line (and created two successors and a spin off). <Judge and jury begins with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row after his capture of the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (which acts as a bad name for a killer? Meeker kills three people while attempting to rob a grocery store) which is transported to the electric chair. There is an entertaining scene where Meeker speaks to the pastor about living for sex, but fulfills her one true love (which was killed during the shootout) and expressed her revenge against the person who killed her ?? Michael Silvano, a rinsed soccer star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school (and ending up harassing his son's trainer). But once executed, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without fries") whose sole purpose is to avenge himself, which basically means making Silvano's life miserable. <br /> <br /> Let me point out that judge and jury are not a true horror movie. It's a supernatural action movie in which Meeker chases Silvano and uses his ability to change shape (similar to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his mustache) , a dragon queen, a clown and a stand-up comedian), a shotgun who burns explosive rounds and a defeat to death (though it does not stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a desert eagle), to pay Silvano back to kill Meeker's wife. br /> <br /> Director John Eyres doesn't seem interested in characterizations, but focuses exclusively on action scenes that the movie has lots of. But it is the movie's biggest mistake, as there is nothing to link the action scenes together. The action is surprisingly good, with Keith delivering the best performance, supported by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the washed policeman quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie is trying to help but makes the situation worse.
