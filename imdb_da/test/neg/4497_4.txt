The photography is accomplished, the action is quite good, but in almost all other departments, the Greek tycoon is a boring drill. With inspiration from Jackie Kennedy's true love affair and Aristotle's Onassis, the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on television all day long. Viewers embracing the whole "celebrity magazine culture" (paparazzi photographs and gossip stories of the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much to make their appetite here. But those who prefer movies with a little more fabric and craftsmanship and quirkiness will find the 107 minute run time that is a shocking hit. <br /> <br /> US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) are in Greece on official business. A ridiculously wealthy Greek shipping tycoon, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), views Liz at a party at his elegant manor. Although both are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis makes his wishes to Liz. Sometimes later, President Cassidy is murdered as he walks on a beach. Liz is shocked and sad by her death, but it is not long before she seeks comfort in her Greek lover Tomasis's arms. Finally, two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favorite speech point for world newspapers, magazines, photographers and guards. It is a little entertaining to note the strength that the producers of this film refused to be a dramatization of the Kennedy-Onassis story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story, anchored in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the film draws its inspiration. Even Aristotle's Onassis himself knew that the Greek tycoon constituted his love life to get the Hollywood treatment (whose rumors must be believed, he actually had a hand in approval of Anthony Quinn for the Tomasis role!) J. Lee-Thompson is not really the right one kind of instructor for this type of movie ?? he is better suited to action foot like The Guns Of Navarone and ice cold in Alex ?? but he strengthens the matter with an uninspired, academic adequacy. Quinn is very visible as Tomasis; The bite looks nice as his wish object; Francis uses his toothy smile and a facade of integrity to make a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there is little for the actors to do at a deeper level. Similarly, Tony Richmond's photography film gives an elegant surface shine as it moves from an exotic location to the next, but most of the scratches prove that there is nothing behind the film's smooth exterior.
