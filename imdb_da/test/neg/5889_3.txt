Having been born and raised in Odessa and I graduated from "Second" High School in the late 70s, Odessa High School, I had mixed feelings about this movie. I no longer live in Odessa, but will always be a Texan in heart. I didn't like the way that this 80,000 plus city was portrayed as a poor little town. If I am mistaken, please feel free to correct me, but I think OHS also plays in the city stadium, and the sign "Home of the Permian Panthers" shown at the stadium was in practice at Perm. I would like to have seen a little recognition of the great city rivalry of the big game in town every year, OHS vs. Permian. I am curious why the outcome of the game was changed, but I think it would have been as dramatic if the real result was portrayed. Overall, the film was okay, got me a little homeward, remember MOJO's "good old days".
