I'm usually a very generous voter on IMDb and don't bother commenting on movies I didn't like, but it was just lame. I actually hit it 15 minutes before I finished it, to see "This Is It" (because my gf wanted ... I just picked the least of two bad guys). <br /> <br /> To watch this movie: picture this movie as a collection of worse than average "horror" stories, such as "scary short stories" that you find in a question about "Reader's Digest" in dental waiting room. <br /> I didn't expect anything particularly scary or fun, I'm not "I want to see blood!" - The type of person, but this "movie" is neither "horror" or "comedy" or entertaining in any other way. Seeing the movie on "You Got Got" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea is probably more scary / fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7.
