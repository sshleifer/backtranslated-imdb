I like to believe I've seen it all. SS DOOMTROOPER. The one about a family of sabertooth tigers. The one about a family of pteranodones. HAT EAT. DEMON CHILD (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horn glued to the head. More SASQUATCH flicks, none of them good.) A few giant spiders / insect flaps. Endless HELLRAISER sequel. Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels. Endless JASON sequels. A kickboxing scarecrow. 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $ 199 camcorder etc. I saw part of an STV the second night about people stranded on a desert island of kickboxing to death with a group of badly animated totems. have even been through DREAMCATCHER, just as recently as last night - well, I had to say that I was sitting through parts of it and seen it in all its terrible glory many years ago. But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, if a group of youths caught on an island during a storm, forced to fight with foreigners arriving at a meteorite. The meteorite looks like it came out of a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s, so foreigners do it. And writing is all just as bad. I hit it halfway through. Good luck.
