Bloody horrible! There is just no other way to put it on. In fact, it is ** SO ** bad that the only reason I waste words about this is to warn other reasonable viewers who want to be intelligently entertained. You will lose I.Q. points look at this. Come to think of it, it's not even suitable for mindless viewing because of the irritant factor. There is no fault in looking at something that is incompetent. Reason for avoiding it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where this is no sci-fi anymore, it's just mindembingly sloppy, lazy fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) The sport FX that is cheesy without faith. Not even a cheesy kitsch, a look and a nod, like vintage Doctor Who, but just cheap and unclear to be insulting. FX is so bad that they aren't even ridiculous. They spent about fifty dollars on this, no more. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and thoughtless that the only way players could make it through to the end of shooting without being terminally depressed was to sleepwalk through their roles, even though Catherine McCormack did some effort anyway, probably in principle and despite the director. Moreover, this is not Peter Hyam's only bad movie: his flubs reach far more than they hardly save, of which Timecop was the last one, and it was 15 years before this writing. He has nothing half decent since (End of Days was just as slapdash, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed much firmer direction than Hyams provided). Hyams makes it all the more meaningless for anyone to consider giving him more work. And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) Ray Bradbury's stories deserve far better treatment than this. Refusing to watch this movie sends the message, not that Hollywood listens specifically. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. If you do that and it completely turns off movies, you only blame yourself (and Hyam's) because you have been more than adequately warned.
