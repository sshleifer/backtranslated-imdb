Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... and what about some of the stiffest, most unnatural, incredible and campaigning ideas you can imagine? What about stereotypical "signs", situations and places? Or how about a manipulative, cloying, utterly miserable script? I can't think of an element in this movie that was original, worthy of seeing or interesting. Note to all of you Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, folks, because they won't be famous much longer ...
