A cheap and cheerless hoist movie with poor characterization, lots of underbite style stoic emotion (think Chow Yun Fat in a better morning) and some cheesy cliches thrown into an abandoned factory ready for some poorly executed flying judo rolls on John Woo. Even the squibs look awful. At some point in the case, it doesn't look like America. Three wonky old cars do not make any land. The Mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. The reason, as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the end is like a murder. It couldn't come soon enough. Even the jewelry from the robbery resembles the cheapest junk costume jewelry available. The dreadful dialogue and hopeless overactivation of everyone being shot goes beyond a real waste of space and time. Worth to see if you want to know how to make a low-budget movie clich√©.
