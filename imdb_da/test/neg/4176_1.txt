This movie was horrible ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe that didn't show up in this movie. The beginning was a shake of random scenes, most of which had nothing to do with the film, except that they show that the man is psychic ... but not too good ... After the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour with only the man character looking for his daughters. It becomes vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before. But that's the extent of it. <br /> <br /> And why can I ask, was this movie rated R? There were two drops of blood and 4 curse words. And how on earth did it come into a video store ?? This movie was badly acted, badly recorded, poorly written and generally terribly executed.
