May be the worst movie ever made. At least plan 9 From the outer space was fun. I can't believe they talked to anyone about actually putting money into doing this thing. Complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this shot, I had some respect for Kristophersson. I guess someone needed a tax write-off. Please, in the name of all that doesn't suck, stop the one who did this before sucking again! This movie should be avoided by all people who are not on LSD or my crazy cousin who insists that we are a lot of Indians. If you are in the woods and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. There is no need to make a movie about it.
