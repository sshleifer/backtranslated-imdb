Oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth movie. Coming within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you think people would be burned out on this concept. Apparently not since I rented it and hoped it couldn't be terrible: Dennis Hopper was in it, and he's a good actor, right? I forgot something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and a lot of other valued actors, Hopper has a penchant for coming up with horrible movies. Not only that, but he seems to be preparing for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. His performance in Tychus is so awful that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't know what to say more about this rubbish than if you're in the stuff crashing into the Earth movies, see Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys on a stretch. Forget the others completely. This is really the bottom of the pile.
