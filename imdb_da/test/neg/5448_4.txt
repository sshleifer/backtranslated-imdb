It's hard to know if this skin-brain B movie adventure is a spoof, a tribute or simply bungled, but it doesn't work no matter how you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's so-called novel, it is a nutty mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naff visual effects and corny dialogue. The first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and it is obviously not better to get the movie from that time. Worth doing all this old rope is Tim Curry, turning in a feverish slice of ham and cultivating a bizarre accent that tolerates identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that this is a lot of old waste.
