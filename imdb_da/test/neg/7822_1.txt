I have never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. It's a movie about stupid people who do stupid and horrible things. This is not a funny movie. I have to say that the line is horrible. I didn't have the patience to see it, so I only saw half that, but that was enough for me. The characters are not much inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is about a goofy guy trying to connect his tyrant's bosss daughter. When he finally talks to her, she asks him at night to visit her home to see her father's owl, and he thinks she has invited him to go with her to a party and stay with her at home at noon. He is very disappointed to find out that he only needs to care for the owl and that she has a girlfriend. After her father leaves home with precise orders, to take care of the house and his beloved bird, a secretary, a dismissed son appears, and all sorts of fun things do not happen in the house. But he finally joins his boss's daughter. TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL !!!!!!!!!!!!
