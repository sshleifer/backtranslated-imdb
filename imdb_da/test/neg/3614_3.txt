A large selection of snakes arise a riot on tourists "invading" their island because of their captain's ship damage. The few remaining survivors who are not trapped by the snakes will attempt an escape mission, their goal of fleeing to available boats, which can get them safely off the island. <br /> <br /> Presented against injected doses of visual humor with many snake gags, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND has many different breeds of slithery predators in striking position, ready to attack their prey. Star William Katt, as a writer researching snakes for an upcoming novel, has fun in his role along with author / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (... as a tourist boat captain) who put-on heroes staring at serious crisis. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, a vacation lawyer. The other cast members serve as tourists or crew, mainly feed for the snakes. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, instructor Crawford has live snakes with computer generated, and the violence is really tame. Crawford even incorporates the point of view with the camera as the snake's eyes as it faces the potential victim (with the actor looking directly into the camera). Never to be taken seriously, the tongue-in-kind approach was probably the best way to shoot at SNAKE ISLAND, because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on its own. The effects and voltage scenes rarely work because Crawford is often unable to successfully place the sequences where people face the snakes. The snake never attacks itself on the screen (.. one or two peaks), or is so glued presented, they leave a little impression. It's a no-no for a genre like this one. Fans of Katt will probably want to check it out because he gives some face comedies that establish the general tone of certain scenes where he has to defend himself against the snakes. The CGI scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area are not very effective, removing the realism that Crawford may have tried to establish. There are lots of better horror movies with snakes like aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, referred to a scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day with the bubble, not knowing what danger lies ahead.
