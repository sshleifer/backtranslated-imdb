After reading many good things about it, I finally looked at "clearing". With a game of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, at least one would expect a decent movie. After the final credits were rolled, I was still shocked at how bad and incoherent this movie was. <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be an "art" movie? I don't think because it's too melodramatic for it. The bad thing is that the drama seems all too compulsory and unrealistic. The probability is that the script does not make sense at all. First of all, it never explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters, it just remains their so-called "personal problems." What is so bad about Redford's character that he has to "clean it"? That he cheats, occasionally his wife? The guy is a millionaire who has had a good life, has a great son and a big daughter, a wife who loves him (and a boyfriend who also seems to be far above the generic mistress type of woman) o and a newborn grandchild. The only problem seems to be that he ... has worked hard for his entire life to be a successful person. So what? It seems that his hard work has really paid off and in fact there are no real problems with his life. /> <br /> Then we come to Dafoe's character: here is someone who was the head of one of Redford's companies and was fired. Why is this guy available for ... eight years ??? It seems that he needs some kind of good education to get a job like what he had in the first place and seems to have been a man of solid ideas about his work (as evidenced by his feedback from a conversation he had with Redford when he worked for him) Why couldn't a man do such a decent job and have a decent life? Because he was once fired? Totally unrealistic. The film really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something, and it comes out as real cheeses. In fact, if the creators of this movie tried to say something about the American dream, they would fail miserably. <br /> <br /> Regarding the actual events taking place during the film, they also make no sense. In fact, the last 20 minutes of the movie come as an insult to the viewer's intelligence, because there is not one thing that actually makes sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 chances to escape, but he doesn't. For a moment he is ready to escape, yet he misses his chance that he will feel sorry for his kidnappers and will not hurt him !!! Dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mud, which should be useless (if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it might blow into your face) and the gun is in perfect condition !!! The way an unemployed, useless (as portrayed in this movie) and mentally unstable character manages to infect the entire FBI with such ease brings the narrative of this movie to "twilight zone" levels. The osteopic end (with Redford's wife's illusion) comes to end the viewer. <br /> <br /> This movie pretends to be something it is not (ie a quality, sophisticated psychological thriller). Unfortunately, it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that is the word that describes this movie best: a disaster
