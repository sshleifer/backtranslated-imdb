First I have to say that I have read all about this subject and I know it inside and I was thrilled to finally see it too. But you only have to read the book, this mini-series is based on, to realize that it is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is loosely based on facts, the rest is taken from the scriptwriter's imagination. And, unfortunately, these changes are anything but successful and mostly unnecessary. Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka before their affair began, and during that Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The seduction stage when their affair started Violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could continue, these examples were all included when the series was first started. In addition to all these changes from the facts, the characterization is also all wrong. At times, Vita behaves like a sour woman. Especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper Violets engagement announcement is just ridiculous. Vita held her flood of emotions inside. It was Violet who was temperamental and showed his feelings (good or bad). All Vita did when she read it was that she almost fainted, that was all. Harold avoided real-life confrontations, but here he is sometimes quite right and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know that this series intentionally focused on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters should be mere dolls on the sidelines. Here she is completely one-dimensional in nature, and the lines given to her are mostly embarrassingly low. In fact, she was intelligent, gifted, an extraordinary woman who rarely got the credit she deserves. I've always thought of her much more interesting person than Vita. In this series, her dissatisfaction, loneliness and her problems with her mother are completely ignored. Viewer also has some clues on her background and family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she fought over Vita. Vita was the only love in her life, her raison d'etre, and if Harold suffered, it also made Violet. Then her life was in ruins, and it took time to retire. Statue could have acted as Deny's role, the depth his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exuberant French accent. The series ends with the completely poorly written scene in Amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to scriptwriter. No, it continued a whole year after that, and it ended up much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. But what do you worry about the stupid end if the whole series has been stupid from the start. I have to give a bit of credit to actors, they tried to make the most of the roles given to them, even though Janet McTeer, since Vita is the only one who really shines through. You can't complain about the settings either. All complaints go to the director and most of all, the scriptwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. Many of the scenes are too long, some are meaningless and do not bring anything to the story. On the other hand, many details are abbreviated or omitted altogether. In particular, there should have been more information on the Vita and Violets youth and how their friendship developed. This is a fascinating story that would have earned a much better fit. Maybe someday somebody will do it. Currently, you can do much more of this story by reading the actual book or Violet's letters to Vita, which are brilliant things.
