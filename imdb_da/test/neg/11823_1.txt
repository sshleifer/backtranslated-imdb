This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Writing and action is just pathetic. It is right up there with Uncle Sam on all the worst movies ever made. But when I look bad like this one who can make it video, it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making movies because I know I could do a better job than what the creators of Killers did.
