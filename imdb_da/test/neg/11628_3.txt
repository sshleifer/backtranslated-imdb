Jack Higgins' healthy thriller about a guilty IRA bombs forced "a last job" (where have I heard that plot before?) Gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, admits everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally experienced the shooting. Church rules keep Father Bob from speaking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the pastor's blind niece. They bind in the cemetery. What? Really, it's the plot. Alan Bates is around as the top dog fighter who calls the shoots (literally) and he seems to be the only actor on the sharp note that Hodges is aiming for. Bates are all set to do some kind of U.K. PRIZZI'S HONOR, but no one else, including an effortless charismatic Liam Neeson in a supporting role, has been informed.
