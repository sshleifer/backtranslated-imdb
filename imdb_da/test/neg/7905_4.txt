This movie was not for fun. It wasn't terrible either. Just a fun trip aboard the Soul Plane. It is a black-owned flight service with a kick-ass disco, beautiful bar and pump managers. The ground takes you through the whole idea of ​​a variety (not race or color, but 'style') plan with the same style as black humor. At times, there are some beautiful rare scenes that when the protagonist uses the normal toilet in the normal plane. Check it out. However, there are lulls, and I find most of the character that played Soul Pilot. Look to find out who it is. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold adds the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is a movie to watch when you play poker when you are full, or just weights.
