Yes, we all know about Dan Schneider's strange little fascination with making shows with young children and iCarly is no exception. Watch young girls wiggle their toes and hold their tongue off the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikini. Yes, it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd. In any way, the show is not so good compared to Dan Schneider's other shows as the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone and have to walk alone while their father is off in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has a medieval exciting friend named Sam, and they make a very well-produced, award-winning web show called iCarly with their little school friends Freddie. The episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx in school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young, eleven web personality / businesswoman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who trusts to speak very very loudly and quickly to get her pointing and odd faces. Her brother Spencer is a somewhat medieval, obscure and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor who tries a little too hard to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who would like to type Joey Gladstone humor. Then there is Sam Puckett, an unlikely, meaningless little, lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly wears hair extensions that you can see them disappear, then reappearing from stage to stage. And finally there is Freddie Benson on the web, showing nerdy cameraman and technical advisor who has a big crush on Carly, but will of course come nowhere with her, which is played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go as Freddie's mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers, and many of their annoying little school friends to round out. Most of the comedies are medieval, such as blowing up Lewbert the Doorman as a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking on the table of young girl scouts selling cookies. All adults come out as complete idiots, while the children all know, and some protagonists have absolutely no morals. Lying, cheating, stealing and violence are all acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, yes ... it's a children's show! What more can the young viewers ask for? Well with Dan Schneider, we can expect the young girls to dress in tight clothes and bikini and do some odd things like holding their tongue out to the camera and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> Shows like this are just what the young crowd likes, and I don't think any worse than any of the other trash bins by their young crowd. There are always fans to find something on TV, at least this is a bit better, as most of the things seen on Nick as the awful Naked Brothers show.
