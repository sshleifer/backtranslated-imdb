If this movie was just monstrous, poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no leadership at all, and all the issues raised fail to find answers. All in all, the movie is extremely repetitive and boring (I've been in war-torn African countries several times and found all the hibernation of local misery and hopelessness very painful to see but still has no meaning). <br /> <br /> Asked questions are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are not issues but statements. <br /> <br /> - I'm not a doc movie creator, but what is the purpose of traveling for example. The question of arms trafficking, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director didn't even want to show us at least one order where he would wait near the airport, trying to track heavily loaded trucks leaving the area just after a plane landed. <br /> <br /> - Fish history records less than 5 mn and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary film shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all ???? <br /> <br /> - Abject poverty is constantly showing up in endless sequences, but where is the point? You can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand camera and unfortunately shoot the same pictures. Where are the big news? <br /> <br /> Filming prostitutes watching and crying over images of their murdered friend and co-prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulation you can see these days on thrash and real TV. <br /> <br /> - The parallel between famine destructive land with over two million hunger and fish exports is absolutely pointless, dishonest and meaningless, but manipulating viewers in typical anti-globalization and anti-Western feelings. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academician has published a very detailed commentary on the film that brought the number of journalists working in Africa for decades to explore a little more about more detail. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The fish waste dried in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all intended to be eaten by humans, but is collected to be exported to reasonably good money for animal feed purposes. I don't think I'm the only one who's got the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. Arm smuggling is a reality (but again, where are the big news ??), but not the way this film explains the problem. If the empty aircraft landing in Mwanza participate in smuggling, they actually relinquish their shipment at another location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish so as not to empty the trip back (meaning they actually land empty) in Mwanza ...). People eat fish locally, unlike what the film suggests (about 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people live with it. Good for them! It is a private company of the kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not Western moans and endless foreign aid. I can't tell how shocked I see the success of this movie!
