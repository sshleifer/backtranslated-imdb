I loved all the dogs go so much in the sky that I went to see the sequel in the theater and I can't remember being more disappointed with a movie. The story stinks worse than an assault manure. I mean, come on! How could Carface possibly imagine being able to avenge himself on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. Plus, does Satan portray as a cat?!?! How do you get clich√©? So much for the story. Is it weird that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot coil? The animation was absolutely miserable. The colors were all washed out, and I can't count how many times I could see through objects that should be solid. It had to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies but not this BOMB!
