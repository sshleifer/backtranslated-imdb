A weird, intentionally skewed biopic by Dyan Thomas, where we hear a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure a raw character exposed seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repugnant self-interest, and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistent tense pledge. The movie never seems to determine where it is going. There is no bow as much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!) Than in the man who brings them together and then shares them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley better at best, but I never found her sympathetic), but they both offer terribly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other fun decisions include too much William (Murphy), arty production (eg, double crossing), which is neither impressionistic nor symbolic, and the old chestnut act of period photography that does not mix. 4.10
