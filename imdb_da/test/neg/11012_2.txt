Ants appear in cartoons such as being able to carry chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This can be an admirable characteristic character because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a narrator who cryptically explains that some cosmic events have come to the ground and that a co-op has worked on the effects of this disturbance on the swamp population. The film is divided into segments; The first part after the cosmic event is Phase I and so on to the end of the film, which is Phase IV. What is Phase IV? Who knows? We can't see that part; Presumably, it has something to do with the binding of one of the researchers studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler is angry with the ants because they killed the horse, but apart from an angry outbreak, you go around the biodom with a blank ("Clueless"?) Look. /> <br /> These ants are pretty smart; or the researchers are pretty stupid. I give credit to the ants. Why? Everything that normally destroys my picnics, which can then build reflective towers, burst trucks and adapt to poison with the greatest ease, makes my voice the most clever kind, at least in this movie. Sterno says stomp on this anthill. <br /> <br />
