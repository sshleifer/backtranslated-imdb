Yes, I spelled it right. This movie is so predictable that the real word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the main characters and situation are introduced, it is the color measure of where this plot will take us. The shear was as subtle as a two-ton sledge hammer. You could take many pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play at the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in incredible roles and Abigail Breslin played the sweet role admirably. It's just that the movie brought nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was weak and the laughs were weak and few. Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to see, but you won't miss out on missing this one.
