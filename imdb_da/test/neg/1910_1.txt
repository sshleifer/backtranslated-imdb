I was eagerly waiting to see this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was it quarter-way?) Because of the poor script and directing. Not to mention the poor caste! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can trade, and he is much more suited to being the hero of history. <br /> <br /> Now, story is just a loose girl from the country who cheated on her long-time decent girlfriend just to have pointless sex with a spoiled rich brat. This movie failed to draw my sympathy, not even when the author intended. I wonder where the moral values ​​go? The actors are so stiff that when I resume the movie (a few weeks after it was interrupted because of its dull character), they still failed to alert me. The spoiled couple can only wake me up! Which movie! <br /> <br /> I think that all the people involved in this production should sit down and review it together so they won't make the same mistakes next time. And next time they can consider Josh Hartnett as the main character ...
