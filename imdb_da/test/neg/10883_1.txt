Seriously people ... I was ready to really write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got to IMDb.com and realized that its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. Seriously, this movie could have easily been a Razzie Champ. This movie sucked! How in the world this piece of shit was overlooked, although a 2006 Razzie nomination is beyond me because it could easily have competed with it basically, it sucks for the 2006 Razzie Championship. I rented this movie on the recommendation of my female neighbor who told me, "Oh my God, after watching this movie, it will be a long time before I ever stop to rest again!" I couldn't believe how not scary and horrible this movie was! Possible spoiler underneath, not that you will miss anything. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops itself. Of course, the director of this piece of crap does not know the first thing about women. The restrooms in the rest stop were at the same level as in the film Trainspotting. I do not claim to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing I know is that women are mostly total and complete hygiene / nice freaks. Considering the choice of taking a crap on one of these toilets and possibly catching something or chopping in the woods, a woman chooses to chop in the woods. I know because I have been camping with them before, and they have no problem chopping in the woods. So right there ... big plot hole and falsehood. First of all ... she comes out of the rest stop, and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, neither does he rather his car. He just left. She starts screaming her name and wondering where he is. Ummm ... hey? You stand on wet mud ... has it ever been for you to look down for some tire tracks? I mean, his car is gone ... it just didn't come up and fly away. And actually it makes me think ... I actually looked down at her feet, and there were no tread marks in the mud. How ... exactly ... did it? <br /> <br /> Third ... The Bible dumped mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking Polaroid pictures ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made no sense at all, and it is as if the director just threw them in to be weird to be weird. They had no sense at all, nor did they have room to be in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh My God, this ... I mean finally ... near the end of the movie. .. she finally sees the escape hatch in the ceiling inside the rest stop. I'm like, "You ... stupid ... in ** h. You've been unlocked in this rest stop for this whole time ... and you just ... now ... see ... the escape hatch in the attic? "I mean ... it's as if they threw it in just because the killer threw gasoline on the floor through the window and was ready to turn on a fight. So she needs to get to the higher ground to avoid being burned, and ... oh, look! A perfect reason for her to come to the higher ground! An escape hatch in the attic! It's like ... Why didn't she go through it before? Most people in that situation would have seen it from the moment they were locked in the rest and got out of Dodge. When they showed the air at the end of the movie, I was like, "You must fool me." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what did all the people she encountered continue to disappear? The girl in the costume in the rest clogged? The stupid policeman? Her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the cupboard herself? It was never explained. Personally, when they did, I thought of myself, "Oh, Christ on a cracker, it's her. She's the killer. Wonderful. She killed all these people, doesn't remember doing it, and the authors of this movie just ripped of a particular French horror flick, which I can't mention on IMDb.com, or I'm blacklisted to renounce the end (that movie also sucked people down). "But it wasn't. She was not the killer, and the whole deal with the dead people disappeared, was never ever explained. Oh, for God's love, people, stay away from this movie! This movie sucked balls and I have now got a serious bone to choose with my neighbor. It's on 2 for $ 1 rack on Family Video, don't even rent it if anyone gives it for you for free!
