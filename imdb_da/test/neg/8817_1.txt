(This review is not necessarily subject to the movie's plot, but it can change its expectations of the movie and thus make a less enjoyable experience.) <br /> <br /> Completely rented a scary movie that was waiting to be on the edge of Your seat in fear, and instead ended up crying in laughter at every stupid turn of the plot? This film had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut badly and jumped too much; References to the past seem more like excuses for why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The authors must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been done because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraged by the viewer and makes the movie more and more tiring. Almost worse than the authors have abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was that it was gradually dependent on cheap tactics for a scare. The actor did not make it scary, and the situations did not make it scary, so it needed a few dark scenes with things that jumped out on you to make it worthwhile. Even they were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even Gore could have saved the plot and it rivals Gore from the successful thriller Se7. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the Se7, I feel like Saw tried to follow the Se7's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed badly. I was terribly disappointed with the lack of analysis and plot structure about the killer's psychology. Beginning scenes tease the viewer to believe that this is a psychological thriller; Believe me, it is far from it. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention bad deals? First, Cary Elwes seems to make a convincing performance; This, however, completely deteriorates in the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in the laughter's tears on this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also horrible and too played, although it is not as bad as Elwe's performance, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also the author of the film. <br /> <br /> Saw's end could never make up for losing the whole center of it, and that's what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity that was wasted and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie. I'm angry with myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth $ 4, and in the future I would definitely avoid seeing anything that has to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked the basis for its plot, that is, the great potential story was thrown away, and bad action added insult to injury. I avoid the poor sayings that involve the title and just conclude this: Don't watch the movie.
