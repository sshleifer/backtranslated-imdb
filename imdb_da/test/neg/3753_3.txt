Let's look at it, it's a pretty bad movie. But if you go ready to make fun, you can survive the experience. Okay, you will scare a lot in evil. The old jungle is fun in a drowsy way. <Tom Conway (who uses most of the movie wearing a funky chapeau) uses the local witch doctor and crazy science to create a "perfect" being. It looks like a warmth that has been in six weeks full and is in a sack dress. That is just fine. But it won't kill him because he uses a good girl as his subject. He needs a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two small bows in search of African gold. Living in English should have been at the top of the search list. She is a poor girl and lets everyone know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play. "Connors is the white guide English & Fuller con to lead the expedition. <br /> <br /> English & Conway finally meet, and it's a fight made in hell. She's the perfect subject for b exterminating his voodoo creature, because she wants to do something (stress something) to get what she wants, you will do something to stop the pain in this movie at this time. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting to me was Conway wearing Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was, well, he thought that if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes, no one could recognize him. /> Really bad cinema.
