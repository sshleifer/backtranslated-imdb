Maybe it's time we declared 2007 to be "The International Year of Cinematic Crocodile"! The ridiculous "Primeval" came first about a hook called Gustave (!), Who controlled the swamps in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a low profile and made for TV sequel to a forgettable original. Third, there is this incredibly derived and soporific piece of Aussie horror, and finally I have not yet seen the promising "Rogue". The latter is probably the best, considering the involvement of the upcoming Aussie horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another rather meaningless survival flip that confuses horror horror. Excuse my bluntness, especially because I honestly speak for the people who went through this ordeal, but portraying three signs sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of ​​pure excitement! Three young people travel through Northern Australia and decide to spend a fishing day in the remote marshlands. It doesn't take too long before a giant and giant crocodile capsule their little boat and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam almost can't escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing a tree. Although he remains invisible for the most part, the hook is patiently waiting and making it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it sounds a horrible mass like the plot "Open Water" actually. Replace the many invisible sharks with a huge invisible crocodile and the open sea with an equally inevitable Aussie swamp and you have it. Oh yes, "Black Water" has at least some rare moments of excitement and an impressively designed water sample. It must be said, the hooks look fabulously groovy and you talk anxiously down to each next time he comes out of the water. The three-headed throw does everything they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you achieve it by sitting in a tree all the time? The concept based on true events, of course, entails a number of limitations, such as limited images of the amazing movie venues, dialogues and gracious drawing drawings.
