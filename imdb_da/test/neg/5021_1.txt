"Inuyasha" was terrible. This show was incredibly overheated, but it's nothing but a dull mass of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless, the story is boring and endless. I think it could have been something interesting if it has a better writing, but it seems that the authors of the show have several intentions to show Inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and many circles around the same again and again. The script is cheesy and silly and the animation is poor. The character design it's very ugly, I don't know why everyone loves it, everyone has the same face! : Big eyes, small nose, a line like the mouth and the typical anime haircut. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and stupid. This should be one of the most overrated animated shows ever made.
