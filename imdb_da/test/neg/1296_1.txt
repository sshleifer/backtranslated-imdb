I was hit by the horrible spectacle and script for this movie. All the characters seem to be immovable by personal problems - rather than deer in headlamps. They dive around and whine and moan about their feelings when decisive actions are taken. I found myself yelling on the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something! The sermon line is incredible. Every time there is a key decision to be taken by a protagonist, one of the other characters must solve all the problems of the obvious decision as to make the decision more difficult - it is a tried melodramatic trick and just wants to get you to moan. Obviously, importing the decision is obvious - you don't have to treat the audience as idiots. All in all - there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie.
