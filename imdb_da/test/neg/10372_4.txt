I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once got part 5 at VHS 10 years ago and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the fourth because they were shot backwards. but after finally seeing a copy today, I have to say that it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high at first, but it is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie , it's PG-13. The action was not convincing, the story was pretty stupid without excitement, and there weren't many effects. But the biggest problem is that there was no killer or something gore (the annoying child being killed in the car should be the highlight, but come on ..) Surprisingly, both Parts 4 and 5 were directed by the Sequel director Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, though it was nothing but a tribute to the best scenes from any movie. All in all, doll master is much like the Hellraiser series: A great trilogy, but forget the rest ..
