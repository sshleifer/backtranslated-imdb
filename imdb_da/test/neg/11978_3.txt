So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but then it's not many again. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago, even before the game itself was finsished. <br /> <br /> People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far Cry ... This is something Mr Boll has with his legion of Schmucks. Feel loneley on the set invites ball three of his compatriots to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. <br /> <br /> Three names have actually made them quite large in movie biz. So the story goes like this, Jack Carver played To Schweiger (yes Carver is German all shotguns bratwurst eat dudes !!) But I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty bad. People have complained about how he didn't really stay true to the whole Carver agenda, but we only saw carver in a person's perspective so we didn't really know how he looked like when he kicked a **. <br /> <br /> But the story of this movie is beyond denied. We see the evil mad scientist, Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier makes genetically mutated soldiers or GMSs as they are called. Performs his top secret research on an island reminiscent of "SPOILER" Vancouver for some reason. There are no palm trees here. Instead, we got some great rich loggers. We haven't even gone FAR until I started CRY (mehehe) I can't go any further. If you want to be true to Boll's shenanigans then go see this movie, you won't be disappointed, it delivers the true ball experience, which means most will suck. There are some things worth mentioning, which would mean that Boll did a good job in some areas of the movie, such as some fine boats and battle scenes. Until the entire Cromed / Albino GMS team enters the scene and everything makes me laugh. The movie Far Cry series of schizies (it's poop for you simpletons) from a fa if you want to take a wiff further. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick that makes you shoot him the first three minutes he's on the screen.
