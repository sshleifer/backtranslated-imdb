This was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies, and if the actors had been chosen or made to look a bit more like the real people (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son, nor did she die in the street; they brought her on the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I'm not sure of the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a lady in wait would dress up at the Empress and leave her completely naked (and in the 1850s) or that the emperor would announce very proudly "yes I finally make her" to the overall court. As far as I know, it was done immediately on the first night and no one rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker. The sparse grace of the movie is really Stephane Audran, excellent actress and true to nature.
