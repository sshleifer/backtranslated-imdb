This episode has just been sent in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The heavy hands of humor were poorly judged, childish and degraded by what could have been a pretty good story. I can't believe Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place. I've seen every previous episode of this show, and even the episode where Jack played his own elder himself was far ahead of this episode. The lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> There was also no continuity from the previous episode. There was nothing in the story that examined Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug abuse. Nor was there anything explicitly written about Jack's emerging relationship with Ann. Normally, without traces, this kind of continuity is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The next episode will be a significant improvement.
