"Chupacabra Terror" is rescued from a '1' by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a pleasure to see from the front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing as a low budget, aboard the version of THE RELIC John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship to which the monster is being transported. And the very harmless monster is simply a man in a suit. He commits about 100 meaningless At least it is horrific killing, so the body count in this is pretty amazing. Formula, at least. I love the moment Simmon's viciously tells someone what chupacabra stands for: Goat eats! Oooohhh ... scary!
