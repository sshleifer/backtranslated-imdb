I totally agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the focus on the movie is on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not the best, and Spencer Tracy seems to be naive, simple and overly hopeful - both in love and in life; an idealistic role that played best in 'Boys Town'. If you can do it through the ridiculous crowd scene at the train station ... whoa ... it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any cast in the cast. Not the best thing about anyone. Miscast and mismatched. The story is empty, and various and disenfranchised inputs are clear. Hedy Lamarr is her amazing self, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the movie doesn't come out as credible at least for that reason.
