My god ... I haven't seen such a horrible movie for a long time ... long time ... saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... keira knightley really tries really hard in this one, but she can't handle it .. fell her accent every time and didn't have the charisma to fill the role ... sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start asking yourself: Has she ever had plays? judging by the edge of love, has never been in the class, but should consider going in the near future ... they both look really pretty. Maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career .. if they can be actresses everyone can!
