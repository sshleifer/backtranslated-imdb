The "Nature of the Animal" lineup is brilliantly simple and filled with unlimited tension potential: Harried Seller Jack (a very well-known Lance Henriksen) picks up problems in the form of rugs Adrian (Eric Roberts), which seems to possess incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars have been stolen from a casino, and a person named 'Hatchet Man' blows people into the desert. That sounds nice, doesn't it? A kind of "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho." One or both of these men have a secret and nothing is as it seems! Well, author director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder" fame) does not have enough ideas to keep the movie going, the scenario does not excite or thrill (poison for what is probably a "thriller"), and The inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen evokes an unusual, not very earthy Everyman (even sporting an abundant gut), but Roberts is just as threatening and scary as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; We are never sucked into the point where we actually keep track of what is happening and the conclusion slips into the unlikely area (I thought it would be "Fight Club" again, but I was wrong). Too bad. "The nature of the animal" could have been something else ... instead of nothing else.
