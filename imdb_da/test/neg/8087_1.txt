Rare and promising is the moment in filmmaking, when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories exceed their time and strive for the high ranks of a classic and the legends. Throw in the sophisticated skills of an ensemble cast of thespians that are at the very top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where's all originality gone?" It is here like this story, and it is thrown sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most experienced Shakespeare / action / love story-lovers. <br /> <br /> I can't begin to imagine where the authors dreamed of this extraordinary story. Where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? I now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists, giving me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven. <br /> <br /> Like others, I dreamed of greatness. Although I did not write this movie, I saw it, and because of the noble grandeur of this movie, I feel as though I have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that this kind of glory triggers most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach this level of greatness? We will probably be consuming in a white fire of supernova glory as we evolve into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of generous creative power. The most important thing about knowing with your whole heart and the very essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is nothing like what I've talked about. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. It might well ruin our world. Because as some reviewers, a movie on a star system, ie. 1 to 5 stars or even zero stars, I must consider "Tomcats" a black hole. <br /> <br /> I am willing to donate money for a reason that will put an end to these kinds of atrocities that seem to be running late on cash registers. I'm not even negative about the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more of this can we take before foreigners from outer space come down and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, crass, vulgar, imaginative, and degrading films joking out of Hollywood? I won't even dignify this movie by mentioning any name that starred or produced it. I don't even release my time describing the story since we've seen it for a zillion times, and all previous versions were at least once in zen times better. <br /> <br /> That way, my movie was almost imploded under this movie, but with superb selfless effort and very fortunate, I survived to warn the public. You have been warned.
