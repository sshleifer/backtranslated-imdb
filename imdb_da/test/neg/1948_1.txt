It's easy for a movie trying to be exciting to run is just uninteresting. It happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. The scene after stage is tackled to an otherwise exaggerated premise. An uneasy couple picks up only a restless stranger to find more problems. <br /> <br /> Some movies build tensions by building history. Dark Harbor continues to add its history, but never builds on it. I hoped that, like other movies, the excitement would eventually explode. It never does. Also, the characters have no continuity from stage to stage. They can act in a way in a scene, but then act in a completely different way in another scene. In the beginning you think they are only out of character, but in the end you realize that they are not grades at all. They are just props for the final twist. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. In less than ninety minutes, the film still feels too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of the low budget gems. It's more like a fake watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.
