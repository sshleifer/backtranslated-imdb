First, I'm a big fan of crap movies. B class is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately, this movie is simply poor. I dressed like a zombie for a party and my makeup looked better than those in this movie. Especially the big guy in the beginning just looked as if a child had pulled his face with crayons. <br /> <br /> The action is so bad I don't have to comment on why. The effect is also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes that shoot an even blood stream out of the zombies' heads when they are shot. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people comment on this movie trying to increase the rating. No one without their finger in circle would rate this movie over a 5/10. Honestly, it is shameful that people working on this movie increase their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoids this movie, it's not worth wasting those 90 minutes in your life. <br /> Absolutely horrible.
