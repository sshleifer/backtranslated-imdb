Froggie is sorry that he never has a big party like all the other children. Spanky and the gang are trying to remedy it by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all decorations and preparations are for him. Froggy sabotages everything just to find out that the party is for him. <br /> <br /> Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The pieces work, but I don't think it works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where it goes, and since much of the humor needs some sort of surprise that it can work, it all goes down. I think in a strange way that the movie is just a kind of miss. Its the kind of thing they had actually thought about could have been more than a misfire. Worth a try if you lower your expectations
