I have not yet seen the first entry in this series, but fortunately I was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected phrases, and I welcome them for the very original concepts in it. If there is any confusion, let me not doubt that everything I have just said is covered in clean, meticulously cared for sarcasm, the kind that blooms and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick. A clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was guided by a visual effect creating if only other credit in this area is a Henry Rooker movie that was not well received. The actor is at best average, and I am talking to someone not to find ... Scottish computer woman (come seriously, what's with that surname?) Russian accent ridiculous and / or annoying. There is a try or two in styling in this and they are reasonable. The action is not horrible. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is cool enough. Language is rare if even it. Violence is pretty bloody. I recommend this only to fans of B-movies and I would say that you can do worse than this. 1.10
