Cult begins 20 years ago at the Quinling Mountain Range, Southern China, as a guy named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson), finds an old amulet said to have magical powers, cut to California, where Quinlin has created a cult and members act to sacrifice himself when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) folks his evil scheme ... Skip to today as five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex Michaely) & Morgan (Victoria Venegas) are investigating the events twenty years ago that have become known as "Quinling Massacre" for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to kill himself, releasing Owen Quinlin's evil spirit for reasons that are pretty foolish. He sets out to complete what he started all these years ago, claiming souls, so that he can finally inherit the amulet's magical powers for his own evil use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced And directed by Joe Knee, this is not a good movie and it is good with it. The script by Benjamin Oren, which seems to take itself very seriously, is a sour supernatural tale of a cult leader coming back from the dead to finish what he started a few years earlier as you would expect the character involved now has links to what happened all those years ago and it is as boring as it sounds. The character is bland and forgetful, the dialogue as much, there is no proper horror or exploitation in it, it goes slowly at times, it is predictable, it is clich√©, it goes completely away from the rails at the end and does not make much sense when You think about it. History never grabs or engages you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting, and I will struggle to call it average. There is very little here with which I can recommend the cult, not bother with this. <br /> <br /> Director Knee is doing well, but the movie has the boring shot-on video made for television to watch it, it's completely forgettable & flat all the way through. There is no scare, there is no atmosphere and it lacks tension. There is also no one doing, of course there are a lot of blood stains, but no real actual make-up effects make scenes. With an assumed budget of approx. $ 950,000 cult looks cheap even though it's not as badly made as some low budget horror movies I've seen recently. The play is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Cool is a bad movie that didn't matter to me, I would struggle to call this average. There is much better horror movie out there.
