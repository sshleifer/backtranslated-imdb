The snarl ... <br /> <br /> The forest ... <br /> <br /> The acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The gutteral voice ... <br < br /> <br /> The fetish wear ... <br/> <br /> The chopped head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br /> GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> In fact, my sources say the Blade title role was not played by the diva of the 1980s, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not an improvement. Blades are an adaptation of a cartoon character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic, two-dimensional world of the printed page, it has become even more simplified and lost a few dimensions. The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, like Nosferatu, it seems to suck life out of the audience. In short, upward mobile vampire will become more powerful, but unlike Blade, half-man, half-vampire, all annoying. The whole climaxes with Blade are put in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most graceful CGI since 1968. Blade must be the least empathic since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comical adaptation, maybe there is a trend here?). Should the audience be supposed to be on the same page as the 'hero'? And while a vampire may be a tragic character, this is not true for Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, passionate, and not much better than the wicked. <br /> <br /> I suppose Wesley Snipes has a 'acting' career, so everyone else can be compared positively. As he cheats through his movie, you find yourself looking for a stake - even a pen - to put the leaves in the grave. <br /> <br /> As a piece of narcissism, Blade is virtually invincible - we are being treated to endless lingering shots of a fitness-fresh Snipes for no reason. Likewise, no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; they like Steven Dorff * CAN * act but they have to play second enemy to Snipe's boring performance. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson used to show up in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick, which you just know is not going to make it the last wheel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he hurries to the stage to avenge himself in the villains' giant underground lair. Why can't the domination of the world take place in a quiet country house? They always go to underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer ask if they were a little grandiose. Many of these plans could be stopped right now if the municipalities were more aware of the plans to expand the basement. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just as boring and imaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been made to be undefeated and perhaps they should be rested for a while - at least until someone can think in some way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To finish, there is a Grace Jones vampire movie called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.
