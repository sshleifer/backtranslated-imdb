Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br/> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Review: Sometimes movies can be Time capsules that transport you back to a given time. In this case, our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which transports us back to a time when Austin Powers would have felt at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of kids (where not a gang! was a group!) who loves to hang out in a cafe shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange surname ... wait ... it spells Dracula backwards!) A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks on. He offers them one night with black mass and black magic. As they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". So at no time flat, do they find themselves rebuilding Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuser homes. He does not know the people of his party, but they all celebrate the night in his house. To make fabrics, make and dance on the tables. The filmmakers made sure that this order was completely engrossed in what the youths were victorious at the time. Everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they end many of their sentences and say "all that jazz". So yes it is quite obvious that this is the 70s. To top it all, there is a band that looks like something like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I think you are drowned in all the 70s. And when I saw this, I kept asking myself, "How does Dracula with his black cloak and stand up to fit in all this?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels out of place in the midst of all party and rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the film are great .... but the music they decided to add to the case, unfortunately does not fit in well and takes you completely out of the mood of things. Something scary or frightening will happen on the screen, and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos begin to beat and your completely taken out of the horror element. It sucked the atmosphere right out of this movie for me. But all in all, all the distracting 70s set aside music (a disease that the Satanic Rites of Dracula also suffered) the movie was pretty good. But I will mention this. The story was just a re-hash of what we had previously seen in Taste Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is damn almost identical. Let's see ... a young boy inherits Dracula's ring and ashes ... check out. He then decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are entering. Black mass to bring Dracula back to a dismissed church ... check. The list of similarities continues and continues. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that make this movie worth it, though. For example, the movie is entertaining that the movie is a time capsule for London in the early 70s. I kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. I couldn't believe in any of the clothes these people had and the cars they were driving! It made the movie fun for me, but we are here to be spooked, here to watch Drac kill some virgins and avenge the Van Helsing House. Did we get any of it? Perhaps. There are a few good sequences pushed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans. First, there is the Black Mass sequence, which above all was satanic! They mention the name of many a demon and lots of blood spills. The sequence was amazing, but it was destroyed by the music at its most crucial moment. Then Dracula's actual resurrection, which I admit, was great from a visual point of view. Some fog comes out of Dracula's grave and slowly but surely Christopher Lee's silhouette and face emerge from the fog. Cold shot! I loved it! We have a Cushing and Lee face at the end. And I couldn't help laughing at a time when Dracula threw a piece of furniture through the air. I laugh because he did it in every movie since Horror of Dracula. Its this Hammer tradition where the characters begin to throw candles and trust each other. And I believe in myself is not their more exciting thing to show, so a bad guy throws a candlestick on our hero. Oh well, how Dracula's death in this one looks very much like all the other Hammer Draculas before the vampire is beaten and then we are cut to a number of frames until there is only ashes left. All in all, an unintentional fun Hammer Dracula movie. It is trapped in the 70s, and although it makes it a fun watch (and it's not as terrible as Satanic Rites of Dracula), it's still not good with the Dracula universe we had come to expect from Hammer . <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 out of 5
