What starts out as an acceptable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, harmless, incompetent, stupid attempted horror movies in recent years. <br /> <br /> Terrible. It is such a derivative rip out of every decent scarecrow you can think of successfully producing a single scare. Whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts passing the camera or the old school war at Fulci's Gates of Hell. The worst thing is that there is not even a cat jumping out of a closet to make you jump. Avoid.
