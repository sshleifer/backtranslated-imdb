Although the numbers are higher compared to other areas of society, I am not against the extremely high salaries of many of today's entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all also offer good with 8 figures or low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge refunds and fees they currently demand. Even their cast members and all the "Friends" group reached almost or over 7 characters per episode. Letterman's earnings for a show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two takes care of many for life. But all of these are based on sound supply and demand principals, and the economic benefits they bring to their employers. And everyone does their craft ably. <br /> <br /> But then comes someone like Rachel Ray who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find her scary, annoying and with a forced "perkiness" that is as fake as the wordy "3-dollar bill." <br /> <br /> One of my friends is responsible for special meetings, events, and convention plans for her company and its affiliates. One of the great talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $ 5-10K level, for a handful that gets $ 200K up and down. Appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and no fun, Larry Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There is a greater number in the $ 100.001 - 200,000 series; The list included Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even cable guy Larry's blessings, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I have to admit that there may be enough demand for her "talent" and offerings to justify her talk show, and there may be some out there paying more than $ 100K, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limo's door-to-door, for just a few hours of her whiny confused at their organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can't figure out how it could be possible.
