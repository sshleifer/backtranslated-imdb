Naked Deanna Troi! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with a reverse mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including a clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also places a table with a lot of nails on the floor near another window and smiles as he returns and sees bloody footsteps leading away. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - loaded in hillock with chaos and almost zero police response despite of the use of military weapons to knock down the dots by the score. As I understand, Bronson proclaimed this movie, but fortunately paid the check from the Golan Globus. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the quality movie, avoid this, but if you are in for a cheap "Jackass" kind of excitement, check it out.
