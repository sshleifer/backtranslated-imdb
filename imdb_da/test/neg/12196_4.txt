I saw this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was fascinated for the first full hour. It shaped itself to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue. Then everything fell to me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes. A large thriller was washed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was absolutely horrible. I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant start alone. I think it's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movie at all. If you are, you may disagree with my opinion.
