This movie is about a woman who falls in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From then on she will share her time with the two lovers: Jack of the day and Joseph at night. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it was made with a minimum budget. The majority of the film is set in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main players, all the other actors listed in the credits only make immediate appearances. The wardrobe designer does not seem to have much to do as the actors wear a lot of ground clothing, and in fact most of the time they are naked anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie is very dialogue-heavy, which should have made up for the above-mentioned shortcomings. However, the dialogues sound too complex and awkward. At the beginning of the movie, most of the dialogue is a person who says a very long sentence, and then the person says 'me too'. After the insanity of the agreement, the dialogue falls into a mess of incoherent and confused salad salad. The only merit of this movie I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet that conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment.
