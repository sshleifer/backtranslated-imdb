I was extremely disappointed with this one. Having just read the wonderful Oscar Wilde story, I had hoped for at least some of the magic to translate into the screen. Now there was no one. This version played as a condensed, dumbed down Reader's Digest movie. Not only did it feel rushed, it was cheap and unnecessarily re-written. Main characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulty of trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially what may well have been a limited (television) budget, but there is no excuse for missing a great story this way. I thoroughly recommend reading Wilde's tale of the corruption that exists under even the most beautiful exterior. But I can't advise anyone to rent this travesty.
