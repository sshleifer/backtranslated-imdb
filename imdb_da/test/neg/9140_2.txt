I'm a giant fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is quite correct that the stunning image of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the movie. I really really wish I had left it, instead of continuing to keep hope in the whole movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down. <br /> <br /> The result is almost a rehash from the two previous ones - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. It was good enough, though, that I would still like to check the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Just remember if you see this movie: if you come to realize that you are sometime not enjoying it, go ahead and split - you will not miss anything because it is not getting better. <br /> <br /> I will even give the summary here (warning! spoilers!): many shots of athletes who look almost good for a Nike advertisement, shoots of smiling people, inexplicable boring front pictures of famous people's wax dummies WTF thought they were here?!?), Some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some "bitchin" "Photoshop effects, some pictures intended to suggest a comparison of the flow of water, information, money and people ) ... and saw a bunch of fast independent scenes of mass violence ... and saw a bunch of storage space footage. <br /> <br /> I could reinvent this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy father with a shaved head and lycra bike shorts playing with a toddler with a kitten playing with a string; 5 seconds of the scene in "Network" where the guy talks about cheating with "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money runs out" 1 second by Reginald Denny gets brain with a brick and then 3 seconds by Alan Bean jump around the moon. <br /> <br /> There you go - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I've just saved. Of course, I will get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldn't look as blatant as it is. If Steven Soderbergh reads this, hey, I won't even need much money for this project ... If you insist on watching a movie about "Life as a War", I suggest "Bowling for Columbine" instead. It can't have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's fun.
