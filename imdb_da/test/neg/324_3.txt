In Halloween, three friends are seeking an old cemetery in the suburbs for fun and crossing a grave where Jack-O was buried many years ago by the peasant Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is released, kills the trio and seeks the family of Kelly for revenge. The cheesy "Jack-O" is a combination of a horrible story with horrible plays. I was curious about the name John Carradine in the credits and I can't imagine how a family allows the use of archive movies in such a poor movie that shows a total lack of respect with the name of this amazing actor. It is impressive how badly the play is, the film changes to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. It is the kind of movie that is good to watch with a group of friends, drink beer, make comments and laugh a lot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O? Dem√¥nio do Halloween" ("Jack-O? Demon of the Halloween")?
