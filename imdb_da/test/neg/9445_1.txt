I have to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, I can't believe I wasted $ 10 on blockbuster; This movie has to be burned and who ever thought about it has problems. Who ever used money to make this movie crazy = D This movie has AWFUL actors, and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where these "men" enter the restaurant (National Securities Department), which happened to be the worst part of the movie. How dare they say Frank Sinatra's name in vain? Also, what's with these glasses? When the guy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can tell she doesn't even drink! What's also with the freaky dinner guy. And everyone knows you don't support tires, you slash them.
