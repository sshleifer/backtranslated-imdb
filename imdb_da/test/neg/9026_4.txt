What a silly movie. While it looks good, it doesn't make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman before her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the aggrieved woman, and it seems like a kind of mental problem like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth hadn't been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction.
