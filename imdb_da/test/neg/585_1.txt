Terrible. The only way I could even start thinking about the fun is if it was fun by itself. "Amazing. It's about an ass fighting crime and he is drinking / smoking! How much fun! It's fun because where most people put things in their mouths, he puts them in himself! And now he gets sexual service from some ladies! The show is so amazing! "That's what I would have to say if I liked the show even though I'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm. I noticed some people have compared this show to 12 oz. Mouse and Squid Billies. Why would you even try? There's nothing to compare. The other two actually show a decent character development. In conclusion, I hate Assy Mcgee. I force with the name.
