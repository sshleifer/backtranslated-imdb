I haven't laughed so much for a long time - or seen a movie so inappropriate! Talk about it so bad it made me laugh! Firstly, I think that in approx. 40 percent of the film's length I could not tell what happened or even what I saw. I can only describe the camera's work as frantically fulfilling LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see is blurry flashes and fragments of hollow walls, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half of the movie and asked my teenage daughters what happened, but they couldn't do better than me. Then there are the "black" moments when we try to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's light goes out and the screen turns tone black - and I don't mean just for a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I think empty movies are a way to keep costs down. I think the "director" recently read a book about all "must-do's" to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in - approx. 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / It is short in 90 minutes (still one and a half hours too long!) 2 / All characters die (after all, it is impossible to worry about anyone of them). 3 / There was a really good scene - when the group looks up at the shaft, they came down and after finding their rope dropped to the bottom (so it comes), a large block is pushed over the opening and sealing them. I WASN it expects it and it was really chilling. <br /> <br /> And what about the early bonfire scene with the shot, after the shot, after shot panning behind the camp lights up. I swear the director spent almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I am positive that after the first kill, EXACT uses the same images of blood on the bottom of the hole twice in 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, a CRAP piece of film making. I see almost everything, but it's close to where I would draw the line.
