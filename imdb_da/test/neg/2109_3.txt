The movie starts in Mexico, where a girl has been cursed, she spits on snakes through green jello and her friend tries all these crazy magic to lift the curse. He does nothing but chanting terrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border on the train to get to L.A. to see his uncle lifting the curse. Comic hilarity follows. This movie has the same snakes again and again! It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. They make all the sound of rattlesnakes that doesn't make sense. The whole movie has some fun lines, some weak effects, but most importantly a big end that leaves you as WHAM BAM, HATS HAPPY HAPPY !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the end is a 10, so by my crazy math it gets a 3 overall. When blockbuster doesn't have anything else you want, take it here for thoughtless entertainment!
