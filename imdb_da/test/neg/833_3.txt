This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on television far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes start to be repeated over and over again. OK, from the start the first couple of series were pretty good. You had an entertainment manager (Simon Cadel) pursued by his deputy, played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady who wants to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic child-wearing punch and judy man, a bent jockey and a stand up comedian. As said before, it started well, but went too long. When Simon Cadel left it went downhill quickly, you got gloomy story stories and a new entertainment manager, who Ruth Madoc (again) threw herself on. When a comedy is all recorded in one place, there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately, it went so long, every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times. If this comedy had stopped after 2 series, it would have gone down like an all-time classic. As it is, it will be greatly remembered for the horrible last couple of series.
