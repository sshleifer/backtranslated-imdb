Okay, the idea itself is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not fly 2. Children do not fly with dirt 3. It made the Air Force resemble the total idiots 4. Unger's father would not put all his career at risk of allowing his boy to cheat with him 5. Neither would a reserve colonel <br /> <br /> The successors are certainly worse than this tripe. The soundtrack is about the only releasing quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why in the world anyone would write directly and produce such unsurpassed junk. The Iranian Air Force is fortunate to filtch a few parts for an aging F-14, and this kid does not wrangles 1, but 2 fully loaded and burned F-16s? Gimme a break.
