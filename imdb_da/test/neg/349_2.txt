Yes, the video cover of this movie made me see this movie as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this special tagline cover "Men turned in!" It even featured this crooked-looking skeleton on the cover as well, which made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. Perhaps some kind of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that is more bloody looking than what you normally get, a science experiment has gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh are dripping their bones go on rampage. Yes, all of these thoughts ran through my heart, one that was not a fish feeder on an island with almost none and everything. This movie is really more like the island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and, frankly, the movie bore me too, it's way too much scientist and not enough to kill for my taste. These movies are too much figure out and not enough blood for my taste. Yes I know I have strange tastes, but I can't help it, I like my horror movies, either really bloody or fast moving and exciting, this movie is not.
