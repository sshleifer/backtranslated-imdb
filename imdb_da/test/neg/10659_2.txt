The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know she wants) and leave 30 minutes to pack things up. The story is so predictable that you know everything about approx. 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess the movie is a movie in the future, but the movie is full of stereotypes that are just over the top: <br /> <br /> Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping aren't all . She realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world". Touch. <br /> <br /> The mother - high-strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) who needs to take care of a strong man. Father - patient and always understanding and taking care of the uninhibited woman. <br /> <br /> The girlfriend who only wants to get into her pants. The comical clown Chinese guy who does not know how to speak English properly and made a laugh. Thought Hollywood dropped these signs in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse, who at times knows everything about getting around China, that next time is a carbon copy of the mother, ie. a woman who cannot cope with that situation or know anything. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl who, with the help of us westerner, gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third continent according to the movie) has nothing and therefore needs our charity. Guy, wake up and lug what you change. <br /> <br /> Make sure there is some poverty in China, but the depiction of support from Western countries (read US) is so superficial and happy that it is sad and disgusting. Shanghai (where the movie is set) is the most growing and evolving city in the world at the moment. The Chinese father, who is so nice and kind-hearted that it finally has a desire ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... the teacher (sean astin) who has this really heart ripping story (not) as he tells without feeling. Why Sean? WHY !? <br /> <br /> Etc etc. It's hard to actually find a "real" person throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This is nothing but a good movie for Americans under age 15. If you want to learn about the world clock, for example Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or in an aging movie, I suggest that you see the Italian "Cinema Paradiso", which won the best foreign film academy, a few years back. <br /> <br /> The only lovely thing in the movie was the little town scenes that really catch some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese country side. I've been there and seen some of it.
