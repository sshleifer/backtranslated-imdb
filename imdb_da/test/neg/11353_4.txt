"Mararía" really disappointed me. I can't think of it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed premature and untrustworthy to evoke any emotion. Dr. Fermín shows some unprecedented bizarre behavior out of a passion that one cannot really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Maria? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never seemed to be a real character, rather more like a movie stereotype that just had to be in the movie (... or else was another title necessary?). Some of the best plays came from a role that was not really important to history, namely Marcial, the sub-intelligent but humble drunkard. Of course, the nature of the Canary Islands, the cultural scenery and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film was short for a documentary film (if that was its true intention) and most importantly as a solid drama.
