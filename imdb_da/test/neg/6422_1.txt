If you watch this movie in the TV overview, you ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'll be better off seeing reruns of X-Files. <br /> <br /> Previous comments that refer to the incredibly bad acting of the female leader have died. She is almost unattainable. The sum of her assortment includes 'whiny and scared' and 'whiny and not scared'. <br /> <br /> I'm the kind of movie buff that has a good 'bad' movie. But that's ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is so simplified as the number of numbers they continue to throw at you and much like the set number it ends up having some meaning in the end. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent turning your TV off and giving your dog a bath.
