I have long tried to understand why people like Shakespeare so much and every few years I give him another walk. I hoped this game / movie (my 6th different Shakespeare game) would unlock the lucky coffin and marry the riches of this literary demigod. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. When the term "pound of meat" had been said 10 minutes in the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, merging with a dull script and lifeless action. At each stage, the plot is put on two scenes in advance. The concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband using a lottery is incredible. It is not surprising to win the marriage jackpot because Bassanio is a main rologist in the play .... and he is the third man to try .... and there are three caps to choose from ... and his friend is at risk life to pay usage. The only real surprise I had seen on this movie is that it didn't end immediately after the trial. But as soon as the ring treason began, it was immediately apparent what would expire. <br /> <br /> So I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not to the surprise of the well-known stories, but to the depth and passion of the characters. But I felt nothing for the characters. Instead of grabbing excitement and admiration under the kingdom scene, however, I was hoping that it would be over, thank you. <br /> <br /> One day I can only find a Shakespeare game that does nothing but drill me.
