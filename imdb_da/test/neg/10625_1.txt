I received this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know I'm a big fan of low-budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios has always made the cheesy gory flicks delivered. I loved watching their movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I looked Bugged ... WHAT HAPPED? <br /> <br /> This movie started with a pretty good concept of mutating bugs and even added some smart comedies, but in general writing is just bad, and it was error number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to be a better writer first before becoming a filmmaker. After reading the Credits we discover, he played the most important role in the movie!?! two words Mr. Director "Acting Lessons" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the line of other writers / directors who plunged into their own films, and that is second error. <br /> <br /> The only thing I thought saved this movie was the artistic camera work and musical score (let's hear it for the crew!) Cast by other actors who at the beginning of this production seemed a little cold , really heated towards the middle and end of this production. Everyone pulled together and helped pull this movie out. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to become a decent director or actor, but I will tell him. He seems to know how to organize people to get everyone to come together and withdraw his productions. <br /> <br /> This movie I have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if Mr. Armstrong was able to pull it off, anybody else can. If you get the chance to watch this movie, watch it for inspiration to make "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better Horror Flicks to keep this genre back from his grave.
