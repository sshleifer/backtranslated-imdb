Of course, all this nonsense question speaks 'Is a genre as self-reflective as the teenage comedy really needs another parody movie?' The unhappy 'Scary Movie' (I and II) took the formula as far as it could go - 'Not Another Teen Movie' really doesn't have anything that is either intelligent or shockingly exaggerated to add. <br /> <br /> The reason, which is based mainly on fairyfloss teenflic 'She's All That', goes in a shaky line between parody and homage ('John Hughes High School'). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is used for references. The result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. The downside of giving us a copy of 'She's All That' is that we all know where it goes anyway. And if we didn't, the jokes would be meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The token-broken scene (an erupted toilet) seems badly out of place here among all the 'feel-good' references. There are humorous moments - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is sent to the audience's way. It stinks, don't see it.
