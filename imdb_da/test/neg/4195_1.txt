Besides the comments on the product's technical advantages or lack thereof, the action is absolutely horrible. What is really scary about this movie is that I actually own a copy of it, of course, it was in a trading box and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2" and after seeing it, I can understand why it was at the checkout - they should have paid me to take it out of their stock. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie, if you want to call it, is being used by a scary father running around a cornfield maze seeking her daughters because he has a feeling that something is coming to them. I suppose the camera that the girls played at the start of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this failure. In the maze he runs into the ghost of some children who are poorly finished and the film goes terribly south from there. <br /> <br /> I can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never have let go of them. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever had to sit through and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
