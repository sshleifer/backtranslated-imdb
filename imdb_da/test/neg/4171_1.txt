Apparently, I swim against the flow of the glowing comments on this movie. I haven't seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing I remember clearly ... <br /> <br /> Bunyip was TERRIFYING !!! Nightmare inducing scary. With that creepy music and little girl and kangaroo running / jumping for their lives ... As a kid, I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries. Watership Down? Don't blink an eye. Dot and kangaroo? It still mocks my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who also think it was massively scary. Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy. <br /> In short: a freaky movie for its time.
