The action is generally rather weak. The dialogue was also apparently called for the movie, so it just doesn't come in time. What do you want for a TV movie? <br /> <br /> Annette O'toole was ok; there were a couple of strong lines from the queen's mother. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, these children were not quite up to it. Don't impress my kids either. <br /> <br /> At the top it is only one hour long. In view of that, it became honest through a plot and character development. Settings and movies are also ok. <br /> <br /> Some other viewers like it for sentimental reasons.
