I watched this movie on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I liked his performance in "The Object of My Affection" a lot, and I really expected a good job. But I found this movie a complete mess. The story has a very confused manuscript and the characters are not well developed. Moreover, the low budget special effects do not help much. I don't know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I can't remember exactly why I gave this character (and I don't intend to watch this movie again), but my voice is four. Title (Brazil): 'Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração' ('Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation')
