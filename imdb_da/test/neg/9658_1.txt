This movie was absolutely horrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (6-13 years old) couldn't bear to see it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's like some people were sitting around having a beer and saying, "Hey, let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?" It's so bad. Besides Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the movie, I do not recognize a single other actor. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot (I) and I generally like stupid and stupid movies, but this movie doesn't have a single redemption quality. The people who wrote it do not have the slightest idea of ​​how children think, speak or act, and the film is a disparate mess of terrible corny lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but it's the worst movie I've seen since Man's best friend and it's certainly one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember I warned you. The fact that some people have actually rated this movie as being good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
