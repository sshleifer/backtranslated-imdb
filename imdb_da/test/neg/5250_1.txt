Ha ha! Firstly, if you've never seen a "Dimension Film" your for a real treat! Known primarily for SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror / Slasher movies, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more like ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F-T mark on the side. <br /> <br /> Consider Anachronisms! <br /> <br /> We had: light, armor, sword .... But we saw: telescopes, soled shoes, cigarette lighters, speakers, electricity, body bags, aluminum foil tins, and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something that happens in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's very ridiculous. It's really a comedy made to look like a horror movie! I couldn't stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - must really have taken a thumb in his career if he works for "Dimension Films". <br /> <br /> I've learned my lesson though. I'm looking at the movie studios on the videos, a lot more exactly now. <br /> <br /> RATED NO REELS OUT OF FIVE. If you want a good laugh, it's hard to pass on this job! <br /> <br /> This movement had some splitting in spots - I especially liked the blonde bimbette! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
