I have seen this at Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and left the cinema halfway through this movie (with a lot of other people), so I may not be the right one to comment on it, but I think the fact leaving "SC" is reason enough to do it. "S.C." is another movie. People who need a coherent narrative, character or plotline find nothing in it. It must be an experimental movie that relies on the power of the images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention to just break people out that they have nothing else to say. The off-narrator's gibberish is simply boring, the images are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why bother? Hussein's films will be shocking and thought-provoking - instead, it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is art, and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos any more - especially if everything is done as badly as in "S.C.". I would suggest that Director Hussein either visit a psychiatrist or a film school before he fails shit for art again. Note: I will never see a baby being slashed during birth again.
