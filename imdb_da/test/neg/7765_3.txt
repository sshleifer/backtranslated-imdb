All my friends and various other colleagues think this show is so good. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I can be the only female alive !!! I've only seen it because my best friend loves it and seems to be Charlotte's character! First, the whole plot (if you can call it that) is about four women super close Samantha (Kim Cattrall) most likely to have each STD available and mossy, brown and green genitals considering she's tri sexual (she wants to try something). <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like any 40 women in NY even though the show wouldn't have any entertainment as Samantha (along with some good NY scenes) is the only reason to watch And they are not reason enough. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed upper class NY idiot who still thinks Pince Charming myth! But sweet and beautiful she is, don't let it fool you, she spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is stereotypically angry, butch feminist. I believe in an episode that she is thought of as a lesbian, but apparently it's not ... What a shame she's almost interesting. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the most annoying character. I swear I thought I saw Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider's more male look, cross dressing, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl looking for, can not live without you love .... Heard of a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I love to make fun of it because I hear about some kind of new awakening for women. It's just sad if you seem to see plain, pathetic, addictive people in the way of expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitan and pretending to be an annoying 15 year old on cocaine than there is a show for you ..... ...... just use protection.
