I have to hold my hand up and say I was one of the first (and probably the last one!) To watch this movie. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction was of course the soundtrack. It is of course brilliant - that is what Himesh does best. But, as they say, do not give up your daily job - HR should definitely not. <br /> <br /> HR's action is plain and simply horrible. Although the movie had a plot, what baffles you the most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell is doing there. Two words for advice to HR - abandon trades and secondly use chapstick. HR has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female manager just looks a little too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vamp crap. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you want, but if there is no fabric, it won't last. Don't waste your money ...
