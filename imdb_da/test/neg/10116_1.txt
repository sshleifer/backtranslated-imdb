It's hard, and I didn't expect it ... But it's really the worst movie my wife and I saw. Terrible dialogues stretching beyond comprehension over time without any apparent reason except to fill the time. The storytelling does not follow a comprehensive understandable way ?? everything is a mess. The action and dialogs are displayed by jump. What disappointed me the most was watching Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this ?? Uh ?? I don't even know how to describe it without being polite ?? The rest of the actors where in the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, which made a flat inaccurate performance. Bad special effects. I don't think it was a complete waste of movies, but it's close to ?? If I say I would advise everyone not to watch this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Sincerely, I never even wanted to say anything about this movie, but ?? there is always a first time.
