I just registered with IMDb.com so I could comment on this movie. My god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was! It shouldn't even be adorned as a real movie, it's a lot of fraud. This is a 15-year film project at best. The action is horrible. But even good actors couldn't save this. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote this crap? And the constant joke coming from the shabby lesbians about Kaye as a "ladies in need" grew old really fast. God, I'd rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than see this shot again. Don't rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free, don't look at it. smash it with a hammer. Even if smashing this video made you lose your Hollywood video or blockbuster video account, it would be worth it. this is an abomination. I suppose I have said everything I can about this without being superfluous. any question .... email me.
