This film is about a depressed and emotionally distressed man having a distant relative movement into him in his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until he starts shouting at his own guest - who is out of work and does not look to anyone who is eager to find work. In fact, it is most of the movie. The problem is that, although emotionally cramped and depressed people are very retracted and non-communicative, they do not make a very satisfying movie. That's because most of the time he (and his roomie) just stares into the room and says nothing. I think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie - I certainly wouldn't be happy.
