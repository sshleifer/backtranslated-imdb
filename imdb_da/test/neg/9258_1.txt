The Staten Island film maker Andy Milligan is known in the horror community to be an even worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a weak example of his production, I tend to agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones" we have almost three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home (located on a conveniently secluded island) to collect an inheritance. They are killed by one after another and the events unfold in murder / mysterious fashion with a scared retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop. The movie is so bad that it looks like someone has just driven it through a dishwasher, the sound is awful, the dialogue is elsewhere bad, there are some primitive mannequin gore (plus some dismemberments and gut) and it is technically scary at all possible Ways It May Be Ineffective. But is it fun in a bad movie kind? Sort of. It is eerie to see, but strangely entertaining on a train cut. Procedure with caution. If you are not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one.
