Zombie Planet seems like an example of good ideas and commendable ambitions that exceed the budget. I thought the explanation for the zombies was genuine original and gnarly, and loved the dog munching in the exposure scene. The rest of the gore was effective in a low budget a little way, but also separated throughout the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Well, they had an exciting if derived plot line and a similar well-known but cool setting, but a low budget zombie movie really should be goretastic to make an impression and there just wasn't enough red moments in this for me. I think there were surpluses of cheap looks and bloodless fighting scenes as well, especially considering the generally minimal dread. Plus, for a two hour movie, there is very little closure at the end, and although it makes me very well track Zombie Planet 2, I felt a bit cheated. So probably most worth looking for the two of them.
