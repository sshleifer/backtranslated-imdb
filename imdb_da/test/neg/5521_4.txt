HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite programs when it was broadcast in 1974. But the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a complete lack of humor to slam this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to redeem It succeeded US GRAFFITTI. <br /> <br /> There were some similarities between US GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. <br /> <br /> Both were opened with "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & Comets. Both took place in a bygone era, and both included Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some big differences. While American GRAFFITTI took place in 1962 in California and centered on a group of newly graduated high school students taking the big step in adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and centered on a group of high school teens dealing with joys and hardships. adolescence. HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the jukebox, which played the original version of Bill Haley & Comets' ROCK Around the Clock. But when the oldies became hot, thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI, and the original 1954 version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalties went through. So a "remake" of the song (the correct expression is now "new stereo recording") was quickly replaced. <br /> <br /> The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then introduced in the second season, if the memory serves me right. <br /> <br /> Fans and enemies agree that this show is escapist. Freedom was taken and details overlooked, making this show less than authentic. <br /> <br /> This is just fine. HAPPY DAYS should be a comedy, not a history lesson. But sometimes the authors sometimes kept their throats turning on controversial issues. An episode centered around the Cunninghams building from an outside fall. Another episode was about a divorced woman who moved into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life. The topic of prejudice was dealt with when Howard was invited to a wedding by an old roommate who had just turned black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American lifestyle). The draft draft even came up with a later episode! <br /> <br /> The display was originally set in 1955. A problem that was dealt with wisely was with the cast. Most of them were teenagers, and as each year passed, it was obvious that they were older, so the series aged with the cast, moved the series out of Eisenhower's annual water in the Camelot age, completely in the way of JFK and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. That, along with the authors running out of ideas and later, cast members like Ron Howard, who left the series, wisely quit while they were ahead, left me, and wished they all had done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and finish while they were ahead. That along with the idol-worshiping studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the big Fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very thin very quickly. <br /> <br /> This show originally featured the Fabulous Fifties as we like to remember the era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place, and although I prefer to hear the "original hit versions" of the "new stereo recordings", these "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I find myself sorry that I buy the DVD! In contrast to the complete first season DVD, the original music is replaced with other music throughout the second season. While it's amazing that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show fun to watch!
