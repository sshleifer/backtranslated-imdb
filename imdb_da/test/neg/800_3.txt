A box with a button allows a couple to be financially free, but the price is the life of someone they have never met. This is a very boring movie to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a movie with no payout. You are taken on a slow build ups trip, one after another with lesser revelations at best. At certain moments, I thought of myself, it will be of great importance at the end, but nothing does. The film just leaves a thought: "This story could have been told for 30 minutes, without all the extended nonsense." I hope you avoid this god-horrible movie and maintain your hygiene by doing so.
