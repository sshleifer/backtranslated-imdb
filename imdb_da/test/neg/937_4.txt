The Lifetime channel aired this in October, but I only came to see it now. It's the old eternal triangle again ?? small town Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui) on the eve of her departure to law school in New York, thinking of her for the next five years he does not contract and Panties run into her again when he returns home after his father's death on the eve of a big exam five years later, and again becomes involved with her romantic again. But director and co-author Matthew Cole Weiss goes way over the top and hit the whole thing in flashback when Dave admits murdering Emily, her husband and another of her lovers in front (here comes spoiler) a lesbian policeman who is also a flame by emily s Weiss transfers the "fluttering" effect with which Dave gets to see the clumps of his former life-flash for the eyes, even before he is actually dead, cutting them even though Dave and Emily have sex and thereby destroying the soft core shotshots that give themselves Some otherwise pretty lame Lifetime movies at least a little crowd appeals. I couldn't help blinking back to James M. Cain, and how much better did he write women like this in his classic thrillers (all custom hit movies) "The Postman Always Rings Twice", "Double Indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce." It also doesn't help that the movie ends with the evil guys (the bad girls actually) victories and the decent whose naive and stupid hero apparently headed for the deadly injection table ?? or that the actors playing the people Dave and Emily cheat, both look better than they are. Although this movie went directly to cable in the United States, there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swearing words were blown, so I suppose this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world.
