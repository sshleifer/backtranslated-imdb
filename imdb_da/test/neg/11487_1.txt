It will be difficult to get this to fill 10 lines .... But otherwise try it (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as I did - to watch this (terrible and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I like Patrick swayze - he did an excellent performance in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North and South (TV series), but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, the play is terrible - the script sucks - well .. i can't even find a good thing, nothing, absolutely nothing .. i saw it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of those most boring movie we had ever seen, and the fact that it lasts more than 3 hours (which we didn't know) - since part 1 was over and it said "continued", we almost screamed "nooooooooooooo, we must see 90 minutes more of this movie !!!! ". <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is painful: In no time do you get the impression that the actors are Russians, the action scene e is extremely bad. The only good scene is when the truck explodes at the start of the movie! The rest is CRAP! Clean your toilet instead of watching the movie (and don't get started, crying if you watch this movie - you were warning!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and make them remember this movie - its so bad.
