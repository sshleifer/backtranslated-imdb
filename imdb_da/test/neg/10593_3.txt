I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have some of the "books" printed from the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they're pretty light so I don't expect much from the movie. That's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long string. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of making a movie so completely true to the hit of the 1960s. The film environment has, however, achieved sophistication for 30 years. At least I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept with (now old) car gates (now considered bad) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and everything on the big screen. In the 1960s we didn't care so much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police commission of young people wearing something beyond suits was enough. That's what another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password." <br /> <br /> Rate this "episode" against the usual theater releases, the story was ... Well, I'm not sure I should tell myself, because I'm not sure there was one. Drugs are bad? No matter what. The script was silly. When the characters exchange dialogue and promote the plot with lines like "I overheard him say it on the phone" and "I think I got a plan", we are really in trouble. No wonder the play was terrible: no one knew how to say such idiotic lines. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would go after my agent with a flame thrower right now. (In fact, I think everyone in and see the movie has the right to seek retaliation.) <br /> <br /> And where was the courage in that team? I realize these kids just got out of the juvenile hall, but nobody had a velvet suit? "Mod" meant only young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Maybe the costume department went too gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy. When the film was completely true to the original series, and demanded special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still don't like it. If I wanted to see the 60's criminal drama, I'd buy DVDs. No thanks.
