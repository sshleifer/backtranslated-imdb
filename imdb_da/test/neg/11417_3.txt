To put it simply, it was a pompous piece of dog pop. Everything for stagey and everyone is the total melodramatic drama queen at every moment. After a while, I began to wish that every character in the movie was not such an engrossed anal reluctant. <br /> <br /> And this movie has another of the really annoying things that have recently come into fashion and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in some sort of leaching, blue-steel grayness. Hmmm, the last time I checked, lights and flashlights are quite capable of setting a fairly wide range of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the warm, yellowish-orange spectrum. So where is all the blue-steel-gray light coming from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fancy sets and sparkling cgi eg, but it's still drunk. It is pathetically undesirable to play the day's movies, easily placed by pathetic junk. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a lot of vampires and werewolves as movie plots, but it was a total hack job. <br /> <br /> Universal Studios' 1941 "The Wolfman" is infinitely superior to this, although it is, for example, quite primitive to what could be done today. <br /> <br /> I've finished this franchise. The first movie was reasonably decent. The other still somewhat entertaining. But the one I couldn't even finish until the end, because it was so boring.
