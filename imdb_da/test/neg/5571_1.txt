Wow. So my girlfriend and I went to the movie store to rent a movie. I like silly horror movies, so I looked at the many horrible movies they had to offer as he went hunting for Michael Moore's 'Sicko'. Then I found the worst of them all (which I would soon find out). It looked good on the cover, and the description on the back seemed decent enough. The fact that there was an IMDb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night we put it in the DVD player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The movie is totally incoherent, with poorly placed jumps from the past to the future let you ask a bigger 'WTF? The plot has no kind of coherent history - except for the vague connection to a local myth of a murder, but it will only play in the movie for the last twenty minutes. So pretty much for the first hour you have this: random, confusing time lapse; incoherent plot; Parents who do not age bad acting; poor dialogue; a boy who changes magic color and a wealth of unpleasant signs for you to get bored! <br /> <br /> The movie moves so slowly that it is a task to actually sit there and watch. I'd rather scrub the toilets. Don't bother with that.
