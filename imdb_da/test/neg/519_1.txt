This movie has to rank down with Ed Wood movie. A terrible script and bad, bad play. <br /> <br /> A machine gun battle in front of glass sheets; minutes go by before someone is hit and no one has coverage - not a window ever breaks. You would think of a fire fight, so the large U-Haul truck can be riddled - not a scratch. Make CIA agents and public contractors = shout = Top Secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is no actor you care about; all are superficial and basically unlikely. A Hawaii-bound 747 flies out of Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". A short time goes by when the operator notifies the other five passengers that they have only two hours of air left; on a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day, the rescue teams and amazingly six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A movie that starts mediocre and goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br />
