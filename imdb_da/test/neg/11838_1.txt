This movie does not even deserve 1/10 This film was a scam. I swear that at least 30 minutes of the movie was DELIBERETLY copied from Carnosaur 1, 2, and 3. Whole movies "Raptor" was based on the movie, and it was truly a pathetic attempt to be a "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur" copy . I loved the movie series and seeing it being put on a movie that can't afford or willing COPY it without making there own models is what America comes to. I recommend that you watch the Carnosaur movie FIRST (all of them) and then watch this and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
