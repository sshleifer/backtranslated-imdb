Extremely silly movie, which is basically a compilation of horror, science fiction and thrill movie clips. There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the rocks, and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the audience turning to the camera and explaining why we love horror movies. Not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("movie music helps us deal with real horror", "you are in the cinema's mercy in a theater") and rather tired. Also, the clips appear very quickly and the changes are slightly damaged. And shown out of context, these bits are not very scary. And it's REAL card - I saw it in a theater back in 1984 and was worried that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84 minute movie! <br /> <br /> It's still reasonably edited, and Allen and Pleasance seem to enjoy themselves. For people who have an interest in knowing more about terror, it can be fun and interesting. But if you are a horror fan (like me) you will probably be bored silly. Good idea, poor execution (no pun intended). I give it a 3.
