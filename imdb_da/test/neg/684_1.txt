This is the movie is really bad. I like to turn on the TV while relaxing and this movie looked like it would be good to sleep through, and boy was I wrong. My body literally woke me up from sleeping and said "Hi ... this movie is horrible ... you have to see it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. Something about accidental comedy makes me go. This movie is impressive crappy. I really don't know how to properly express it except to recommend you to see it just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should see it in humans. I made the best jokes outloud under this movie and no one was there to hear them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
