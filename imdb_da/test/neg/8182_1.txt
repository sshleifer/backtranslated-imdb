This movie is strange, even for a quiet movie. Essentially, it follows the adventurers of an engineer in the post-revolutionary Russia who daydreams to go to Mars. In this movie, it seems that the producers KNOW, that the Communists have really turned up the country, but also seem to have it look as if they have achieved something good. <br /> <br /> Then we get to "Martian" scenes where everyone on Mars wears goofy hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by Earth men, but are quickly betrayed by the Queen sitting with them. Apart from that, everything is a dream, or is it. (And given that the Russian revolution ultimately leads to the Stalin dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it was all allegory.) Now I've seen good Russian cinema. For example, Eisenstein's Battlehip Potemkin is a great movie. It's just good, silly.
