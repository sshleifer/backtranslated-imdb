"Shade" is trying hard to be another "sting" that replaces poker for horse racing as a means of bringing down an enemy, but otherwise it fails. <br /> <br /> I saw it all and still couldn't quite understand why the young child wanted to cross his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girl? Is there a woman in the world who is worth going so much in the way? If there is, it certainly wasn't this shrew. She had no redeeming capabilities at all, and really now she had a special room set up so a surgeon could remove the kidney from the one trying to get her into a bar? Dina Merrill makes a short look like a rich woman who hosts all things, pays-the-rent poker parties in her neat home. And then the players say things like, "I want to see your thousands and raise you another five thousand." Give me a break. You can't call ("see") and raise you do one or the other. Every child plays for nickel and dimes at the kitchen table knows this; You would think that adult men played for stakes to a great extent - or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script - would also know it. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to actually handle their own cards and I agree. You don't allow two of the most well-known bilecats in a game where the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then let them trade with each other. It's not poker; It's just to see who can cheat better. And I want to know which person in his right mind would buy into a game where two of the best-known card cheats are playing and expect him to have the chance to win? And most of all, what Mafia boss would run such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith came on the screen, I was so fascinated by the giant fluorescent red lips of her that I completely lost the story, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a public service announcement to plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection. Stallone mentions that she used to be a getter before she bought the restaurant she is now driving, but we do not know what kind of bills she was, and we never see her working with Stallone in their younger days so we are left over to wonder if we don't care immediately. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he is killed just outside bats and we are left with cardboard cuts that all sound like they're reading their lines of a teleprompter just off -camera. the end also makes no sense. The child gets its cut from the game and just goes down the street with a folder full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? The Mafia doesn't look at all the traits he does? Everyone else shakes their shoulders and silently accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recover some of it? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this movie makes a huge injustice for professional poker players around the world, indicating that the only way to win is by playing palms and playing with "juiced" tires. And why is it always that they palms kings and aces? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the entire movie are the tremendous tricks at the beginning and end of the credits; everything in between is ridiculous.
