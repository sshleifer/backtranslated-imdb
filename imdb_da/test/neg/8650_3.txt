This film is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audiences. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Action is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they show a wrong picture and set a bad example for the young. Tanisha appears by drinking from a bottle or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the film. The director does not even recognize that she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. Throughout the film, she only wears bikini tops, whether she is at work, on the beach or at a wedding. The heart of the film makes this the young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. The less said about Uday Chopra's failure, the better Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ role as the arrogant girls chaser. The film is about gender equality. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead of doing the right thing to do the right thing. If men have been shown as chronic Casanovas in film, this does not mean that women should also behave the same way. <br /> <br /> Although the film is made in light hearted fun, it promotes so many wrong social performances in the name of being forward, the "fun" part of the movie has no influence. Not even in Canada do women dress like this, or guys behave like they've shown in the movie. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even of Canadian society. Perhaps they should have a disclaimer in the beginning stating, "All characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the movie." The only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hours, thank goodness.
