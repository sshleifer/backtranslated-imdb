Once in a while, Theresa Russell made a couple of half-decent movies, so I hope one of her past decades or two will make a rating of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is only the latest in a number of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very hard to see. The lines are provided by leading actors as if they are being read at a first test or even a casting session (where the actors do it for their agents, but don't really want the parts they are perfunctorily reading). The sets and props seem to be "off" somehow (what kind of police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelves full of case officers?). The screen is constantly cluttered with pointless time and data lines that do not appear without rhyme or reason. Now, if the screenwriter stood here after the lights went up from a movie festival screen, they would undoubtedly throw on how all these flaws are really clever traces to the plot turning topsy-turvy in this misfire last five minutes. Well for the audience whose only other movie experiences are TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; they could be bamboo readers to nod on their heads in accordance. But it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their lives - and not a close friend or relative of a DARK WORLD cast or crew - could fall to such a lama canard. Despite what, e.g. box can make you believe this movie has roughly the same with SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrative unit) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist unit) as a drained Jim Beam bottle refilled with urine must booze!
