The most self-sufficient movie I have all had the misfortune to <br /> <br /> rent. Unwatchable. Much of the film is of course improvised, <br /> <br /> and not good. It seems that Toback took the first withdrawal of <br /> <br /> everything. The movie gets good in a few minutes when <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. turns out and goes to hell quickly. <br /> <br /> fast.
