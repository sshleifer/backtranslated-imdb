I don't care what others say, this movie is the worst piece of waste made on film. What was John Landi's thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a number of children's books, but come on! Even children hate this movie. It is pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again shows that his only talent is wasting production money. I think the only reason that stupid is not appearing on the 100 worst movies all the time is that only 20 or so people will admit to seeing this waste. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.
