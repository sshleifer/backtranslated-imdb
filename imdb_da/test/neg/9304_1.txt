This is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and Schindler's List has actually been laughing. This not only tells you how unfunny this movie is and how big SL is, as it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet with "Yahoo Serious" so I could personally smash him for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he has ever been in. There are also very few things to say about Australia as they like this stupid fruit. Don't make me wrong people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are good, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very nauseous that people like this waste, (A review I just read said it was "very fun," maliciously, isn't it). I personally will boycott this movie and will launch a petition online to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious's movies to be it and I emphasize this so RETARDED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, call Clockwork Orange style, call me to commit euthanasia for you for free.
