Orson Welles' documentary film "F for Fake" in 1974 examines trickery and fraud that focuses primarily on two men who have been subjected to fraud themselves. Clifford Irving is a cinema that wrote the alleged fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography, but at least it seems to be his innocence. The second major in the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has used his life paintings of famous masterpieces, and sometimes sells them to museums as genuine works by original artists. Interspersed among these stories is bits where Welles makes magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied to his resume and then created a radiosensation with "World of War ". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie and find it profound since I'm such a Welles devotee, but I couldn't make it. Part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just nonlinear, it was completely scattered. While I appreciate stylish editing and fast jumping and zooming, especially when used in an unusual format as a documentary, there was simply too much of it in "F for false". They created a distraction as opposed to lending style. If the story was more clear and comprehensive, I think editing would probably not have been so annoying. The scattered storytelling was made so much more disturbing that these were really interesting topics, especially Elmyr de Hory. His artistic fakery brings up the subject of fraud in the art world, and who is truly capable of determining the authenticity of certain works; and if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? This is a documentary that I would say for at least giving a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you don't enjoy it. It's definitely the most discombobulated documentary I've ever seen; It is a cross between a documentary, an art film and experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. I have no lesser opinion about Welles after seeing it, but in my opinion it is not shining like a glowing test in his oeuvre. 4/10 --Shelly
