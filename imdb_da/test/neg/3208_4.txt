Sending the critics to the room seems like an entertaining idea, but was there really a need for a third movie, much less this fourth? A movie with Brad Dourif may not be too bad, can it? Well, maybe in this case. This cheap sci-fi action stars return lovingly klutz Charlie (the trustworthy Don Keith Opper) who is about to exterminate the last two remaining eggs of Critters' species when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him he is about to break a form of trans-galactically endangered species. So at Ugh's request, Charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a pad. Unfortunately, for Charlie, the damned thing takes off the room and he's trapped inside. The smoke beneath his feet puts him in hibernation and he wakes up 53 years later in a diminishing <br/> <br /> space station as Captain Rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic evil and greedy to the core blowing opening space pod trying to see What news is for possible sales or trading. Rick, unknown to him, lets out the two critters attached to his meat. You see, Rick and his crew found the buttocks drive and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it. Ugh reports to them (now in a fine and prominent position as an advisor) that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the Terracor organization. When the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruins with many corridors in poor condition, but the worse is the station's computer Angela. Angela is a real thorn in the side of the crew because she has been left without proper maintenance for some time. It takes some small tricks to get doors to open and close, not to mention lifts and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, largely impresario of computer features (.. and is basically the real leader of the group, for he is the most planned and intelligent). He appears to be a father figure to Ethan (Paul Witthorne) who just wants to make it to the ground to find his father. However, this story does not necessarily go to its zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is primarily in the movie to be a druggie victim of critters to munch on. In the movie, Charlie, after a critter enters Rick's mouth and eats away at the throat, the crew's guide to understanding what they are fighting against. The movie has some elements I found a little confusing (or a better word, ridiculous). The two critters grow in size quickly, somehow being able to coordinate a ship to Earth, not to mention growing to massive size in this lab in the space station. The crew is able to get a log from a Dr. McCormick {Anne Ramsay, whose brand is in a coat thrown to the side that Ethan discovers her passport}, shows signs that Terracor looked at creating a species to eradicate worlds and humans. Knowing this is Al Bert who wants to leave Angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. Things don't go that way, because well-meaning Charlie (thanks to Al Bert's "old" Colt .45) kills a critter who had come on board, but by firing several bullets hit large steering systems in the ship. So many repairs in order, but they stop them when Ugh and his storm troopers dock at Angela and prove they are not what Charlie thought they would be. Ugh is a changed man, and Charlie realizes that he is totally evil, and his mission is to preserve the Crites for a cruel character (representation of corrupt corporate government types?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie .. he may have grown a bit (a little bit) and now understand that some people are just getting worse. Charlie and Ugh come to a face-off over these critters .. will the crew be able to escape a space station that has set auto-destruct? This movie really does not utilize critters as much as the other three films. I think we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise. The first movie was a hoot .. a really entertaining drum. But at the time of this sequel cam around, the critter just dried their welcome. The cast, however, gives the film a boost. Critics get a bit to feed, but their plans for global dominance are underdeveloped. Their role in the film is not established at the highest altitudes. I told myself you have this huge space station with the unlucky catch on board. Can't you take this idea and run it? Unfortunately, they don't.
