Well, when it is called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato, I went into this movie that expects sleaze ... and while I got it, Porno Holocaust was a massive disappointment as it is just so damn boring. The title suggests that the movie will have porn and it's not wrong - Porn Holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most are just the same things over and over again, I was fast ahead of the end. The first sex scene is between two women, and I have hoped for that, but after that they only degenerate into normal porn and the rest of the movie (for the first hour!) Consists of talking and you can imagine where very funny, it is to sit through! The ground focuses on a deserted island, where, believe it or not, something strange happens. Of course, it is not long before a group of people - consisting of few men and some scientists, all of whom are random sexy women, land on the island. They have sex a couple of times and some strange things happen, and over an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies ... This must have seemed like a good idea to an original porn - a zombie, who likes to get it on, but surprisingly it doesn't work well at all. The movie looks into just ten minutes less than the two-hour mark, and it's too long for a movie like this. I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; If they had just cut a minute out of every sex scene, the movie would have been under ninety minutes and that would have made it much more acceptable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to be displayed (it is quite a long time before there is a sex break that is long enough to actually travel to the island at first) and when it finally looks like it is a huge disappointment! I realize this is low-budget B-movie garbage bin, but D'Amato could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this! I don't even mention the actor, the atmosphere, etc. There is no point. Porn Holocaust is basically just your average boring porn girl with a little sprinkling of horror and I can't recommend it!
