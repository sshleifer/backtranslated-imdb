Tom & Jerry visit Africa and indulge in an "Amos-n-Andy" fashion. They work themselves and speak differently with the standard degrading use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of black portrayed in many drawings of the era. Apart from the offensive pictures, this cartoon is just not very good. Why should they go to Africa in the first place? Apparently just to give the audience another Amos-n-Andy and the over-exploited cannibalistic portrayal of native Africans. The only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was a decent couple of seconds containing an octopus. <br /> <br /> Worth a view that will still leave you shaking your head and wondering how ignorance could prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I see some comics containing such racist stereotypical images, very well, it all depends on whether there is good content around the comic, or if the only reason for the existence of the comic is to make fun of those who are wrongly deployed. Get rid of "Mammy", mixed feet, are the poor grammar and black faces with huge lips pictures there something in the case of "Plane Dumb" is not.)
