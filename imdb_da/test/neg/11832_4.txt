"The death of a performer on a Broadway stage game brings together a theater critic and a policeman as an unlikely crime-solving duo. "The Phantom Killer" puts its view on the young woman as her next victim, so it's a race against the time of our heroes to catch the killer ", according to the DVD muffin's synopsis. <br /> <br /> Milton Raison's manuscript sets a small spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit. Helpful, Dave O'Brien (like Anthony "Tony" Woolrich) is in the lead; His acting as an actor seems to be much larger than the productions that use him. O'Brien and cab driving sidekick Frank Jenks (who Egbert "Romeo" Egglehoffer) would have made a fine 1950s television detective team. The leading lady Kay Aldridge (like Claudia Moore) and the supportive caste are also good. Unfortunately, the story becomes meandering and anti-climactic. <br /> <br /> **** Phantom of 42nd Street (5/2/45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
