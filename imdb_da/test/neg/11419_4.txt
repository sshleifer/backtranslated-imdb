Other than it reassembled the characters from the first movie and gave them more backstory. In essence, Lucian Lycan (werewolf) fell in love with Sonia the Vampire, a Romeo and Juliet scenario you know will end up bad if you've seen the first movie. So with absolutely no excitement, we blunder forward with two hours of unremitting CGI and low or no screen presence actors. All shot in the monotonous color that the first movie had because it was not shot in daylight. <br /> <br /> Worth your time .. probably not. In fact, the quality has dropped, although CGI looks like it was done on the cheap, you don't buy for a moment that these are real werewolves.
