At the Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the good goods, the Cheerleading team, will have lucky cheerleading teams with the 'hard' bad girl-cheerleading team The Demons to beat the stupid Falcon team that always seems to win in this camp I guess. This is a typical clich√©d '80s teenage (lame) sex comedy that you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for the sheer bloody horror. Oh and insanely bad dance tracks and the obligatory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (assuming that male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, remains with the camp of course). Just awful, forgettable, and unfortunately has a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My character: F (yup I gave it to them)
