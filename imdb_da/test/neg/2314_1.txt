1 hour and 40 minutes of talking - boring to talk and more to talk and saw some. It's hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who shone brilliantly in Femme Fatale, wanted to sign up for such a shit! Incredible. If you need a night coat, this movie can help even though I prefer some fine classical music. unfortunately I just found out that I have to write 10 lines for my comment to show up - it's almost as incredible! So brief and concise one or two sentence comments that express its core, take a movie, is not enough. geez, folks. I made my point and didn't waste your time with more unnecessary words - as this movie does. Wolfgang
