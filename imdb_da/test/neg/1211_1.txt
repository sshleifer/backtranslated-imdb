I wrote spoiler alert, but there is not much that can be spoiled. It's like destroying rotten meat. This movie is probably the worst I have ever seen. Not because of the actors or special effects, but because of the large number of errors, both factual and physical. First of all, the MIGs are not MIGs at all. They are Mirages and they are French. And how can Doug's father resist the maneuvers his son does to fight the "MIGs" without a g-suit? And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? And how could Doug defeat the enemy pilot with such ease? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 successors, the latest from as late as 1995. Now it's scary.
