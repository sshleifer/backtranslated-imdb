Oh how I laughed during the first few scenes. This stupid little movie about an 11-year-old carrying a gun, stealing cars, robbing shops, burglars, expelling money from other children, burning houses, shooting rats, buying drugs, distributing drugs to his mother and his friends, then killing one guy. What a great comedy! But it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. It was intended as a social drama. How can it be? The events in this movie are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4-year cartoon-induced immature fantasy. The dialogue is ridiculous; people speak like morons. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are actually very fun, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while, and after that comes the grinning rarely; at that time, the viewer cannot believe what he sees and alternately becomes astonished and bored with the following (if he has at least half a brain cell). A short film, but feels like an eternity. In fact, the film is a seriously intentional attempt to show the world of a young degenerate while imitating movies much better than that of "Fun". There is just such an air of phoniness about everything; the children, the adults, all lack credibility both in their actions and dialogue. The child in the lead is waging his way through the movie as if he had seen all the Jimmy Cagney movies at least a hundred times. And typically, the child is not portrayed as an evil reservoir, but instead as a misunderstood little artistic talent. But of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. Bad child. <br /> <br /> The movie is embarrassing; a collection of stale, occasionally hilarious cliches put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the movie is zero.
