I do not understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The eye-catching horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated. Me and my girlfriend just looked together and I'm not sure we will ever be able to get sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the frightening, unattractive cast, their overall unhygienic genitals, the rancid trying to humor, the screaming sounds being claimed to be songs ... No, I know what was worst of all. The girls in the green leotards, with green facial paints, lick Alice to dry her out and then, in broken childish speech, suggest that they provide milk from her breasts. It was the worst. What happened to the nurses, and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty awaken a dildo in the air and pretend it's his penis? Why should my eyes see this? There are no words.
