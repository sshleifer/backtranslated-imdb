I was forced to read this sappy "love story" between a German 24-year-old POW and a 12-year-old Jew. It has "political correctness" written all over. It's kind of like the movie "SPIRIT" where a horse will be free, but the "evil" Americans will not leave it because they need it. Now I have good news The Americans are "evil" in the German soldier and his summer book. Why!!! Horses given to us by God, and if Americans need a horse, you can use it. Likewise, the Germans had tried to kill Americans, but this book / movie makes it seem OK! Castings are absolutely terrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white father, it is probubly from mostly white lineage, and the little sister is "shirley templish." The action is also pretty bad, the serious parts become comedy! Concluson-Bad movie, bad book, but both have different endings, don't read or see one!
