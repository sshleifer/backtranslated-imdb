This includes some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth seeing at least ... Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be part of this debacle of writer-director Damian Harris is beyond me. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques that include going to a party with a suspect and inviting suspect to your house and becoming intimate with them. The story also has a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all. Even more over-the-top is the idea that the female victims of a horrible S / M crime belong to a large but secret group of S / M lesbian leaders. <br /> <br /> Full of bad editing and continuity errors, the movie is sterile in all its ritzy locations - including Barkin's detective pay apartment. And the lame dialogue is suitable for putting someone to sleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a poor writer and a poor instructor. He tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times. Moreover, he could not get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I firmly believe that she understood that the film was pathetic and stopped trying. <br /> <br /> Standouts were Peta Wilson who wasted time studying with a Dominatrix for that matter. The very underrated actress, Marshall Bell, gave his absolute best as always. <br /> <br /> And since Damian couldn't deliver at any level, it was hard to feel the emotions of any of the characters. <br /> <br /> Most importantly he doesn't know much about the real world of BDSM and chose to create the typical "Hollywood reality" of beautiful men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and braincells and pass it on.
