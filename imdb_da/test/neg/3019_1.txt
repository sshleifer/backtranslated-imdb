This is possibly the worst I have ever seen on television. First of all, I am quite sure that it takes quite seriously, and I tend to be quite good at recognizing satire. Secondly, it shows Aristotelian levels of chauvinism; In one of the ads it describes one of "playas" women in the form of "quality". Third, every participant I've seen on it (six I think) was a faint head of the variety who probably wants a Facebook with "BONING U" or "WOMEN" entered under "Here For". To rewrite Roger Ebert, this does not scrape the bottom of the barrel or deserve mention in the same sentence as barrels. The closest thing to a redeeming feature I have experienced with regard to the key to VIP was to have a female friend assure me that the male cast was actually the opposite of attractive, both physical and mental.
