The people of ABC forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor who played JPII was very stiff, there was no personality there. It is very very obvious that this film was at the bottom of the programming totem pollen, moving is so low budget. The script is terrible. Conversations like: "You must follow the rules" "No, the people are starving." Lame. Plus, the movie jumped like crazy from event to event to fit it into the two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to see a PBS documentary on JPII. CBS also puts a mini series on JPII that is better than ABC by far. JPII was a wonderful man and it bothers me to think that my grandchildren might get hold of this ABC movie and think it was what he really liked!
