!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of the TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I don't think Arnie's action / adventure movie is too much. They are better than his comedies with certainty, but it hardly says much. The problem I have with all of their action blockers is that they are overwhelmed and lacking in any morals <br /> <br /> Morality? In my review of TERMINATOR 2 I mentioned the scene where good guy Terminator blows the knee pads from the SWAT team. Should we think, because the hero makes people do their work instead of killing them, will we admire him in someway? This is the problem with ERASER when James Cann's character is revealed as a traitor within the American Marshal Department Arnyn's character John Kruger goes on the move with a witness he protects, but in several later sequences, Kruger kills a fairly large amount of marshals work with the villain. Should we take it, they were also all traitors? Surely many of them were honest men who tried to stop Kruger because the bad guy told them that Kruger was the traitor? It is a rather unpleasant thought that Kruger killed several people trying to maintain the law. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they cost a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not so impressive. Look at the scene where Kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute. It is obvious when the action talks about the fact that it is a stuntman who makes the free fall sequence, while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a movie that has unnecessary CGI with killer alligators, not just unnecessary CGI, but also convincing CGI. There are also a few plot holes that in the opening scene involve a few testimonies of people that the mob has caught up with. Kruger opens a car strain and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire, thereby throwing the scent off the scent. Kruger will be seen next time reshaping the dental papers via the couple's computer, he is rescued. It would be logical to do this, but would ALL pairs of dental records be stored on the computer? Most importantly, do we believe that the US Marshal Department holds a freezer full of organs for such events? So they go, a typical Arnie thriller long on unlikely to put pieces and shortly after intelligence and it is interesting to note that ERASER didn't make much of the cash at the cashier's office, as the cost of production almost offset a potential audience. After ERASER, Arnie did not do much more at the cashier office, as he saves to TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, which was an event film, and it will be interesting to see if he is remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
