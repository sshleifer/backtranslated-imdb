The English translation of the title of the DVD version of this movie is "Graveyard of Horrors", but I think it must be a mistake. It should have been called "Graveyard of Horribles." Terrible play, horrible editing, horrible story and horrible music make all this a horrible movie back in a terrible cemetery. Terrible.
