Although it can be very boring at times, this movie is really not that bad. The action is pretty well done, if stereotypical, and the production values ​​are quite high considering some of the Sci-Fi movies that came later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie is some of the very outdated characterizations in it. There is the guy from Texas, the "professional" scientist, and worst of all the women scientists who finally realize her femininity. For a movie that seeks to make a statement about humanity, it loses some of its influence by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
