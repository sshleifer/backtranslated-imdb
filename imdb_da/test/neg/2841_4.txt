(Some Spoilers) Blunt as bowl mushrooms that have this horrible homeless Harry, Darwyn Swalve, out to murder real estate agent all over the city of L.A because of the high prices they charge for their property rights. Looks like an extra from a Clint Eastwood "Spaghetti Western" Harry, who has lived in abandoned houses, eats dog food, is very worried where his entire lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted. This happens when a number of real estate agents invaded his room in an attempt to sell the houses that he is staying with their potential customers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom-of-barrel horror movie as radio talk show host Dr. David Kelly the beautiful and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is sued by the family of one of his callers, Tracy, who ended up blowing out her brains while in the air with the doc, who could not do anything to help her survive her trials to go to him. <br /> <br /> The real estate killer is going to speak to Dr. Kelly in the air about her adventures and the police are trying to get the docet to get her phone number and address by keeping him on the line, but he refuses to order not to hurt his rating by having potential calls not calling into fear of being watched by LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a hot and heavy affair with a property manager and agent, busty Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, whose sales office is Harry's biggest victim of his movie. Harry also gets to kill Lisa's biggest competition in the home business, the warm and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to put Lisa out of the business in any way, even if he was to kill her. <br /> <br /> Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry cuts off his head as he is entertained by one of his clients, a hooker whom he leaves dead and sticks to the head of Barney. The movie ends with the fake Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr. Kelly tries to get to her rescue just to have it. Shapiro (Robert Miano), looks like I haven't slept in a week, jumps out of nowhere and blows Harry's brains out. Harry quickly comes back to life minus the homosexual exam between his ears and is himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD, the M16 combed and ready, came on stage. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with the excitement ridiculously for almost non-existent. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not store the movie as there were too few, only two of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a little over-exposed, with not enough light and too much clothing in them all. <br /> <br /> Harry's murderer in the movie was also a bit comical to be taken seriously when trying to make a point to Dr. Kelly on the phone and in person about the high rents and real estate in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in. You can sympathize with Harry's concern over the high cost of living, but be very critical of for him in how he madly went about correcting it.
