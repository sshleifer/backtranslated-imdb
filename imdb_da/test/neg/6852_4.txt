This is a painfully slow story of the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and ... I stopped breaking myself. It is believed to be about two people living above or below each other in an apartment complex. There is a leak and a plumber puts a hole in the man's floor so you can look into the woman's sublime. Also, since there is a crisis going on much of the dialogue is actually news reports ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I was distracted and started doing other things that are fatal in a subtitle movie. Basically, I didn't start to look, which made the events more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It may work for you, it didn't do for me.
