I'm a big fan of the demonic dolls. Looking at the surface of this, it looks good! You have Decapitron, the dolls and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that makes this project to animate, inanimate objects, cannot act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. TOTEM. I would see it for 2 hours. But instead, the puppet roll is down, and the whole movie suffered because of it. The mysterious Skull guy who created the totem is at best corny, and the Decapitron look is long awaited, short and really quite disappointing. You would be better to see the first one again.
