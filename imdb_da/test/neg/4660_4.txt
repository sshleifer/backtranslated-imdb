I watched this movie about six years ago, and I did that recently. If I remember correctly, I didn't like it all the first time, and I appreciated it a little more this time. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is on a big budget. The effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two "influences") and the casting is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, the one who decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut would be fired. Being a Swedish and a fan of Peter, I am absolutely sure that he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is simple stupid, both respecting the lines that are spoken and the actor. So ... something should be wrong with the script. I'd like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut instead. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to see. It's a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch a breath. In addition, the events that unfold are simply not credible. I would like to see a much more sensible and shortened version of this part of the movie. Finally, the scenes involving flying spaceships are for action-oriented. The races move as if they were a pair of MIGs, with no safety distance, while jumping out of car size ice cubes as ping-pong balls. The director should see Apollo 13 to learn about spacecraft restrictions like these. <br /> <br /> I like the music track because it is dramatic to an extent that makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. Apart from the above things, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With some minor changes, it would have been an 8/10 movie. I'm sorry it's not!
