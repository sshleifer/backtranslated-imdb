As someone who loves movies that appeal to intellectual sorties and those who just tell stories, this movie should have been appealing. But, as written and directed by Catherine Breillat, who seems to play his own events in film-making experiences, this boring and talky film fails to arouse interest. The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is the screen of Breillat, an instructor frustrated in her attempt to film a compelling sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is the actor and Roxane Mesquida is the actor). One 'comic' piece is Jeanne's introduction of the use of a dildo attached to the actor to make her run the sex scene to pursue, but even though this view is thin fast and we are back with a movie in a movie that feels more like a 'deleted scene' featurette on a DVD than a solid French comedy with the class.
