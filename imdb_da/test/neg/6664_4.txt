Eh it is not as good as the other Dragonballs. The bad guys are actually rip-offs of other Z villains like Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. With Baby, Frieza's clone, Super 17 is Cells clone, and Shadow Dragons is Buu's clone (s). The story is also very bad as it is about shrinking Goku. Shrinking !! It's about him screaming to resemble the size of an eight year old just to get it started. Let's not forget how weak the signs are. Gohan can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sorry I know). Talking about Pan, she was so sweet at the end of Z now she has lost all the cuteness and becomes an annoying, whiny little girl whose only purpose in this series is to get in the way. The boy doesn't even have anything in the series and trunks ... well I don't know what to say about trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, avoid this series. It doesn't even feel Dragonball. I want to be fair, but as the end was really good and is actually quite sad (at least to me) and the theme songs ending and opening are better (Japanese, not American). Maybe it's been better if Toriyama San worked on it.
