It used to be that video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would release low-budget, shot-on-video horror movies for a selection of gorehounds who were delighted to eat them. It's acceptable to me because you could watch these movies from a mile away with their scary boxing art and cheesy titles. Now we have the Lions Gate into the mix, only they have decided that it would be better to suck in poor sap by putting a "professional" look at it and charging the same price as one of their higher budget, professionally made features . Don't be sucked into this! Allowed if you have seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3, but there is room for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf next to professionally crafted features. <br /> I'm a fan of independent cinema and have seen several low budget shot-on-video productions still a worthy rental, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen . The "acting" (if you can call it) was spooky. It was fun to laugh at the horrible line reading for a moment or two, but in the end it was too much to take and become unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, it seems to be even worse. The only possible saving grace for this would be a disemboweling scene that still manages to be horrible, but is an award-winning effect over blood splatters after a girl is beaten or mannequin decapitation. I took three tries to do it throughout this movie, and I only did that because I paid good money to rent it and felt that I should at least complete it all the way. Stay away - stay far, far away from this one.
