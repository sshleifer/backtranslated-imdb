Jaloux man holds car dealer hostages while Williams burdens the viewer with his worn Mork Shtick at every turn. Grass. <br /> <br /> Pay channel grist. An unusually bad script combined with a less than convincing Robin Williams as a slender chatter, philandering Queens car dealership was caught up in hostage warfare. The laugh is not there, the message or morality is just wrong, and the film can never decide whether it is a comedy or a drama. Pretty good cast everyone is doing pretty badly. When a movie ages so badly so fast, you've got a stink yourself. Not much else to say other than maybe, avoid at all costs. Textbook mediocre movies like this are actually more boring, and less enjoyable than those over the top bombs.
