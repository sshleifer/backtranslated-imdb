What Fox is fascinating with dysfunctional families, consisting of significant, unpleasant, pampered children and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being a parent? I'm sorry, I don't understand. The one episode that I could barely see was involving one of the children who demanded a Bar Mitzvah, to get thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, the idiot will decide that her precious little junior must have the largest and polluted party of all, and have no problem losing 20 grand on the big event. The ditzy, brain-dead, boy's crazy teenage daughter jumps back and forth between being Jewish and then Catholic, when she sees the "sweet" religious teachers. One borders "hearty" momentum throughout the episode, when a father's putt, convinced all the time, is that Bar Mitzvah is purely a money-making scheme, sees his son studying his Hebrew lessons, and instantly stupid Perhaps his insidious offspring is sincere about the right of passage in crew. This warm fuzzy feeling is immediately torn out of the chest when he informs the junior that since he has not yet had a breast, a certain "procedure" must be performed. Bar Mitzvah is denied and the mother is out thousands of dollars when the child refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is garbage and I'm sorry I never come back the 23 minutes my life I wasted so this shot because nothing else was on TV ...
