To be fair I didn't see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I do remember those who move it around on a weekly schedule. Some shows are just not worth following each week. But I really tried first so it wasn't that bad. Maybe I just kept expecting to improve it, but I can't give this show a 1. I honestly can't give it more than 2. It wasn't MASH (I'm not going to write those stupid *'s every time) . And it tried to be MASH without putting any effort as though it would just happen magically. Well guess what? No magic. The best thing I can do here is to compare it to other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. was a far better show far from it. But they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D., because Pernell Roberts looked like an older BJ, but not at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change the name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH, not the only successor was to completely bomb and lift the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame follow-up on All In The Family. It had no heart, no conflict, no depth ?? all the things that made everything in the family so memorable. Likewise, MASH was fun because the doctors responded to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and you remove the drive to 99% of humor. Potter can't shout at Klinger to wear a dress because Klinger doesn't wear a dress because he doesn't try to get kicked out of the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over. (breath) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer, to stay around and see the show. And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy, who just stand there unnaturally and face the audience as a trio of Vaudeville artists. It is reminiscent of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show behind that sofa and talked to the audience and tried to make it look like they had a natural conversation. They weren't. And it felt even less natural in After MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random tidbit I remember is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH really was a spin-off of the movie MASH (as they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf. I think studio execs will do something for a buck. Something else than doing a worthy successor, that is.
