It's probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of The War Room, who was a fantastic movie (albeit a little one-sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in a guy's cellar. The quality was so pitiful that I couldn't see it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateurish anything from anyone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did this win any awards initially ??? The war room definitely deserved a price, like another great documentary called Ameragosa (both won awards). This documentary looked like it was made by Uncle Joe, who also does weddings on weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, poor sound, a 10-year-old could make a better movie than the guy did.
