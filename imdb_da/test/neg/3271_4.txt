Perhaps, like most others who have seen this movie long after it is premiered on television, I would see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what 'Slow Burn' is. Except for the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, employed by a Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), a wealthy artist, to investigate where he was with his foreign son, Brian, who had lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) the last few years. In a Phillip Marlowe-esquire fashion, Jacob Ash tells what is more than just a study of Brian's residence. But when Jacob tracks down Laine, his discoveries break up a lot of trouble. Perhaps because the events in the movie are moving too slowly, there is never much excitement on this little thriller, not even in the end with the final routine of revealing the sinner and their motives. But as mentioned before, this movie is probably one that will attract the attention of the then relatively unknown cast of actors, which includes both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the sweetness Johnny Depp, who plays Laines actor, Donnie. It may be reason enough to try it ... if you can find it.
