When I bought this movie, I expected to be fun, 1970s movie. Instead, I got this drill party by amateur writer Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With its tight editing, breakneck pacing and wonderfully well-known actors, you will almost believe you see ... one of his home movies! Seriously, I couldn't even be awake the first time I tried to see it. The scenes from boring people dragged on one, and when someone was killed, the film would lower. Sometimes it will also increase speed, so the characters are sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script actually seemed a little better than the movie, and seems more suited to being in a soap opera than in a grainy 70s sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble upon it. The cover said "Your primary cuts were curious erotic ... but thoroughly brutal!" Believe me, there is nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we'll see signs that look like extra lumpy cottage cheese, but it's about it. And as far as "brutal", the viewer is most brutalized with this movie. And another thing ...
