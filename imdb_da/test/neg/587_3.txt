Wow, well, you know the shocking things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hours in total to see because I had to take a break and restart my brain for semi-normal functionality so often. I think this movie goes soooooo slooooow it is ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue that would be generous. They just don't speak !! And while you're talking, it's not all, and I admit there were some scenes where only the music was needed, and the music is great, it was probably the best, but then you have to listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie . So many people give these amazing reviews, and in my time I would say that the special effects and filmography are quite good, but in terms of the play or lack thereof, it just needed a little more, no shootem ups or sex, etc. It is not necessary that there is nothing, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sat there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to reassure yourself, just play the movie, don't even start at first, if you've seen it before, just start somewhere, sit down and relax, it gets you to sleep .
