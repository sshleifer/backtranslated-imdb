I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing as it does not catch any of the tastes or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry and unclean elements. The film was dull, boring, completely incoherent from start to finish, pretentious and without any imaginable plot. You had to be mentally following the plot line or lack of it. It certainly had its moments; But it also goes to the dentist. In short, I would much rather endure another colonoscopy before I see this horrible mess again. It was so bad I couldn't actually fall asleep. There are quite a few "Eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the bright side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the only saving grace in this movie. <br /> <br /> Disturbing was also the cruel wild boar depicted in final credits. A wild boar released on someone else's property (Malta has very few native mammals, all small - rats, bats, etc.) and then put on dogs before it was shot. Oh, go - visit Malta anyway despite this movie - it's a beautiful colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.
