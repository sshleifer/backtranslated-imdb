Telly Savalas put on an acceptable (but not better) performance like Pancho Villa, the infamous Mexican bandit / revolutionary in this story of Villa's raid on the city of Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. Villa is not really a historic figure as I do. is too familiar with, so I will not say much about the film's historical details. As a movie it is not good, even if it has a smattering here and there with both action and humor. Chuck Connor's performance as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US Army base near Columbus hit me a little over the top, and Clint Walker as Villa's Gringo sidekick Scotty didn't do much for me. The film is of course a rather low budget effort of limited technical quality. For a movie with a runtime of just over an hour and a half, I have to say that this movie is drawn in places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. Villa raid in the US was an interesting (if in the overall system of things, not particularly important) historical sidebar, and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4.10
