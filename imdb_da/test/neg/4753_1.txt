This item does not contain spoiler. It doesn't have to. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element of the first Alien movies was the excitement that something could happen. This was so in the first two Predator films, but less widespread. Requiem has completely removed the tension element and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people should die (well, duh, it's an AVSP movie), but you know who to die and when to die and where to die before it happens. The executives have to take a lesson from Hitchcock who said, "Suspense is not a time bomb that goes under a table. Suspense is a bomb NOT under the table." What is the point of going into a movie when you know exactly what should happen and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out to video and then download it, but by no means will I buy it.
