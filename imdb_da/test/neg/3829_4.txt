Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor, gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unauthorized drug, resulting in patient death. Without a job, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she tends to be a wealthy brother's white landowner. The brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in local voodoo practices and rituals. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror flick. The action is rather boring, plot twists are stupid and there is no tension. There is a bit of gore as a person kills off white people with a machete, but not too much. Cinematography is decent, but the play is really sad. Finally, avoid.4 out of 10.
