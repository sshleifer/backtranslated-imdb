The most entertaining parts of this movie were the rocks from the original movie. The act was poor, and the precondition for sexual scorecards was disgusting. The effects were, at best, marginal. There were no appearance performances, Amy Irving was put into this movie to try to get a share of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more enjoyable and pleasing. I am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the 10 best years ... so far it is at the bottom of my list. Don't bother with this one people !!
