This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write it, produce it, fix it, etc. The only reason I ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. How many times can Norris fly through the air from ordinary sight to land a kick on a apparently blind villain? No trees, no building, just whoosh ..... thin air. He ALWAYS solves the issue or is the best, no matter what skill. No co-star ever gets honor. Its all Norris. It is quite clear that Norris is terribly stuck on herself and will not allow anyone to behave in any scene whatever the content. Terrible play, horrible script, horrible series.
