Okay, let me start by saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come by. Your computer didn't tell you every step of your mission you could walk and explore. <br /> <br /> It's the first thing wrong with RL, all you do is under a schedule and run by other people. I mean, shouldn't you as a leader be telling people how to handle every single mission? <br /> <br /> And when talking about missions, why are they interspersing the original trilogy with completely created crap? Never mind. <br /> <br /> I was so waiting for this game when I heard they should allow you to fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think anyone who is a fan of the movies wanted to do this. So, they give it to you. It's the stupidest level in the game. You start by flying through the asteroid field with tie chasing after you, and your whole goal is to move further into the field as you hit the bands. You have to kill them all to move on. Hey, remember how many He killed when he was in the field? No one, they all had bad pilot skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to escape the asteroids when they came to me, but instead I have to use my automatic target guns to kill ties behind me. It was the biggest disappointment you have no control over your flight is all sluggish. All except the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. But, oh yes, didn't he say the Falcon was? Anyway ... You finally come to the Battle of Endor. Here is the ultimate level you will destroy the star of death, everyone's first instinct is to choose Falcon and be the leader. But of course you get there and have to do stupid pre-selected strategies like finding (not to mention explaining the difference between) the tie bombs. This is impossible in the falcon as you have seen a group of frigates being destroyed. The only way to get past this part is to choose A-Wing. Then you must attack the star's destroyers and it's a really stupid chore. This game makes you feel like you are the only one who defends the insurgency. When you get frustrated through the 'fun' fight, you come to the death star. And here you may think 'yay! I'm going to destroy the star of death, and again, as in the Asteroid field, you need to do something boring while narrowly passing the tunnels of impending death. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remembering it from the return of the Jedi? It's so moronic, because if you choose the falcon, you will die because you are not maneuverable, but if you choose the x-wing, keep the lock and unlock your s-foils. So it's a choice to either kill the evil ones or try to catch up with Lando, who apparently doesn't know how to maneuver. Thus the process dies. <br /> <br /> The bonus steps are not even worth aiming for, as each level becomes increasingly frustrating. It makes me feel the way I did when I saw the new three movies disturbed and needed to kill something. Lucky for me, smash bros melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope with the Wii they come up with something much better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity. I will sell this game the first chance I get.
