The discussion has been held a thousand times. Is "Merchant of Venice" Anti-Semitic? (I think it is.) Isn't it unfair to always point out this little bit of anti-Semitism in an otherwise great piece of art? (I don't think so.) Does this spot play Shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (I think it does.) Is it a role if he didn't do it on a particular racist purpose? (I don't think so.) Michael Radford knew all this and therefore he added the film a prologue about the Jews' pitiful situation in the Renaissance Venice. In vain; for the game remains what it has always been, and the new make-up gives only a first (but meaningless) hope that someone has dared to put something right that remains a permanent outrage, not because its degree of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking, but because the game comes under William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying hatred for a man - Shylock? Why hire a big and serious actor like Al Pacino if everything ultimately gets destroyed in this outrageous (but hi, I'm non-responsible-Shakespeare-written) courtroom scene. And now I want to be very precise, like Shylock himself. He demands his right, according to the contract, which - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always used to look down on him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Certainly, what Shylock requires is cruel and useless, but it's not the intention. What we see (or should see) is a man who has been humiliated for his entire life, to the point where everything left on him is his hatred. I think it is certainly a little inappropriate to embarrass such a man on things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the play / movie (they are one now) does at this time ... become a soap opera! The cruel maniac with his knife, the terrible (but rather concise) audience, the poor "victim" bound to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate, but why can't he just say a word, "sorry"? I think we don't have to lose many words on the ridiculous judgment of the young Dottore from Padua; It is a truly "popular judgment" that is not very different from what would be seen 400 years later in the Nazi show attempt. From one minute to the next, this Jew is robbed of everything he owns, doomed to be christened Christian and kicked out. Isn't it outrageous ??? Obviously not. The story goes on to the romantic intricacies of the rings and the happy end. <br /> <br /> What you can learn in Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin and similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the mass because what is so devastating to a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority. It should be just about everybody's job to develop a sensitivity to detect and mask such trends. <br /> <br /> I don't accept the excuse that this movie was made to create empathy with the ill-treated Shylock (it just doesn't work). I don't think anyone can be compelled to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; especially not for an Oscar.
