I'm not sure who has more fun, the people who wrote reviews or the movie director. I could no longer read these comments or watch this movie I had to say. <br /> <br /> I can see a low-budget Western movie made with passion and interest in the details, but using a garage with art deco letters, pastel colors, actors, appearing to be falling asleep because The manuscript is so boring and the boom comes in the way of the camera every two scenes, it is certainly not my definition of "one of the best western films produced in the new millennium". <br /> <br /> If any of the guys had friends in the movie, just say it!
