I can only mention a few movies that I have seen, which was so bad. This film has horrible everything: The dialogue is corny and clich√©, the play is mostly poor, with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to celebrate, and the plot is stupid. A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't do the football team). It's so bad it's fun to see. If you can capture this at lifetime, I would highly recommend it as a comedy. Regarding being a serious movie, I'm afraid I'll have to judge this one 2. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you're a serious movie fan looking for an interesting and challenging history, or good acting. There is no one to find. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people working for life must have written some fake reviews and voted down all the negative ones. Don't believe them. This is a really crappy movie.
