Sometimes, on purpose, campy, sometimes unintentionally silly (as in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been raped and that the family has been slaughtered just for the sake of exposure), this movie is not fun either. enough or competent enough (as a fair tale story) to be really fun. I allow you to decide what may be the highlight, but the low point is probably the battle with a silly metallic dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her fresh face and her firm, slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair fits her perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances like Calidor.
