Much can usually be forgiven during periods that ask us to remember important historical events and spice them with enough love to keep the story going. BRAVETS BRAVE tackles the 18th century's struggle for control of Quebec (all of Canada) between the British and the French with sidebars from New America. It's a fascinating epic fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of the author Pierre Billon (whose script deserves a Razzie prize for worst season) and the scattered, unfocused and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin, this movie is a dud - a two and a quarter times boring mess in a movie. Even a cast of actors - mating Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur and adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu as Le Curé Thomas Blondeau and Irène Jacobs Vincent Perez (ridiculous in periods of periods), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolfe - do not help Veteran actors like these to have cringed on the raw lines written for their characters! Cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by Patrick Doyle, and the result is a long movie to avoid. Sad to say so bad things about an expensive project, but be warned .... Grady Harp
