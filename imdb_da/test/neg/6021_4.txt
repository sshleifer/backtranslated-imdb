"Clubbed" is another "will-this-do?" Access to the Brit Fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who don't expect too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. But for anyone looking for intelligent, quality entertainment, it really is avoided. <br /> <br /> There are so many misnomer in the horrible script that even a caliber actor of Colin Salmon is left to see daft. The action is set in the 1980s, but it is never clear why, especially when they have not been able to draw a convincing feeling in the decade - it takes more than a couple of 80's soul records on the soundtrack, the occasional zoo suit and a handful of year old cars. Then we see key figures studying texts like Sun Tzu's "The Art Of War" and talking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem to be too willing to begin wiping out battles with all the testosterone - burnt, thoughtless surrender of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> Character development is not found in "Clubbed". It also does not irony, subtlety or pathos. This is a film about good memories of Guy Richie's early gangster movie, which despite their shortcomings certainly had much more joke, better editing, snapping dialogue and packing more emotionally than this light little story. They're a decade old now, anyway - isn't it time we continued to try to imitate them?
