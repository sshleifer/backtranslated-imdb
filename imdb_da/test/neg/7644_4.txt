SILVER CITY (2+ over 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles' work for many years, I feel safe to say that this is the worst movie he has ever done. That said, the movie isn't exactly * horrible * ... just very uninspired. Sayles throws in familiar elements from his earlier films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, sale of youthful ideals), but fails to bring them together in a new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time. It sounds cliched and forced into almost every scene. The movie looks and sounds like episodes from a television series that didn't make it past its third episode. There are lots of big stars at your fingertips ... and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive ... but the material just isn't here this time. While a campaign spot is being taken, a governor-hoping (a poor and blatantly George W Bush stand) fishes a dead body out of a lake. An investigator is hired to try to warn people who may have deliberately created this to discredit the candidate ... but he quickly finds out that there are deeper and darker (and more clich√©) secrets to being discovered. Sayles has made similar theme films so much better earlier ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "Return of the Secaucus Seven", "Men with Guns"). It's a pity that he went to the well once too many and came up with the hassle of water. A good line, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser. It's already established without a doubt. So just try being good, okay?"
