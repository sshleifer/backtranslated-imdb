"Patriot" staring Steven Segal is a late 90's thriller / action movie that is not a thriller and not an action movie. Rather, it is Steven Segal who plays Steven Segal with a different name, but this time he is an Indian national doctor who kicks ass every time. Baring the obvious plot line holes, the movie itself is absolutely stunning in terms of blatantly ignoring the character devolvement. <br /> <br /> From a market point of view, I was left to ask myself, "Who in the world were they targeting?" The bio-thriller plot line is far from the mark of Central America's crowd and Segal as a silk cowboy would never sell to anyone, even if you deeply fried him and put him between a kripsy-cream donut. The whole movie is just out there, even for Segal fans, because it simply doesn't deliver at any level.
