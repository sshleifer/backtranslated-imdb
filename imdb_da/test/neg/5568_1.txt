Really! Here, the French cinema hits the rock bottom and compared to it, the least appealing of the American young horror films, which "Friday the thirteenth" "Freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <It's all the more disturbing as there were exciting original elements: Forêt de Brocéliande and its legends, the druids and King Arthur, all were great assets for a dreamy fantasy and horror movie. The film, which a user pointed out in a fake forest, near Paris, is the film false horror, fake Celtic history, fake vestiges - you must see the professor (Wilms, who was a wonderful M.Le Quesnoy in "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille"). ) screaming for the "priceless scrap" - as the production probably bought in a dime bugs, fake excavations ... The boys disguised as druids are inadvertently very funny, these are also the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts. can we say about the professors? of a monster? A ten-year-old would write a better manuscript than this grotesque farce.Thinking that people can spend money on such drift when artists are still waiting for a producer! Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a wonderful story of druids and ancient ceremonies in his Arsene Lupine saga called "l'île aux trente cercueils." A miniseries were made 30 years ago. At this "Broceliande" waste and try to see it instead.
