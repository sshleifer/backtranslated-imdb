This movie has quite literally not a redemption function. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script looks like it was paved from 100 other movies, the play is terrible, and some of the "gross humor" made me feel nauseous. Shame on you, Gregory Poirier, for thinking some of this would be fun or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen for years.
