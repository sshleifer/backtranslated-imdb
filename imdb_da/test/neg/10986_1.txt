This is the worst movie I've seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago - without athleticism. Thus, I mean a few striking, artistic images, appearing randomly without any persistent frames. The fake sepia-colored film is really sticky. This device is almost never justified and is certainly not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: You can fool some of the people some time.
