I blame The Comebacks for anyone who enjoys Date Movie and Epic Movie. You encouraged people to the Fox studio to continue eradicating desperate parody films, and now we are faced with what may just be the stupidest and most desperate of them all. Comebacks hardly qualifies as a parody. Heck, it hardly qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved in this mess, might have fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something really miserable here. <br /> <br /> The reason, if you can even call it, is centered on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Just as I heard his name within the first few seconds of the movie, I knew I was in a long movie. Funny names are rarely fun and become even less fun the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he has another chance of his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), to train a ragtag high school football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them how inspiring sports movie clichés can work. He expects his children to have bad grades and problems with alcohol and ridicule them when they do not. When it seems that the team has a chance to play at the big championship Toilet Bowl game (Have 10-year-olds written this script?), Lambeau is shocked to find that Freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team will play against. Turns out Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to take the coaching job because he wanted Comebacks to lose. Comebacks is a movie that is so forced and pathetic that I almost had difficulty believing what I was watching. Spooffilm has recently become a "spot the movie reference" game, and it continues the tradition. It tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as possible, but it doesn't matter to them, expecting that we just point to the screen and laugh at the confidentiality, or it is trying to be fun and fall flat on its face. Some of the films mentioned include Dreams Field, Bend it as Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Light, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait, wasn't Dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? So in other words, we look at a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies. If that makes sense to you, you're just the audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these movies are featured in the plot, and some (such as Rocky One) are just thrown in for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to refer as many movies as possible. There are some whom the film itself feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue just if we missed the obvious reference. You know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell our own jokes to us. The worst thing is that the manuscript of TV veterans and first-time writers, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, don't do I don't know the first and most important parody rule - You have to play it right. The actors have to pretend they are not in the joke. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers movies like Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are so boring is because they throw serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes he was a serious actor before coming to comedy) and Robert Stack, and then Threw them in ridiculous situations. What made it fun is that they acted like they were not in a comedy and held a stone society to the weird ones around them. These movies would not have worked if they played their roles widely. Comebacks proves this when all the actors are forced to play their roles so stupid, it's as if they are screaming for us to laugh. David Koechner continues to clap his arms and bends his eyes and screams at the top of the lungs to the point he looks like a person who knows he is trapped in a dead-end comedy, and just tries too hard to pretend he is feel good . The film also does not understand the knowledge of cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody films). What kind of comos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> At the time of the movie throwing in an out of nothing and extremely pointless cast musical number for Journey's "Do Not Stop Believing" for absolutely no reason, I just went ready to leave the theater door . I was the only person in my screening, and the idea of ​​this movie is pathetic in a completely empty house that appealed to me. I sat through the rest of The Comebacks and I was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is, Fox has not yet finished killing the spoof genre. They have a parody of 300 coming out next year called Meet the Spartans. I would say that it can't be much worse than this, but I've seen the trailer and I wouldn't have hoped for it.
