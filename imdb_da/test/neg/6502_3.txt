Let me first say that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not "get" new art. That said, this movie is absolutely wild and, in my opinion, not wild in a good way. Avida is a movie for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting." The only reason I give this movie a 3 out of 10 is because I actually managed to laugh at some parts, even though it primarily laughs at the film's purity. Two of the characters throw trust on a lawn, to do what these characters did, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
