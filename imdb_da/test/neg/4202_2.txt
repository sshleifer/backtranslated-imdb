This is a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable! Plus the low budget shows great time! Some of the battles were good, but the story is ridiculous and there were no scary villains at all. The dialogue was ridiculous. I had some trouble completing this movie, but Chuck Norris made it a little tolerable. I really have nothing more to say since I only paid half the attention because it was so incredibly boring, but it took a little up towards the end. The direction is horrible. Don Hulette does a terrible job here with miserable photography, a terrible pace, and generally saw the movie dull! There are none. The action was horrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicks that ass and he made the movie almost tolerable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock is horrible as the biggest villain and very convincing. Terry O'Connor is decent here and had okay chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall, it is simply AVOID! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves it from BOMB rating).
