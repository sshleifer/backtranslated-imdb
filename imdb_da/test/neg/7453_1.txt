You know, I was very surprised when I saw this movie. It aired during the day once when I was sick, and I had nothing else to do, I continued to watch. This is by far the worst movie ever! But to my surprise I watched. I sat there and said this is terrible, but still the channel didn't change because I was so amused at how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like Big tom from survivors or the terrible mustaches and mohawks these characters had that kept me in mind. However, the girls were not half bad, but if that is what you want it is much better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" So if you like the ninja's bad acting, hilarious (and horrible) dialogue and two twins who are five meters long and kill everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. It's so bad, it's good. But I had to give it a 1 out of ten. I couldn't have put 10 on it up there with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!!!!!! :)
