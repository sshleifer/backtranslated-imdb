So many bad reviewers, it made me wonder what people think while watching a simple flick made by a pretty bad instructor ??? Have you all expected a super-hit flawless movie ?? No way you can already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-star film ... All his previous works where multi-starrers, but none were flawless. Take the first Jaani Dushman for example, so many mistakes, but still good fun. In any case, the film adheres, the film Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake that can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) who claims the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who caused it. It's pretty good, with a big cast. But I think it could have been much better. For example, take the script, can't say its flawless. For example, Take Ages: <br /> <br /> Have 40-48 year olds still been studying at university? <br /> <br /> There are many more, I don't want to list anymore, but there are dozens more. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **. 75
