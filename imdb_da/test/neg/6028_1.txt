I have also been a wife of a violent man, although the attacks in my situation were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to all who saw us together, which, unlike myself, resulted in others treating me as boring and unstable. In the beginning, I was so incredibly smashed that someone like Gus (who worked in a bank and was quite confident) would give me time of day, and I totally fell over for his IDEA rather than the person he was. If I had had my head straight and understood him much better first, there is no way I would have married him. But that's my fault. It was not my fault to be abused. I did not deserve that, and I did not see it until I was involved in mental play, criticism and isolation. He acted as if I had no business with a meaning different from his own - in fact, he went on. If I did not agree, he assumed that I misunderstood and increasingly simplified his wording ... when I finally lost my self-respect, I was unable to recognize the difficulty I was in and I had to be hit by reality by external influences. My father said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was another six months before the anger that began at that moment finally exploded and I packed some things while he was at work and I went. .. and it was another months before I could understand the fact that I was being abused and that it was not my fault that he did the things he did. ..... thank you, anyone who assumes it's the victim's fault, think !!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner, when in a nervous situation have an accident on the carpet, do you blame the puppy? When the abuse in a relationship reaches an overtly violent level, the objective of abuse has become so wounded and depersonalized (as in Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstances accurately, in which case the victim believes all the terrible things spew abuser. Have a heart, people. Labeling abusive victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who's already terribly beaten. -------> and this helps how ???
