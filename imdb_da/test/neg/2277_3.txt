Boring, completely predictable soap opera. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and does not know about the cheat. Danson dies in an accident, and Lahti is pregnant with her baby. YAWN! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I paid money to see this in a theater in 1986. I liked all three stars, but even their significant talents couldn't pull this out. I knew pretty much what would happen. As another poster said - this plays as a PG-rated Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> At one point in time, Lahti swears an oath, and even Moore lets loose once! There is also a pointless shot of topless women playing football (!!!). Apart from that, it's TV-friendly. The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs, who played Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very nice and a good actor. That there is nothing to recommend this. You've seen it before ... and done better. Of course it has been forgotten. Skip it over.
