I suppose this is in the public domain as it is out on DVD. First of all, it is an emotional propaganda film to be shown to a wartime Aussie audience, so it should not be considered a serious tale of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 are very dry things in Australia, I think like many American war movies, where the recruits come together, oh that is so long. But we come to Africa and Tobruk, pretty bad, low budget stuff. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I was watching were almost entirely black. See it if you need to, but be prepared to use it fast as I doubt you can take it after a few minutes. I enjoyed the Osteo-Italian Italian "Battle of El Alamien" much more, also Richard Burton made an African theater war flip which was good "The Desert Rats". This movie is just a real time and should have stayed in that time, not doing well today (I doubt it was too high then). I say the same about my US counter-war flicks, so don't personally take Aussies (I love Australia, have been there twice!).
