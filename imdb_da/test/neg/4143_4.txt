I wanted the dog this movie, but somehow I can't find it in myself to do it. <br /> <br /> Showing a duality of fighting styles, it is Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent fight for supremacy. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where the story carries the performances. Li's plays are extremely amateurish, hesitant and stiff for most of this movie ... right up to the end. First, I wondered to myself that he just did it for one of his two characters. You know to show a difference in personalities. But it seemed to be inexperienced or lacking in talent. It got a little better, more relaxed towards the end. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jet Lis's plays improve as his career moves forward. I don't hate his acting. I just hated him in this. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effects were very "B" class effects. What are the effects. <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, movie quality and some plays, or the director didn't care to break with these little details. He also did not disturb SCIENCE in science fiction. A fact that was a great propensity for this movie. The fighting sequences were a little one-sided as he seemed to give more to a character and small to the other. But all of it made the story a very enjoyable attempt. <br /> <br /> As fun as it was, I couldn't help thinking about it all, this was just one of the movies you can't help but watch it for what it is should have been, rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> It puts a 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It's a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) to have a good plot from ... <br /> <br /> Enemy :.
