This movie is horrible. A real hockey fan would have to assume that the people who appeared in and produced this movie never played or looked at a real hockey game. I was hoping it would be a "movie", but the only ones likely to enjoy this movie are women aged 13-17. Hockey scenes are horrible, defenders play as they are 5 years old, goalkeepers dive into shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie though !! For those who have seen it, who would have guessed ?? For those who haven't seen it, don't waste your time! <br /> <br /> I figured it less than halfway through the movie. Calling this movie is a drama ridiculous !!
