Now I love bad old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Dinosaurs Planet is as bad as a bad movie can get. The case has no actors, and only an attractive woman who they kill for two minutes after swimming in shore. There are literally no redeeming qualities found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing that was not wasted was paper ... the manuscript should not have been more than four pages long. Certainly no real WROTE dialogue this pointless. I am constantly amazed that such films have ever been made, much less published. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this waste of time. It's 75 minutes in my life, I'll never come back.
