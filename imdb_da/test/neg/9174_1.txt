"First Snow" has an exciting beginning. A travel dealer has his fortune told by an old man whose predictions turn out to be incredibly accurate. From this point on, the movie plays like an inflated episode "Twilight Zone". I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, taking into account the well-being of others for his own paranoia sake. The end is particularly weak, with absolutely no payout for the long suffering audience. Do yourself a great favor and avoid this. Not recommended. - NOTE
