Yesterday I watched this television production, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I didn't have great expectations as it was a television production, but the complete movie was painless. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was sad. Every minute was a long struggle and I struggled really hard to stay away from the "switch off" button. The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets many AIDS patients and most of them die during the film. It is difficult for Verghese to live with so his family is punished with his frustrations. But this movie has trouble displaying both sides, it focuses mainly on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flicks from his home, but we don't get much. The difficulty of showing more than part of Verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor who act from Naveen Andrews, a man I (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies. <br /> <br /> I think it was 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on this topic on the market. Stay away from this movie, it deserves no more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
