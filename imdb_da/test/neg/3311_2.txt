The only reason anyone remembers this steaming load of fecal matter is because it was scored by Pink Floyd. (Or, as they were known, "The Pink Floyd.") Stefan, a very annoying Eurotrash hitchhiker, picks up the American model Estelle, and they continue to be tall and naked throughout the movie ... <br / > <br /> And the point of this is what exactly? That drugs are bad? Or is only heroin (horse)? The problem is that you don't give a shot to the characters, and of course Pink Floyd wasn't up to their best work. When Steffan overdoses at the end, you're almost happy to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
