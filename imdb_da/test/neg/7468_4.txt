I saw Grande Ecole at world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was entering, and if I had any idea, I would not have entered. This is the most pretentious movie I've seen for a long time. It is trying to be provocative, yet deep, with its full frontal gay sex scenes - it doesn't succeed! It's just another bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4.10
