Fatal Contact: Bird flu in America: 3 out of 10: This movie is both fun and sad. The fun part is quite obvious as it certainly is not a sober look at a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And just as the killed bees (and the so-called killer bi-crisis that has caused them), bird flu has joined a pantheon of media-inspired end of world scenarios (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming), which simply refuses to actually come. /> <br /> The sad part is the blatant attempt by filmmakers to inspire panic. Disease pandemics were historically quite common, since all people did not all die in their four series from heart disease. Even recent pandemics like AIDS reflect the old-fashioned CEO crisis (Think Syphilis) that used to kill more soldiers than bullets. The influenza pandemic at the beginning of the twenties was a scary business that killed millions but honestly was life on it. I wonder if our over dramatic media and their power of hungry government allies would allow life as normal today. <br /> <br /> The movie itself floats wildly from pretty competent scenes (Triage in Grand Central Station) to the ridiculous (Redneck's experimental scenarios themselves are pretty useless, as the filmmakers can't seem to determine exactly how contagious the bird flu is or, if so, whether the symptoms are an Ebola style crash or simply a long illness, in fact, a scene will show everyone in biological color solutions, and the next will not even have anyone wearing a mask. practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. (Without washing your hands, what is no tape?) The action and control is competent for a TV movie, but the script is all over the card. Total non-exponential death running at the bottom of the screen, just as the swarm did.
