I got to know ÆON back in the early 90s via TV, and I loved it ... What did you like about it? The curved drawing style? The flawless artistic act involved? The absurd and deadpan communication between the characters? The whole layout of the surrounding future world? Whatever you loved about it ... The Aeon Flux movie at the end of 2005 has none of it. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the movie, was hopelessly overloaded with transporting the original content to a new movie. If you are not familiar with the original series, you do not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is opaque, and the stupid characters do not develop under the film. <br /> <br /> Kusama's attempt to improve the story by implementing some weak explanatory conversations between the protagonists is not only a huge attempt to cover her mistakes as it tells, it's simply unworthy of the original ÆON concept. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron may be an attractive woman, but she cannot unfold the AON character. Although attached to strings that made action scenes, her lack of physical movement talent simply destroys the action sequences of the movie. The result is a huge amount of hectic cuts to cover the purity of her physicist. <br /> <br /> Forget about the rest, it's not worth talking about ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point for Ms.Theron showing her breasts and 1point for the fine architectural photography in the movie. That is it.
