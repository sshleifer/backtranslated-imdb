I am really amazed that this got 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign films on the Oscar. 7.3 rating on IMDb ... it is not so surprising to see how IMDb users recently voted. I just can't get into a movie where the actual fact about the protagonist is clearly distorted, and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. As it turns out, it actually makes very boring for anyone who expected to see a serious and credible interpretation of Genghis Khan's life. The removed and overdramed Mongol often repeats those as 300, a movie that could not be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, Mongol takes seriously. It's stoic seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, it really makes it the most boring movie I've seen this year; possibly the most action or biopic movie I've ever seen. The characters were pathetically written. Honestly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this movie. Which is fun for me, because if there is something that I think should be changed for the sake of the theater, it makes a boring person into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Gone is also boring, simple and stupid. Even without giving anything away, Mongol contains the only stupid scene I've seen in a long time - where there should be a good 20 minute plot development, the film just pops out without any explanation. It looked like something out of a Saturday Night Live shit that parades epic action movies with horrible pacing. (Did I mention how serious Mongol is taking care of itself?) Meanwhile, it's like no movie I've ever seen before. Even now I could swear it was three hours long. About 45 minutes into it, I checked the time and was pretty sure it was almost finished. Besides some beautiful scenes and quality that appear from Asano (naturally), Mongol is honestly just a disaster. It did not manage to entertain me or inform me anyway. I would never give this movie a chance again. And not to sound racist or patriotic or anything, but give me a blurry and thoughtless American epic over Mongol some day. At least I know what I get, unlike Mongol, where the reviews and reviews led me to think it was actually worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The scary thing about how much I hated Mongol is what I have friends that I know without a doubt would just love it.
