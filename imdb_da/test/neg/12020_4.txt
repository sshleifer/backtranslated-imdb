and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (containing the first two "Problem Child" on a disk), and we decided to see the sequel because it was "more fun". <br /> <br /> There were many fun moments in the movie (vomit scene, that's all I have to say.), Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN, and many others. The movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's fun. However, apart from the fun moments, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter irritates the villain because of what he reads from a book. The man can't act in this, sorry. Although I can't tell if I would find the movie fun now ... (we were blown when we saw it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day ... but nothing else. Don't expect Oscar material on this one, guys.
