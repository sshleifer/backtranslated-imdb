I like the 50s sci-fi movie a lot. I like the really good ones (like The Day, Earth still stood when the world collides, Invasion of Body Snatchers and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really fun and good to see with friends (such as plane 9 from outer space). But when a sci-fi movie is bad, but not bad enough to be fun, it should really be avoided. This movie is just such a movie. The posters make it seem like a kind of sexy she-beast is attacking humanity, while the real plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and begins to grow to a large size and decides to track this worm and kick the tail and it's about it. Moreover, many of the special effects stink, especially the giant papier mache hand that enters the room to grab the evil hubby.
