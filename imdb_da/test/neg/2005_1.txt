This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen! Me and my husband own over 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi and Horror B movies that are not top-notch but still entertaining.

It took us 3 attempts to get through the whole movie because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals. We thought it probably got better ... we were wrong. I'd rather see a body that gets embalmed than having to sit through it again !!! When it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like "Uh .. is that it?" The end seemed to be more, but they ran over their apparent budget of $ 500.00 and were like "Oh, shit ... we've broken ... but now ... fast ..
