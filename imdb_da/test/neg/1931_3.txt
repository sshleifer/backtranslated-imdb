The story is derived from "King Lear"; the setting is a yard in Iowa. Here's a try for this kind of thing: If you find yourself asking, "Why did it like that," and the answer is "because it happened in 'King Lear'," you know the movie has failed. Well, that's what happens here. The father's figure in this story does not live his own life, he mimics a fictitious. But there is more wrong with the film than this. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than I think she realizes. She tries to take the King Lear story and alters the setting altogether. This is a task in itself. The probable result is that the transplanted history will die, and no one will certainly be able to work out why (although there are probably successful transplants, such as "West Side Story", make it worth trying). But she also tries a revisionist story. In the version of "King Lear" she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril comment on our sympathy, and Cordelia is a villain. This is a task in itself. <br /> <br /> Success with every task is difficult; succeeding in both at once is impossible. In fact, it is impossible to succeed at some point as much as trying the other. If we are to look at the same events from a different moral perspective, then the events must be the same events - which means that attitude cannot be linked. If history is to be transplanted, alive, in a different setting, its moral heart must continue to beat constantly - meaning that no ethical perspective can be attached. Moorhouse was bound to fail in not only one but in both her efforts. And then she did it. ... It is of course possible to try both tasks, fail on both tasks, but with some fluke hit a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read Jane Smiley's novel, which for everything I know is good for independent reasons. But the movie is not. If there was nothing wrong with that, there would still be no question that it was just so thoroughly, scary DULL. The very grainy fields are even more boring than they would be in reality - which doesn't have to be the case when I can think of four movies ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest" from the top of my head ) "," The Straight Story "," Kikujiro "), where the cornfields are not boring at all.
