When I first saw it, I thought it was pretty scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the lazy teens are so annoying that you don't really worry about what is happening to them. There are some really good moments like Angela's talk about demons, and the short-sighted demon is effective. But it really does not stand for repeated viewing or close analysis. It's all quite tacky and cheap and often downright stupid, pornography and unfunny wisecracks too often replace horror. The music, however, is excellent and the epilogue is certainly entertaining, but this movie doesn't have much to recommend it, but comes just like another Jason-type stalk and slash ticket.
