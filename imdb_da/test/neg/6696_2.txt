A bad basketball movie. A gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small Indiana High School Basketball Team in the 1950s and coaches the boys to victory by "breaking them down first and then building them up." <br /> <br /> Not bad topic. Photography OK. But the plot is completely predictable. No real subplots. Nothing added to make the movie exciting. You know what has to happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4. graders.
