Cyclone is a piece of killer with little redeeming value, even on it so badly the entertaining front. One of my friends took the tape from a crowded St. Vincent DePaul clothing container. Okay, it can be a little risky, but it was supposed to be a clothes box, not a crappy old VHS bin, something the less fortunate members of our society don't really have to make their lives better. It could be considered a mercy. Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add to their problems. Nevertheless, the basic premise for a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle is that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers, not even properly used. The two "high speed" chase sequences involve vehicles running at less than about 40 KMPH ascending speeds, and a super-fast motorcycle at risk of being overtaken by a crazy old station wagon is not the awe inspiring when you come down to it. There is only one scene where the bikes are foggy weapons used in the film's climax, and it's ridiculously ineffective, or just ridiculous when it is. This includes laser beams that appear to come out of an evil troll's hands in a cheesy eighties of swords and witchcraft that produced large flame explosions that apparently have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. The rest of the film is just boring hard to see filler. Lots of bad actors, even Combs and Landau suck in this, most of which seem to have been lifted from the set of a porn movie, are about to exchange a really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to send out the tightly-coherent plot. There are a couple of badly staged fighting sequences and some tirelessly scary comic relief scenes with some police and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. Comedy by sub Benny Hill horny old man can not stop staring at the woman's lead chest black. Basically, the "money" scenes involve the bike that actually does things, get and paralyze, and the rest is lumpy filler. Skip it over.
