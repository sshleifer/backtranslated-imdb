I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the 80s as a successful young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for internet related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I can't remember seeing him in any movie since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low-cost movies a chance, but this one started lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this eerie woman chats with an Asian guy in a chat room. They basically stimulate their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant personally. She meets him, has sex, binds him and kills him in cold blood. The reason is then further aggravated. <br /> <br /> The reason is thin and flimsy and the actor is very stiff. Do not rent it much less when you buy it, even if it is in the $ 1 DVD tray. I'm planning to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am really amazed that any of the previous reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.
