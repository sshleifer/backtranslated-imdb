What could have been a good movie about the late poker pro (pre-poker craze) Stu "The Kid" Unger was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can tell the filmmakers who worked on a short budget. Everything looks filmed on the cheap. Timelines seemed a little to me. <br /> <br /> Casting Michael Imperoli from Sopranos was also a poor casting choice. He looked too old to play the baby-faced Stu, he looked too healthy for a cola addict (if you look at recordings from the 1997 WSOP main event, the real Stu was so skinny and he had almost no nose for much cocaine so he carried them sunglasses to hide them) and I waited for Adriana to come up and shout "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> They also ran out that he had a son of Angie's past affairs who committed suicide in the late 80s. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten forward, I continued thinking that he should announce "Show Songs in Stu's Head." as he does at the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for real Stuey recordings, check out the ESPN Classic because they are constantly reusing the 1997 WSOP Main Event. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad pace.
