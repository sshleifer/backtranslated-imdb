I am a great Eric Roberts fan, I am collecting his film and so far reaching 60. But I am honest to say that sometimes he makes really horrible movies. But hey that's why I like him - he's entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this must take the price, I can't stop why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and Corbin Bernsen to the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is horrible (I really don't like him), Roberts manages to be the best in the movie (and that doesn't matter much). He practices it routinely. <br /> <br /> The female lead (Brasselle) resembles a plastic doll and acts as one more. And Tim Abell and his crew look like action-man plastic dolls and work like them. <br /> <br /> The reason is really embarrassing. I haven't seen any of the Carnosaur movies, so I can't remember the pictures that have been added from there, but it does explain some things. But there are still gaps big as craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are located outside the lab in the nearby forest. But in the end, they blow the whole lab into pieces and relax that everything is over, but they forget them outside. When the helicopter pilot is eaten alive, I wonder how she could not feel a T-rex climb in the chopper ???? <br /> <br /> The boys in orange overalls are my favorite - what do they do for a jogging round or what? /> Of course, there is also a B-movie standard sex scene with silicon titties involved. This time, Lorissa McComas is greeting us. I have no problem with it (she looks terrible) but looking at a guy who squeezes tits and is on the brink of climax for 8 !!!! minutes are just tooo long. Shame on you all (including Eric Roberts) - Now I'm looking forward to seeing Con Games (I'm wondering ???)
