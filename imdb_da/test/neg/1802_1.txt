The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was in no way able to live up to the excellent book. The movie contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than helping them understand what was going on. The director was obviously not experienced, and if he is, he did not show it. Apart from that, scenes from the book were omitted or changed, scenes that were quite important. The movie left me feeling a little sad and completely wasted my time. The characters worked as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the feelings that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall, the movie was horrible and completely lacked the excitement that would otherwise be needed to make it even externally interesting.
