Most people get the luxury of writing in the title of a movie and finding out about the movie before they see it, but unfortunately I've never been one of those people. I wouldn't even read synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to it because if you ignore such warnings and even give a movie a chance after it has flopped in theaters, you enter at your own risk and may just end up with a bad taste in your mouth, which is exactly how I feel about this silly movie. Honestly, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap is some of the songs (and seriously excludes title tracks). Even the ever-promising Kangana Renaut's talent (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here as she plays Ruhi, the woman who has caught the attention of both leading male characters played by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ a rootless music producer ) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses AJ's path). Celina Jaitley gives the right amount of OOMPH required by a socialite infected by Reggi (who she helped get her foot in the record industry's door). This doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should contain Anupam Kher right? Now you are wrong because he is in the same way as Reggi's father (another wasted talent). <br /> <br /> The movie may not have been so bad if they had not passed the letter behind Deol's character. The moral message was too predictive (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the end was far too crowded that it would make you wonder why you sat down for such a foolish movie in the first place. It is true, this is a sign of shed.
