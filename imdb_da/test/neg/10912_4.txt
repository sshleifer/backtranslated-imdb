Cujo is a huge, gracious, gentle and loving St. Bernard, owned by the Camber family, during the opening sequence chokes Cujo a rabbit across the fields and through a local tree somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears in a burrow and Cujo holds the head into the entrance hole. The rabbit disappears from Cujo's sight, angry Cujo begins to bend and thereby inadvertently wakes up and irritates a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's true life mate), as her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, discovers. Of course, their relationship is tense. Fortunately, ignorant of all this is their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) solves cars to live off his barn at his farm. Joe is planning a weekend with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 at the lottery and decides to take their young boy Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) with her on a trip to see her parents. Arriving at Gary's house to pick him up Joe finds him dead on the floor, he enters the kitchen to call for help and his dog Cujo, who is now healthy attack and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to Camber's farmhouse to try to get her car repaired. The place is deserted, except Cujo, who is now completely rabid, frothy at the mouth, his fur spotted red with blood and maddened by pain. Cujo attacks the car to try to get to Donna and Tad, fortunately for them, the windows are stuck, at least for the time being. Donna tries to start the car, but it is completely degraded, they are both caught with nothing but the hope that someone will come and save them. Cujo is in waiting, ready to attack and kill anyone crossing his path. Directed by Lewis Teague I thought the movie was a little slow for my taste. The first half stretches, the other half builds up a steam shock, but I still felt it was a bit of awe-inspiring and unexciting. The action is fine by everyone involved, I have no complaints there. Technically, the film is ok, photography, music, special effects, editing and it is generally well made. The big problem is the script by Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier, and especially it is the first half, most of which seem to be padded to stretch the maturity. Looking into just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer. It is also a little predictable. Cujo as a monster has never really scared me either, I just don't find slobbering overweight St. Bernard's scary, I guess. I guess there's nothing really wrong with that, but I don't think I'd be busy watching it again. Average, not so bad, if you can find a copy that goes cheap or catches it on T.V. free of charge.
