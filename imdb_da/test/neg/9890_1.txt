This movie will take place in Milford NJ. I know the house it is based on as well as the person. As you can see at the end of the demovie, she was killed in the World Trade Center event. I know this because I was one of the police officers who helped identify his remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The necessity of the film went a bit far. I'm not a prude, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without actually showing it all. This movie is in bad taste and I can't see how her family would give it a blessing. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
