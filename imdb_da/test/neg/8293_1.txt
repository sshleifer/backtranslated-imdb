This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script as they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes it a comedy, but the movie cannot determine whether it will be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action movie. Press releases showed that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what did they think?). If you like William Shatner (I do), see "Free Enterprise" instead.
