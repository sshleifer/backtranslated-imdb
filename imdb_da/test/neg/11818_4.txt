The reason for the Black Mama White Mama is about two female inmates, at a woman's prison in the Philippines. A black and a white. These two women are thrown together in prison. Pam Grier's Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in the hell woman's prison for dancing like a harem girl. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits from his drug trafficking. Lee is primarily interested in breaking out of prison to get her beau's drug money so she can leave the Philippines and take a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged background who is also revolutionary. Karen has become a member of a group of revolutionaries who are determined to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She is trapped by Philippine authorities and held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story line starts when Karen and Lee break out of the prison they were together. The two were also linked at the wrist. When flying, they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue. Of course, they hate being linked. But they are also aware that they have to set their differences to help each other survive while they avoid catching. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it is because much of the cast in two movies is the same, as well as their location in the Philippines. Roger Corman, has always had a stable staff of actors he used in all of his 70's B-movies. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith were among the many players who were often thrown into Corman's AIP movie. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage, the Black Mama White Mama, trusts too much violence to be tasty. Pam Grier produces her usual hard chick persona in this movie and shows her competency as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov is less effective in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She just seems fragile and well coiffed to be a dedicated political guerilla. Apart from Sid Haig, like the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie has little entertainment value unless excessive violence is your thing. Only the performances by Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this movie worth seeing.
