I liked the movie, it's just that the characters run around without any real point on their craziness. As I said, poor goat. The goods were nahing while the guy pretending to paint on it. I would like to rape the scenes to be more graphic (not the one with goats, however). Jane Ryall, who played Celia, did only this movie. She was very naked all the way through. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who were also selected to be sinners. If you like crazy walls, it's your movie. 3.10
