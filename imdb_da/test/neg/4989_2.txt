Let me start by saying that I would never see this movie in the first place; I had to see it one day, and I figured I think I can light up and enjoy it for what it is and it can be entertaining. What I came up with was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, none carried. First of all, there was nothing humorous at least. Creators expect humor to be ridiculous / acceptable if they include sarcasm in each line that comes out of Underdog's mouth and uses scene after blind days, played out aspects to "charm" the public's heart-light side while still making them "ooh" and "ah" for more with boring action scenes and inappropriate, sharp performances that made me shout at everyone in the audience who enjoys it. The action was boring, humor was boring and the characters / plot felt as if they were spending about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities, giving the uninspiring actors / actresses no scope on how to portray their characters with the least depth. This film is plain and simply awful in all areas, and only children under 10 will be able to enjoy it, which, although it is what age range it was aimed at, does not apologize for being so daring and causing me to feel so deprived . Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best, recent family / kids flicks, or even Alvin and Chipmunks are better than this filth!
