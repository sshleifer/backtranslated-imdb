Dustin Hoffman's debut feature is not as bad as it is known to be; a Spanish / Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is uneven but generally derived and deals with an abundance of shady characters in search of $ 1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero who, despite being triple - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!). Of course, Hoffman's performance is not exactly as nuanced as in later films, but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what is basically similar to a gracious klutz - an ill-fated American tax consultant of Sicilian descent (called Puzzu, which nobody seems to be able to right!) sent out of his company to retrieve the money and told remains "unnoticed", but instead is forever in trouble - although he ultimately turns out surprisingly exciting to find the leaf, fold the bad guys and win the girl ( Martinelli as Romero's daughter who's a little wasted here) !! <br /> <br /> However, the movie's best moments are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his would be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of the dialect, he is flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance of his various arrangements! Also in the light of the history of Rome, it is strange that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (no doubt an existence of the co-production agreement)! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have missed Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - a number of times (I guess mainly because Leonard Maltin only speaks it * 1/2 in his "Movies & Video Guide "... but then MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); With Pietro Germi director and co-starring the delicious Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of that movie are certainly more respectable, and I really hope it will soon show up on Italian TV ...
