It's been ten years since this movie was released, and the time sands haven't improved it a bit again, just like the other comments made the Aussie film producers have a bit more drama than middle class aussies running around beautiful places on cycles with not much in the dialogue. the middle class is not fun or rich. There is also a mish mash of cast. why should a young woman marry a man who is old enough to be her father, it escapes me. It's such a shame about this movie, looks like a wonderful place to vacation you. Anyway its an hour and thirty minutes of my life I will never be able to come back. Live too short to watch this movie.
