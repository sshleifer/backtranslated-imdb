Stinger starts '3 months ago' on the submarine SS Newark, where genetic experiments have gone wrong, and the crew member is brutally slaughtered by large murderers ... Jump to 'Camp Pendleton' a few months later, when General Ashford (James Cagnard) is Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission aboard the Newark and assists the genetic researcher Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows), before anyone knows, is a group of business scientists and marines aboard the Newark and is shocked to discover he mutilated the crews of the crew except Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) who doesn't make much sense. It is not long before the Scorpions attack, first to fall, is Lt. Williams, so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) promotes and takes responsibility for getting everyone safe and ending the threat from the giant scorpions forever ... <br /> <br /> This collaboration production in Sweden was directed by Martin Munthe & he also handled the cinematography. I thought this was a strictly-speaking, uninspiring being. It's early in the New Year & Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster / creature / insect type movie I've seen in 2007, hopefully things can only get better ... The script of Mat Nastos is incredibly clich√©d and gets everything ideas from other films, especially foreigners (1986), let us see that the isolated location in this case is a submarine, which is the rapidly assembled team of marines, including one chewing on a cigar throughout the film that is the scientists , including a blonde Swedish one to try and explain the whole thing and the evil money that tackles the company's villain who puts the mighty dollar over human life and the final ingredient is monster / alien / insect or whatever, in this case There are lots of great scorpions running around, but they are not exploited in any kind of unique or imaginative way, so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. Yes, that's all here, unfortunately, Stinger is not foreigners if you get what I mean. It is a touch far in excess of 100 minutes, and it is very predictable, although it moves together at a reasonable pace and as a stupid creation feature you can do worse despite what many people say on IMDb ... Director Munthe distinguishes Not by itself, it is not scary that lacks atmosphere and the action scenes are boring and unexciting. There are not many scorpion attacks, and it is almost an hour before any significant action takes place. The special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen worse, that's for sure. This does not mean that the effects in Stinger are good, but I have seen worse. There is not much blood or gore, there are some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads and some are torn in half. The only wise and fun moment in the whole movie is when the naked Swedish female researcher asks her boyfriend to turn her on to talk about all the money they are going to make from the scorpions ... But there was a moment there made me moan & tear my hair out in it's stupidity as a block tries to repair the submarine circuit and make the lights work by pushing the power supply / computer tables with a hammer and it also works ... <br /> <br /> Technical Stinger is at best average & there is the usual endless amount of dark corridors that become monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if your interested. The action was bad and there is nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a good movie, nor is it a big scary movie, nor can I recommend it, but I've seen worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely) you might like the same theme 'giant scorpions on the loose' movie Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (as unlikely).
