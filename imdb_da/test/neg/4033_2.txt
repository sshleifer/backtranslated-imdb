Seeing this movie really surprised me. I never found myself stopping to watch a movie in its entirety, because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good sum of money and darn it, I should at least see it all and get my money's worth. I made it through about 30 minutes of this crazy movie when I thought of myself, now I'm a little more stupid after watching this movie. I can't believe the director and the actors in this movie actually had so little respect for themselves to allow it to be released! <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can say, it has not been said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst movies there is usually one or two decent performances ... not in this piece of pathetic waste . I have seen better plays in high school. Every one and I think every actor is out of faith and what is truly amazing is the uniformity of loneliness ... gh, it must have been the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> This may be one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although it is entertaining in places because of its ridiculous scripts and even weaker action, and I use this phrase very loosely, it is unfortunate that this movie was not sent to B movie hell forever. What could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget, poor sound and effects and actors who have probably earned their wings in the children's television and bad children's television on it. <br /> <br /> Please note this movie. Not even worth a minute of your time.
