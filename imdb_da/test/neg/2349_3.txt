Whatever anyone says, it's a B movie, and the effects are poorly done. If you are a vampire fanatic, I suppose it would be ok, not 10 out of 10, you others here can't rightly say it. we must see it as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important as well as the story. The story is good, but it doesn't carry the movie, no wonder it has a low rating all over. I am writing this because I chose to watch this movie when I saw some good reviews on IMDb but was seriously disappointed. Don't make me wrong, I thought the sheet music was amazing and loved the underworld movie, but those characters aren't dense. makeup on the vampires is poorly finished and the effects are worse. this sucks. I might not have been so disappointed if I hadn't read the reviews here that told me how great it was. The reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think it's great, you don't care to act or make up. this is better as a book 3 out of 10 for an OK story ..
