I was sitting here on television in the hope of the names in it that it would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie, who thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent, but the performance is terribly bad, with a constant illogical sequence of scenes, an end that is almost ridiculously melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look at his weak face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40s ...
