I have to say it's not very good. Polly Bergen is fine in this movie. The rest is so. I'm gay and honest, there are so many cliches this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching it and turned it off and decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But everyone said the basic idea of ​​the movie is good. If it was rewritten with less constructed lines and better functioning it could actually have been prety good. Over all I would not recommend it. In addition to this, coo coo thinking line is so lame. In addition, the fight in the hairdressing salon is fun because it is so bad. The lesbian sister in the room with them while trying to get it on is so weird, it's boring.
