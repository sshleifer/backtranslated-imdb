Vindicator opens with a memorable scene of a monkey in a cage that attacks a ripping from a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This incident of violence sold it to me, and I am happy to say the rest of Vindicator provided a genuine cheese party. The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who nearly killed an explosion in his laboratory, if tattered remains, put into an experimental body suit / armor. For some unavoidable reason, he is equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device attached to his brain that will kill him if he comes into physical contact with any other person. They provide some clear explanations about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism, but I can't see the logic of installing such a device unless you wanted a violent cyborg killer. It is particularly ridiculous when it is stated that the suit Carl is wearing is actually an experimental suit. What are the possible needs for an astronaut to become the incredible caveman while on mission? He predictably breaks out of the lab and continues to fight the risky scientists who put him in the suit along with the ninja assassin Hunter played by Pam Grier (no, really). The Vindicator looks pretty amazing to goofy. It's basically a guy in a missing golden foil suit. He also has a perpetually confused look in his eyes that does not inspire fear or compassion. I think you can't blame him for what most people who see the movie will have the same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The play is of the really bad, stolen, "I'm not sure what the character's feelings or thoughts are, this point, so I take a point and crack my dialogue in a random tone while I Trying not to look at the camera school The actor who plays the funky black scientist is even struggling with this last part. <br /> <br /> It is after this first unfortunate death that the vindicator goes after the scientists. that the whole Rage Response Activator 'touches me and I kill you' does not play a big role as you might expect with Carl to go after his former colleges in a relatively detached way. There was a scene where he rather brutally kills some street punches pushing him around, I know it is the rigueur for street bands to randomly attack the protagonists of the 1980s, but surely one of them must have realized that it might be a bad idea to attack it cyber girl, although he is similar is C3PO's retarded cousin, as they are not even surprised to see a missing golden cyborg walking down the street as if it were a daily event for them. The only other time this racial response activator comes up in the movie is when old Carl can't give his wife a hug. When Hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him, he is forced to kill her, he randomly notes that he has reprogrammed himself (Off-screen naturally) so it does not. They could have omitted the entire Rage Response Activator thing and just gone with a pretty revenge story and it wouldn't have made a big difference to the movie. There is a fun sequence in the sewers like Grier and her companions track down the Vindicator. Because of his armored hide, they are all armed with weapons burning "evaporated acid." For some bizarre reasons when these weapons are fire, it is represented on the screen by cartoon-like red lines that strike against their target ala Ghostbusters. The winemaker fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and burning all of Grier's goons into a huge flame blowing out. The resulting fireball is so large and powerful that it comes out of the sewer out of a manhole and blows the habit of a few scientists. Strangely enough, Grier escapes by throwing herself into the empty deep water despite being closest to the Vindicator. This is one of several fake burning explosions throughout the movie, including the death of a funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his van to a rock. (This is after they caught The Vindicator by catching him in a huge lump of gello-no, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing and long and indefinite sequence in which Carl's treacherous obese friend, resembling a poor man's Ned Beatty, reveals his dismay with Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It continues for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots from the guy who smashes over his wife's face, rubbing her on top of her and trying to pull off her dress. It is icky to say the least and really seems to be abrupt with most of the rest of the film, which is a bit comic and bigger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The movie finale involves Vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in combat suits. Whatever the reason, all these other dudes are less kick-ass than Carl, some of them being sent by wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side skinned out. Fortunately for Carl the suit he wears, this defective design flaw is missing. The only really memorable part towards the end is Grier's death. Doing something I've never seen a stupid in a movie before in the middle of her confrontation with the Vindicator, she decides that she really doesn't stand a chance against him, and in a way that really blows her own brains out with her pistol
