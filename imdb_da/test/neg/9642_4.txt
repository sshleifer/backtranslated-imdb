Handled, heavily handed, full of speeches, sermons, on the nose and over stylized in a way that only MTV could be guilty of, Stop-Loss is agit-prop garbage. I had expected much more with talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but Screenwriter / Director Kimberly Peirce does a hatchet job depicting the detrimental effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work to investigate the Iraq war and the young men are struggling in it, but you'll never guess it from seeing Stop-Loss. In many ways, this clutter reminded of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, an equally unfortunate, overly stylized, television movie-like waste of solid subject matter. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
