Synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman who challenges society's conventions. I like strong female characters and expected a movie much like "Chocolat" with a small adventure and more bites. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-driven movie to be effective, I must feel a connection or compassion for the people. There was no one I could relate to in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") depicts a mentally ill, probably bipolar, woman who is often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and shouts when he doesn't hit or relax anyone. The kids are rude brats. They shout at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence commits violence This seems to be an island with unpleasant, aggressive, violent and rude people all around. The direction is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art but instead drill the viewer. The location is exceptionally beautiful, but even it is not caught to the extent that it could be on film. I must recommend to stay away from this mistake in a movie.
