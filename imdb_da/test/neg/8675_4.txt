Oh God! The BBC is not being knocked out of its pedestal to absorb time dramas from it. I agree with this novel Jane Austens is hard to portray specifically to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly an Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to make female hearts skip a blow. But I have to say I was hoping for an improvement in the end and unfortunately was disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was changed so that everything that was Jane Austen's tone, way, feeling, depth, was diluted if it was not lost. If some past adaptations can be seen as dated, this weakness must be that it is too modern ('his life is a long party' ?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was wrong choice , it needed some more restraint, i got no impression of hidden depths under a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see that I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
