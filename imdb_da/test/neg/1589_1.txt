Thomas Vinterberg's "The Greatest Heroes" is another road movie without the most important element of a movie: a good story. The characters are not very original and not very interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, plays the same role he has played in the last couple of years, and which he repeated in the "Festen" - it seems that he seems to work = being angry and screaming at other people! The movie does not make much sense and is not much fun either - even though it tries hard to be "boiling" and "strange". If you are going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?
