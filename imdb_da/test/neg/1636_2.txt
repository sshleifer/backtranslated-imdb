There are lots of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made. There are certainly many mistakes: lack of action, a little boring and clich√© and sometimes paradoxical script and make B-movie sound and "special" effects. As mentioned, there are lots of glosses of plot, making _Cave Dwellers_ a fantasy film, especially in comparison to the Rings ring trilogy. But this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most, if not all (including this review) of these reviews are written by fans of MSTK3. Therefore, many of these reviews are quite numerous summaries of the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers_. In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow tell the food scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it. I have found this movie endearing-not in a way to find _Forrest Gump_ endearing-but in the effort put in this movie of some cast. Also this movie is ridiculous without its MSTK3 treatment. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take seriously, and it does not attempt to import into its viewers some sort of fair theme. For all the monster puppets, medieval sliding glide and continuity lapses - this movie no longer announces what it is, a low depiction of a rather low genre. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I can't bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hat is for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. etc. <br /> <br />
