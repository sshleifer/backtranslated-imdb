This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B movie. The manuscript is horrible, it just winds around the constant ridicule of crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on the face and does not do justice either. <br /> <br /> First, there are 30 minutes of pretty unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam war prisoners? the guy playing basketball at some point ... how more can you pander to your audience? ... the prison time is dull, convincing and can already easily put one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Back in the US, the guy is not considered at all for any real reason as a "war hero". Yet, of course, he is quickly forgotten by the public and seems to stumble upon all kinds of unfortunate accidents. Or are they really? We will soon find out. Yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: his sick mother, his little daughter, he never meets, a high endhore who falls in love with the hero, etc. It is very strange how this movie constantly changes from tragedy to slapstick in an instant. Does not work at all. <br /> All in all, it's really just a bad comedy and a poor service to prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian, played in a few good movies and died of MS, is no reason not to be annoyed by this stupid, unconvincing, unfunny comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be thrilled with reading 3 hours of Dadaist poetry.
