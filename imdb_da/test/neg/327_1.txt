When you see low budget horror movies as much as I do, you come to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie, as each movie maker adds its own flavor to the cheese. This is the case with Jack-O. When I looked at this really horrible movie, I was left with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, perhaps not as an instructor, but in any way, and as I examined, I found that I was correct. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something so pathetic, and this movie just reeked of Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why anyone would) avoid this movie. If you are going to rent an Olen Ray image, rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, it's the only bright shining star in Olen Ray's dark cheese universe of horrible movies.
