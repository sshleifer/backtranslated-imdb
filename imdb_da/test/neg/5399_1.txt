Should this be a comedy? The black cape and skeleton mask are fun. There is like zero plot. The movie starts with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a little mention of their digging site being cursed. And then look and see ...... in drops Halloween Costume Man, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face with an ax. Then he kills these two people. Then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of Predator, only the commanders are being chased by Halloween Costume Man, who is now running on a horse! Several commands appear, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hike group. Yes, the production certainly went out of command costumes. Can you say low budget? Anyway, they come on a lonely old Indian guy sitting in the woods. He's just for fun. And he starts to babble about something, but you really don't know what he's mumbling about, so the flashback to some Indians is killed. None of it really makes sense. And then we go back to our commands, where several of them are killed. And that's basically the plot. It's so ridiculously bad, you just can't look away because you'll see how low it is. You could make the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and a bunch of friends with fake weapons. Don't watch this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or just skip it and get something like the right Predator.
