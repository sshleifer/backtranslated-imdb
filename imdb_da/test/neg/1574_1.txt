This attempt at a "thriller" would have no substance at all! Some may say that this movie "has it all?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, carved neck, murder, blood, a snub nosed revolver, knee teeth groan, breasts (various definitions can be used), big flashlights, tribal people, a brother duo trying to out-portray "stupid and stupid" white wolves, fighting scenes reminiscent of "happy slapping," snow mobile (s), a big track vehicle and a motel under renovation? All this, with an "Enyanesque" melody towards the end ... Maybe my rating is a bit tough, but a view will certainly be enough for the sane cinemaphile with nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
