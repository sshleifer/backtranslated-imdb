Film starts well in 1872 with a fierce, bloody battle between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves into dust - van Helsing also dies. Someone collects Dracula's ashes and bury them because of a church. Cut to 1972 - here is where the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> We are immediately hit by the head with loud, bad 70's music, HORRIBLE fashion and stupid dialogue. When this was done, Hammer lost money and decided to try something to get a hit. Placing Dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea. Fashion, music and dialogue kill the movie terribly. We are introduced to a bunch of annoying children in their 20s who decide to have a black mass - "for a giggle". Of course, they have it in the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive Dracula. It's a good thing, a descendant of van Helsing is around ... but Dracula goes after his niece (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are good as always in their roles, and when on the screen, the movie gets a much needed shot of energy. The opening and end of the games are the highlights of the movie (though the end is spoiled by playing miserable 70's music). Also the child's main leader is Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) - a really stupid name dating back to the 1940s. The film also has a scream queen Caroline Munro looks amazing. The film is well-designed and quite effective, but the plot is stupid, the constant blocking of the 70s fashion, dialogue and music becomes annoyingly really fast, and I was basically sorry. <br /> <br /> Most Hammer fans agree - this was one of the worst Dracula movies - that is the follow-up (Satantic Rites of Dracula) was the worst - and the last Hammer Dracula movie. This gets a 2 - only for Cushing and Lee.
