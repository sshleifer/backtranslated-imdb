I went into the movie and expects a little action mixed with a strong storyline. I understand that changes between written works and movies must be made ... for many reasons. The change of the relationship between the researchers (they were the father - daughter in the book) CERN's director was eliminated so that the scene between Carmelengo and the director changed to Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss guard in the Pope's office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard took care of getting his father inserted as a cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and Carmelengo climbed into the sky in the helicopter with Hank's character landing in the river and the priest landed on the chapel of what was described as a Christian image. <br /> <br /> At one point, this movie was to be restored by a director up to the job
