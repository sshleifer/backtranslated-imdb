From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed that they released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received in any way. Not sure where to go next, when they thought Anderson was the best director of the franchise, and they had produced a genuine sci-fi gem, Fox turned to the small but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answer. These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and the House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Your first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen actors shortly after. <br /> <br /> Now the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie itself. Leaving important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of big new lines for the general audience to remember years down the queue - it was harder. They bumped their heads for a while and came up with a truly award-winning manuscript with clich√© characters, idiotic decisions, a yawning plot. <br /> <br /> Fox was happy with the results, but wanted to see what would become of centerpieces for the movie - aliens and predators. The monkeys once again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to take on the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with Alien-man-in-the-suit seen in the old movies. The actors who played foreigners were having trouble fitting into the suits as they were not properly sized by the monkeys, so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided that a predator was probably this time (again saving budget) to fight hordes of foreigners who apparently come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects you ask? Come on, people now. They may be monkeys, but they knew clearly that CGI would play a key role in the movie. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and paste some very nice fire and sparking effects all the way through. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens gave some good Predator visions. The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this were to be on Earth, in Colorado for all places, they needed to make it realistic. It was here that they admitted that they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys did not have proper training in this department, so they thought to turn off the lights in the city and make the movie play out in the night's death and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like seeing the creatures instead of looking at shadows and counting the whole movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally recorded all the battle scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie errors. <br /> <br /> The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually occurred, the monkeys made a habit of displaying the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got what they wanted, and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of plays that involved that violence. <br /> <br /> Originally, some of the actors had questions about the manuscript. Why does a blue liquid Predator have endless amounts of magic resolution, no matter what he wants and no more than that? Why is an ex-judge driving a police car all over the movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body of foreigners? Why does a watch play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions continued to grow, but the monkeys ignored them and completed their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was thrilled with their work. So excited that they opened the film nationwide on Christmas Eve and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these beloved franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask what has ever happened to the budget, the monkeys have forgotten to use? They set it against their next movie: Aliens vs Predator vs Hulk Hogan. They knew the public would be saddened by the title, but they have since released this statement: <br /> <br /> "To the people - do not worry about our upcoming movie. It will be judged R and will have violence." br /> And everybody lived happily ever after. The end.
