Found this movie in a DVD voucher for $ 10. It wasn't worth it. Some of the camera's work and dialogue look and sound like it was done by a film student. Sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was mocked and dragged. <br /> <br /> One thing I want to give them, though. Unlike most action films, people in this movie actually ran out of ammunition and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
