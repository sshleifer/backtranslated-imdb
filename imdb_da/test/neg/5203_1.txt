As a big fan of the original Operation Delta Force, I thought I would pick this movie up. I figured it couldn't be that bad. But here's a list of things I learned to see Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of US armed forces, is mostly mildly overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s. - The Delta Force, despite being the elite of US armed forces, bears standard police pistols or AK-47s on their main missions. <br /> <br /> - Despite being the elite of the US armed forces, Delta Force has not learned that during stealth missions, wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces, it will not you out of sight. <br /> <br /> - When you throw a Molotov cocktail in a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When you hit a tank fire, you can run away, even if the smoke that is caused can cause less breathing. You can die from a standard gun shot, but you can also live in spite of being hit several times by a sniper rifle and one by an AK-47. <br /> <br /> - In hand-to-hand combat, members of the Delta Force, despite being the elite of the US armed forces, are regularly haunted by railway guards. <br /> <br /> - If bad guys approach you on a slow train, there's nothing to worry about - between the 4, they can't figure out how to get an automatic weapon to shoot, let alone hit someone from 5 meters with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you're less on actors, just reuse them - the bad guy from Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy called Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the guy who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 is now playing Skip Lang, another good guy. It's not OK for Delta Force to shoot an unarmed terrorist, even if he's trying to reload his weapon to kill you. Grenades explode with the ground when thrown by members of the Delta Force. When thrown by non-Delta Force personnel, they explode exactly the point where Delta Force members have thrown the grenades back to the evil ones. <br /> <br /> - The tanks can run faster than standard cars. <Br /> <br /> - Military and personal armies use the exact same helicopter that UN used in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy in that helicopter cannot see you if you lie face down. <br /> <br /> - Shooting someone several times in the chest will cause less damage. Stabbing the person in the knee will kill them within 5 seconds. - Delta Force steals cars from old people to come around when they are in foreign countries because the US military does not give them any kind of transport. This can also explain why they caught public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not really the best moment in film making, but it's good to laugh.
