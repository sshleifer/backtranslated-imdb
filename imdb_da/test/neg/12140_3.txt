<br /> <br /> Well, good costumes and a wonderful "feel" to Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Big actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... If you can't get memorable performances out of this "A List," then the problem is this movie must be due to pitiful direction and an insufficient script. I rented this on DVD after wishing "Angels & Insects" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can hardly believe how boring this thing was. It just turned on and off, and no one was able to save the poor thing. This is not even a good exciting-foreign dudes-and-young-things-in-clothing-chicken flick! <br /> <br /> "Tea With Mussolini" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
