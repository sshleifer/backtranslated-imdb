Being a prolonged fan of Japanese movies, I expected more than this. I really can't be bothered to write too much, as this movie is just as bad. The story can be the sweetest romantic little something ever, pity, I couldn't hold that horrible spectacle, the messy pacing called and the standard "quirky" Japanese story. If you've noticed how many Japanese movies are used characters, plots, and phrases that seem to be "different," then you have to remove that movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could have told you how this movie should move, and that's not a good thing in my book. Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: his role in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you are a violent fan, you do not have to suffer from this waste of movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
