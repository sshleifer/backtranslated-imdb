Overambitious and shoddy; and sometimes too dark illuminated. DARK REALITY scenario is not even close to being original. Dark and dank basement. Kidnapped prisoners. Terrible survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends that she wants backpackers across Europe. She doesn't make it out of town. She is gripped by a rain, pavement and awakening in a dungeon. She eventually realizes that she is not alone, and when she meets a couple of her fellow prisoners, there are different thoughts about survival. Her cellmates begin to die of one after another. Can she get enough strength and courage to see daylight again? Others in the cast: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
