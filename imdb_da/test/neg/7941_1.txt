The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty and - perhaps most importantly - short. This remake is relentlessly padded and talky. Even worse, the African American hero in the first movie has been replaced by the beautiful white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "Assault" less progressive than the 1970s. God how I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely plot line and his weird sense of humor. I even miss his B-list actors who are leagues better than Hawke and company. <br /> <br /> I can't say I care about the new villains in this version - they stretch the little credibility the story has ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his chain performances. The music is also wrong - it's boring action stuff that actually detracts from the excitement. Simply horrible.
