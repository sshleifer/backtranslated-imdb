This movie took up three hours, including advertising, on the History International Channel last night. But it felt like three weeks. It was not the cheap, stagy and unintentional fun portrayals of the bombing of Dresden. It was not that the film was removed by almost every connection around World War II. It wasn't even that the bombing itself was made to seem like nothing but a big trouble for a great love story. No, they were the wooden-fate characterizations that sucked their lives out of history. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible for a movie to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would be the DRESDEN - as URIAH HEEP WOULD have experienced it. <br /> <br /> It is especially the last point that then annoys. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The actors in this movie believe it. But in the typically emasculated way the Germans have come to approach the Second World War, they cannot bring themselves to say it without asking for "peace" and "no more wars - anywhere" as if they were Mother Teresa . And it is also typical of German obsequiousness to the British that there is a cumbersome effort to gross before "Britishness" while transmitting all "guilt" to Dresden to a person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I tell a person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the film there is an exclamation mark from the leading person, Anna, with whom we all should sympathize with. "Damned Americans!" She screams as you look so far away from bombs falling. And a few minutes later, a radio voice is also warning of "American Terror Bombing" imposed on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Note the word "terror". Understood? It's really the Americans behind the inhuman targeting of German civilians. Regardless of whether the US strategy for almost the entire war in Europe was "precision" the bombing of industrial and war-making sites. No matter that it was the British who enthusiastically adopted "territory" bombing of civilian targets in Germany - before the Germans themselves had targeted English. No matter the Americans bombed during the day, suffering more losses in the process than the British to hit precision targets, while the British bombed civilians during the night's cover. No matter, the Americans were essentially brought into the RAF's Counter-Terrorism campaign, which kicked and screamed against it. Regardless, most US officials, from FDR to Director General Dolittle, opposed targeted civilians, while Churchill and his generals couldn't wait for it. <br /> <br /> No, in the DRESDEN, both the Germans and the British, except the "bombers" Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, it is assumed created by the evil Americans. And only the power and power of a love story between a German nurse and a worn British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of cruelty. Right. Oh, by the way, for the younger and probably less read readers of IMDb, the first and still only great literary effort to give a thought-provoking voice to Dresden's bombing, the pacifist novel written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American POW in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I think Germany's ZDF couldn't find a beautiful nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
