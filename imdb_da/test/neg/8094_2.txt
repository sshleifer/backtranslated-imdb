What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man breaking a garden hose? The action, especially the leading man Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so constructed and scary, it makes you hug. In fact, the guiding idea is not a bad thing for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but somehow the director manages to do the least. I rate it a 2 out of 10.
