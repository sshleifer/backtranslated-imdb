Conquerer Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an anime do not understand what their fans want. As a fan, I wouldn't have a 1920's evil Nazi movie. What I wanted to see is a really final showdown between Ed and Dante, as we don't really know what was going on. I would also have liked to get Ed back to his world much faster and make him stay there for finally getting a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a particular blond mechanic, that kind of thing. No, instead I got a coinciding plot involving Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes Al, a joke of a Cameo of Roy Mustang and only an Armstrong joke, a short joke and no Winry striking Ed with a wrench. Above all, it did not feel like a Fullmetal Alchemist to me.
