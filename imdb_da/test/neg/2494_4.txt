It is easier to see this movie if you see it as a scenario created by Star Flute Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his Holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a superficial, two-dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also miscast as General Leslie Groves, but the movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The actual mistakes and great freedoms taken (with the chronology of events) for the gambling author Bruce Robinson's political agenda make this movie embarrassing to see. This is probably why this film has found a home on the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combines poor science, bad history, poor screenwriting and mediocre action to produce a movie that should not be seen by impressionable high school or college students who don't know anything about Manhattan Project.
