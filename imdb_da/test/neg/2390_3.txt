Although it was not a complete waste of time, 'Eighteen' was really not as sweet as it pretended to be. Also, the actors' ages are they portray ?? 18, my ass. McKellen could actually have appeared in the film telling us he was 30 and asking us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible as a teen in 'Back to the Future' Part II and III (okay, maybe not, they are probably just credibility.) If you can get past the obvious age error, you either have the complete lack of action or simply assault (Paul Anthony's so-called anxiety, Clarence Sponagon's life moments, and although I do so in favor of Brendan Fletcher, it is best to just see him and more in 'Freddy Vs. Jason') incomprehensible scenes (a faster than Britney Spears marriage, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate but still has a hand free ?? i guess this was the author's imagination) a whole movie of despicable characters (Anthony can play anyone who is 18, but seems like he is 12 and some odd "john" thrown in so Anthony's character Pip can save the day? was there really a sex scene in front of a baby?) and virtually every character questioned their own sexuality by strange he scenes / scenes. On the positive side, I was delighted by Ian McKellen's voice-over as he saw a (rarely well-depicted) straight / gay friendship, puppy poop (from someone who gathers full puppies, that is, good score, a decent gay and dialogue dialogue). pedophilia would want more people to realize it and act from the female leader (as well as cumming.) I really can't recommend it as it really tries to be too many things ?? gay tolerance, homosexual hustling, homelessness, World War II, priesthood, first love, bad judges, etc. etc. on a shoestring budget.
