Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. The character of the class war would always be a topic worth throwing fun on, but this TV series is making better use of it than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying, and the authors wrote completely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, is it the best British sitcom in the mid to late 1970s that surpasses the kind of RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEXT, DO YOU GET SERVICE? etc. With the ON BUSES series completed a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now known) and enjoys a four-year race on the channel. <br /> <br /> However, the film is absolutely horrible in almost every respect. The overall essence of the TV series is almost entirely eliminated by the authors of this eerie movie (which anyone will immediately notice is not the same that worked on the series). As a commentator has already pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the television series and does not come across as almost as indulgent. <br /> <br /> The reason, instead of focusing on class war with Fourmiles it was the very basis of the TV series, actually writes Fourmiles almost completely after the first half hour. The reason, if you can call it, consists of George and Mildred on vacation to a hotel and being mixed with gangsters. First-class talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are well past their thriving time, and everyone looks very embarrassing as though they know very well that the only thing worth hanging around is a paycheck (which probably won't be much). <br /> <br /> The wit and gag in the movie (if you can call it that) is heavily dependent on the traditional British farce, including fake identities, embarrassing situations, badly-timed slapsticks, signs that lose control of what happens to them and general confusion. And it fails it all. As another commentator has pointed out, the authors of this movie seem to have never seen an episode of the television series and instead designed something similar to a CARRY ON body. The scene where George is stripped of Sue Bond's character is especially out of context. A mystery about this movie is the BBFC certification offered - 15. Just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the era of sitcom spin-off ceased not long after this film was released (shortly after Yootha Joyce's sad death). And the company behind this movie, Hammer, known for producing first-class horror films back in the 1950s to the mid-1970s, soon disappeared in total ambiguity. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film is an almost total leaching. My advice - skip this and stick to the TV series. You will not miss anything I assure you.
