Important plot-free action movies have two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) pitted against two evil ones (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action management in the 80s, Roundtree's small part is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his ridiculous turn in the "Toolbox Murders" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to carry flowers in his hair and complain about people bleeding on his blanket). Only Stack Pierce works with some dignity. As for the violence, don't worry: most things are too poorly done to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
