Or that's what the filmmakers want you to believe, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying so hard to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything from the film's appearance, cinematography, editing, dialogue and acting are arranged in super-chilled fashion from the go. Just to make sure no one misses how cool this movie is, there is a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western-surf-tex mex guitar plays constantly throughout the movie. As a final reminder of how naughty cool this movie is, all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice, for as we all know, it's bad. The plot (if actually one) seems pretty straightforward. But as someone else has already pointed out, the film's director and star seem firmly determined not to tell the story, but focus on an abundance of naked babies and dialogue that should be bad, but get tired surprisingly fast (they had a competition to see how many times they could get the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and its derivatives in an 80 minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible.
