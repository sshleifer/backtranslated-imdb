Strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong contexts, situations are just not fun with the cheesy voices and poor low brow comedy timing, the clear attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious, and it fails to deliver on all items of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high cringe factor and low laughter, I was shocked. This show went past the first season. Personally, I like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what your thinking, these shows are not weird at all, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snus Box, which are original with dry / black / dark humor / satire and are all at least 5/10. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is especially inexpensive, exaggerated and weird, but the context is well thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too.
