I liked this step when I was a kid, but now that I am older I can see how absurd the real thing is. If you did not read the previous reviews, it is about a teenager and a colonel of the air force stealing two fully loaded F-16s to save that teenager's father. <br /> <br /> It has some fine air streams, even if the dialog that accompanies them is pretty much a sign. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional humor in edited for TV version. When the hero's father is held by Iran, I'm not a named country, and his prisoners ask him for a decree (why he is being held, don't worry about exactly why or what they want him to confuse.) He says : "Tell him he can take my confession and push it down his throat." But his lips and more obviously make his movement clear which movement and part of the anatomy he really thought of.
