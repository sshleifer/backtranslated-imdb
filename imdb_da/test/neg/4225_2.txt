I think the cards were stacked against the webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling as if something was wrong, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Baptized. For a while, most of the lines succeeded either as voice over or off-screen, with just a little hint here and there until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of duplication that grinds on the nerves, with nothing even extremely fun about it. I hate doubling, but at least misplaced is martial arts that is badly doubled, tends to have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker actually doing hacking and stuff like that. Perhaps as a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (is about the person trying to keep them out instead of people trying to get in). What I got was some badly written, obscene sometimes murder mystery with a lot of bad chase sequences, a seemingly unlucky hacker that was neutralized without his little ego and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to get in there, take the camera from the guy and shoot dang things myself. The editing wasn't much better. The play? Well, if the principal didn't have such a bad script to work from, he would at least be able to see. The main bad guy was also ok, but just about everyone else was a joke. Dubbing didn't help, but the play was pretty bad, even taking it into account. <br /> <br /> Before I go into the worse, let's maintain a few good things. Well, one or two. In spite of the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoy the cyberworld spreads, how little of it was, and would have seen a movie most about, in and around it, than the insidious environment outside in the 'real world'. The fake thumb stuff seemed a little cool, but ended up being quite useless in the scheme of things. The heart of the Gadget, reminding me of Guillermo Del Toros Cronos, was interesting, but as a plot unit torn straight from the pages of Escape from New York, it was terribly conceived in the long run. There is a point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why didn't he try out the evil guy's thumb print then (when the heart device was thumb activated)? Nevertheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber things if they could only have been utilized better. <br /> <br /> Now who's here comparing this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future, and there is a kind of off-type type of romance in that kind of, in both films. There is the investigation of a murder, but I have seen many a movie with a murder in the center, which is not something like either Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. It's about where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison, as there would be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a good sense of art orientation and knows some basic elements of film making, such as where to put the camera. The webmaster is cheap and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character that hardly seemed to be in the first place to save the girl eventually to get her to point B without itself, so that he could do his thing very comfortably, or the attempt at the sympathy factor for a character, we have no need to take care of. Or confusing things like the car set up to stop them just enough for someone to get away.) . <br /> <br /> It is trying to be hip, it is trying to be explosive, it even tries a twist ending that is not surprising, and it is trying to be exciting. But a bunch of almost identical hunting sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. Don't make an exciting movie.
