I looked at the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile shot on. Although it's not as bad as Wynorski's "Curse of the Komodo", this still sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in "Curse of the Komodo", as well as the same actors and houses. The effects are top notch (surprising) but it's about it ........ I don't know what's more to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! As in "Prohibition of Komodo", the government becomes involved and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). Overall, this movie is absolutely scary even on poor movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had anything to do with a movie .... steer clear .... to avoid falling asleep, keep repeating "It's almost over. It's almost past ...". 0 out of 5.
