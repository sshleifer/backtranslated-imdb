I remember when this show came out. It was originally announced as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, it said "To be continued" to the dismay of all the people who had seen it all boring beyond the words of the word. It ended as it should, so yes, you can blame the series for having no end. The plan was that there was another course whose ratings had been higher, but it was a dull show so far and annoyed people by not quitting when it said it would, so they never did again. A lot of the comments are due to its cancellation and lack of viewing staff when the truth is that for this show it is not, it ended as it was actually scheduled to end, it's just a miserable end.
