I mainly watched Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. The plot has many a twist and turn - it is not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train. <Br /> <br /> But why throw a circus train wreck and a escaped gorilla? I can mention this without being a "spoiler" because circus train wreck and gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot. The bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve, but the circus took the wreck was purely by chance. It allows for a single scene with a threatening gorilla, but then it's back to the mystery of the murder!
