I can't explain what a lot of garbage this movie is. Just as I really can't. It's just so bad. <br /> <br /> plot = crap acting = crap budget = so low it is ridiculous <br /> <br /> Jesus, the only good thing in this movie is that the protagonist was pretty hot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel is that this movie is good, those who participated in the movie. I'm sure they aren't the ones who funded it because no money was put into it. (HAHAhaha to the bit where the heads are shaved) <br /> <br /> This movie is already wasted too much of my life so I will no longer waste time writing my review for it.
