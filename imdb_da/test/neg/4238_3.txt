Maybe this movie was special today. But five decades later it seems quaint, just another cinematic relic of the terrible 1950s. Stereotypes abound in this fluffy story of three female gold diggers who shop in a penthouse in Manhattan, to attract wealthy husbands. I don't mind the low theme. But the film's premise is lame. And the performance is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I found little to laugh at. The point of point about an extremely near-sighted bimbo is about the only wise element in history. Total dialogue is flat and then the delivery is also. And the script structure is disturbing. The reason continues to jump back and forth among the three ladies. It is as if the author could not completely mix the ensemble roles. The result is a plot that seems crooked. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a great choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her creaking voice and horrible hairdresser, was just pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> Color kinematics are conventional. But there were lots of shots using the rear fender protrusions that contribute to a dated look. The pictures are made even worse by costumes derived from cheesy 1950's "glamor"; they are just awful. Viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot point that reinforces how the film's director was beaten by the fragile tones of color. <br /> <br /> And then there is the orchestra. In what is probably the worst movie opening in cinema history, the first part of the movie has an orchestra that plays some boring sound. First, I thought I was looking at the introduction to future attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra plays on and on and on. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever to do with history. What did they think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe, with her breathless voice as she bimbos the way through the plot. But the movie would have been much better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles, dumped the orchestra, improved the comedy dialogue, and downplayed these flashy, cheesy costumes.
