This extremely low budget monster flip centers around a group of mine explorers exploring an abandoned gold mine to see if it is worth reopening. They are trapped by a cave and find that they are gracious by a strange, slimy creature that seems to be bent on knocking them from one at a time. The word that most people came to think of when I watched this movie was 'desperate'. The script and the play are terrible, the stop-motion monster effects were unintentionally fun, and as the bulk of the movie goes underground, the sentences convincingly seem like a logistical nightmare. All that was said, but for some reason I felt that this movie did not succeed, not from lack of effort, but perhaps from either lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. It all came as if it were either a college project or a first movie made by amateurs, I have some love for movies that way, even though they totally miss the mark. I guess what I say I give it a B for effort and a D for actual results, not insultingly bad as some low budget monster movies I've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands. I agree with that one 4.
