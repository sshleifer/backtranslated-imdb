I've seen movies from the last 10 years, and I have to say that I never felt so bad as I felt after seeing this extra-large drill movie, it was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs. No one should watch this movie. The director has shown the Germans to speak English, which is so nonsense. The Germans do not speak English & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have given some money to her) In the promotion, they have been shown to prepare for Laughing riot. But I could say that there was only one scene where Himesh was laughing for no reason, maybe he thinks he's funny. Hansika is very good. she is like an angel but too young only 16 years old. If you have plenty of time and do not know what to do, you should see this movie otherwise its a waste of money
