You must give it to author-director John Hughes. With the tremendous success behind him in the misfit teen / high school vein, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy, finding a great ally in comedian actor John Candy. Here, caste-adult Candy becomes a better person after accepting to babysit his brother's wiseacre children; It's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens and their parents, and it's no wonder the movie was a winner with the theater audience. Yet, Hughes is almost entirely dependent on Candy's charm to put the scenario over, and you can gradually get tired of the repeated gags with the star's front and center. The kids are sitcom-wise, the other adult formless lumps, and Amy Madigan is too intense, also hyped-up plays Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later, a television series that fits, became the material already TV-perfected. * 1/2 from ****
