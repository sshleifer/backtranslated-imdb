Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His appearances in days of wine and roses, the occasion, some as it is hot, lacking (to mention the first to come to mind) were all worthy of best actor nomination. His only victory was for Save the Tiger, and it's a shame. He becomes melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. In fact, he made a similar character much better at the end of his career in one note Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As for the film, the wonderful support of Jack Gilford as Lemmon's partner and Thayer David as an arsonist goes for nothing, because the rest of the manuscript is a confused clump of cliched vignettes, anxiety, neurotic nostalgia , and meaningless moralization. Worth seeing once as a time capsule in the 1970s style experimental direction of Avildsen.
