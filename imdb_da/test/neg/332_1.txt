I had known Brad Linaweaver in Florida State U in the early 70's when he was an inspirational, inventive writer whom I thought was on the way to greater glory. And so I rented this video. Well, yes, time has not been kind to Mr Linaweaver. I suppose the pressure to live makes higher hopes consumable. Another flower whose flower has come and gone without notice in the summer breeze. Amen. There is no more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph to a once flourishing career as mentioned above. But it is the price you pay for hunting shadows without a solid foundation or goal for yourself in life. Because this movie has no purpose, no purpose, and I kept telling myself what happened to Brad's creativity, his once shining genius? Gone, gone, years of neglect have worsened his once shining mind.
