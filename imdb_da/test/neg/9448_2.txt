I watch a TON of movies and enjoy the occasional B movie, but this movie was horrible. Apart from the film's "homemade" quality, it was very slow and didn't seem to do anything. I only comment on the b / c of another comment I saw here that said it was amazing! WOW! Maybe OK to look at a rainy day when there is nothing else available. <br /> <br /> The characters were incoherent and did not match any distinctive pattern of reality. The dialogue between characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I guess if you were a lot into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances of other commentary reference, it might be good - but for me - The average Joe - I don't understand!
