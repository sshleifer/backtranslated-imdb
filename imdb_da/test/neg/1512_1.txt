As a Christian, I found this movie to be totally embarrassing. The actors sucked, the writing sucked, cinematography sucked, and the story was so typical. I couldn't say this is a good witness tool because I would be too embarrassed to show any of my missed friends. Hollywood has much better things and that is because they invest best in it. Christians do a good job and think it's OK because "it's for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people used large amounts of money to bring gifts to God. David (or Saul. I can't remember) used what would be about $ 50 billion in today's money to build a temple for God. But these days it's just pathetic to use what seems to be about $ 30,000 tops on making a movie "witness" to people. It is the person not the product that affects anyone. Don't waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. If you want a positive impact with people, show them movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc. Movies that have something to say and actually get it into you.
