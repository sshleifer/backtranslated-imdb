Uzumaki, who translates into "spirals", arrives within this new wave of Asian horror movies after such hits as Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes .. and much more come as Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters ), the ghostly, supernatural thriller that is so characteristic of the other films lacks the only thing left is strange and not in a Tim Burton or David Lynch kind of way, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> It starts with a girl, another child in love with her, her best friend and his father, obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens relates to Uzumakis, people die, and you see Uzumakis. So okay, it goes along with it, I taste a bit of spirals myself, characters don't seem to go anywhere but I play together. We find out, the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is Uzumakis is everywhere, the film is a disaster, it doesn't know where to go except to show you the power of Uzumakis !!!! !!!!! There are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints, but then there is another scene where she hears her husband (from beyond the grave !!) telling her she also has Uzumakis in her ear , the way they are handled, that the scene was just ridiculous, not even cheesy fun, there are also some (a little bit) cool pictures that the collection father has of Uzumakis and the girl with the Uzumakis hair. Yep, Uzumaki's hair, it's out of context but it looks like it was taken out of a Fruit Snack commercial, where if you eat a Uzumaki fruit snack, its flavor is so incredible, your hair turns into Uzumakis, now if it was not so bad, suddenly out of nowhere there are snails men .. or mannequin ?? no matter what?? And you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ??. It left only enough time for a crazy anti-climatic end, and at that time I was sick of friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there, see you so much how many uzumakis can you find ?? If you want to see a movie about spirals, then see PI (3.1416) now that you find some beautiful, uzumaki concepts in between the meaning of life, and Dark City also has a little budding stuff in there. <Br /> <br /> This movie could have acted as a music video, it has already got a cult feeling, and so I was forced to watch it, but after that I'm not sure why people think it's great. I was really disappointed.
