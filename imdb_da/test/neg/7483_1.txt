I don't think I've ever given anything a 1/10 rating, but one easily gets the designation. I find it hard to just sit through one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but it combines with Carson Daily's zero charisma, can't create or finish a punchline, and you have a late-comedy recipe that will really make your stomach. <br /> <br /> I've seen the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. It just creeps on me after Conan. I usually look for a moment or two just to see if Carson is still the worst talk show ever. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you ever see him interviewing a guest, that's just an interview. I'm so sorry every time he has a guest and their confused smile is trying to mask their screaming body language, "Get me fucked away from this freak!" I recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but considering how he got in the air and what he still does there. Look as much as possible, I think you will find its complete awkward ... interesting.
