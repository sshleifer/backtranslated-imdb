The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was a great movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> As a love story, it sucks. Like having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. For me she was a librarian with a mini shirt and heels. She had no hard shell for her. She was not tortured, anxious, furious, starving or anything else. Her "HOOKER" character was as wrong as comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two just don't fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The only throw I felt was worth seeing was the 2 bitchy saleswomen who were well cast. They did a good job as I hated them in the few seconds they were on the screen. They had a real definition for the smaller roles. Okay, so the movie wasn't quite a garbage bin ... the two ignorant sellers saved the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from the two women, salesmen, the rest of the cast ... including the big names were just shit. Either everyone was an ass kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill in any dialogue in the movie except just to compliment Julia Roberts or kiss ass to Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> This was a movie about how to walk around high heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, teach people and boys working at hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat turned to their face. <br /> <br /> In fact, while the women dressed for the noses of Beverly Hills are more heads and prostitutes, but as they do not wear the ghostly Madonna who sees jewelry or patent boots, they can look down on the others that does. <br /> <br> The hotel cupboard was sadly sad to look at, and anyone who had a genuine character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas, and even to prostitutes who meet wealthy customers daily hoping to make their lives work perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story is about Christmas Ia Roberts becomes PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a costume and limousine. <br /> <br /> She's still owned, still telling how to act, how to move, what to have, what to say, where to say, and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the people of Disney / Buena Vista scoop it up to make it easier to swallow. Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attach√© case, this film would be about how a woman should fight to get away from the harshness of prostitution. The same story, different characters will make a very different perspective. Oh yes, change the white man to a black man or Asian or Spanish if the country's business deal is changed to a number of weapons or drugs and the whole concept of romantic comedy is thrown away. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still dirty, dressed with ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I didn't 'I like it 15 years ago when I didn't understand it and was led by Hollywood hype. I hate it now that I can see past the beautiful decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It is a story of how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my TV screen. <br /> <br /> Do I hate it? Yes. Sucks it? Yes Would I recommend it to you? NO ... yes maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be sent? See you. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
