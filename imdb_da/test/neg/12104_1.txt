... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the received print. "Not so ..." I was told. "The director wants it this way". <br /> <br /> Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school elective (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the original dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details in my understanding of a few keywords. <br /> <br /> I rated this as a "1", primarily due to irony from a director who once worked on subtitles refusing to put subtitles in a movie seen by an American audience. Excuse me, although most Americans would not know where Europe was on a map, not even a film festival's audience should know the "mother tongue" of a given movie. Although some of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" that are not sophisticated enough to have expertise in the 37 different languages ​​being presented. I want to put up with this ego from David Lynch, not from Litvack.
