Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My wife and children showed true promise in their first season and only went down the hill after that. It is so bad that words do not describe. The play and the writing are so horrible in a consistent way, I wonder if Damon Wayans produced such a terrible show on purpose. From top to bottom, every achievement is ridiculous. Damon Wayans phones it all in and George Gore II is so horrible that I crawl on every assault line. Can anyone really see this show and think it's entertaining or fun? Please, please. Don't see this show. As soon as television branches stop downloading this in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute garbage.
