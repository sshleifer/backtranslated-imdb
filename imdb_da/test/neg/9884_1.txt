This movie was boring. Much like Underworld, only less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and not where near a horror movie. The main couple were boring. I didn't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the movie. The reason was paper thin. The transformations were basically zero. I liked the wolves themselves, could just as well have done a wolf documentary, I would have liked it better. I would not recommend this movie. I didn't find it fun or interesting. It just pulls and everyone in it is a boring feature. This movie can win a prize for not making a werewolf movie.
