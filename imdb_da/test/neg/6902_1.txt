I can't find any redeeming value for this movie. It seems to be loosely based on Lion King's mindset. Father gets killed, son can't fill his shoes and tries to run away etc. Etc. Contract. The only difference (apart from being in a yard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard is trying to "live things up" with the club-type music. They go way above the top of trying to be cool. The problem is that it's really not cool. It's like "the guy". Everyone knows at least one of the "guys" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a cautious attempt to cling to their youth. They are trying to be tough to fit in, but they really aren't. It's this movie. But hi, if you have money to burn and you want to pay someone to suck 90 minutes of your life away, then don't stop.
