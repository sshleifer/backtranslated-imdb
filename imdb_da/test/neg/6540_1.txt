"The Puffy Chair" was an extremely waste of 84 minutes in my life, which cannot be retrieved and used in a more dignified way (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a better use of life's precious moments). It should be called "The Puffy Chair" because only "soft" chairs could accommodate the extremely "puffed-up" self-esteeming brothers who drooled it out for public consumption; And of course they are so full of themselves that they have assumed that the public would actually need to consume their stuff. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" seems like a cinematic masterpiece! "Dolls Valley", "Dolls Valley", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Living Dead Night", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob" - all of these would be better to spend your time than to see "The Puffy Chair." The depicted figures are either too predictable or lacking in normal, emotional reflexes to get close to being sympathetic or trustworthy. Also at some point in the movie, while the characters must be in the same small town, if you look closely, you can see that part of the city is apparently in the southern United States, and the other half is located in Maine. It's a city, eh?
