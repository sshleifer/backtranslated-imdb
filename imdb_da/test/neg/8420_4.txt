Quite unpleasant, but unfortunately monstrous satire of detective film, with stony-faced Michael Caine playing a British writer of trashy crime stories traveling to the Mediterranean to help write in the memoirs of a wild gangster; Soon he realizes he is being followed and his life is in danger. Caine tells the case with very worn and vulnerable sarcasm, but his actual performance is energy saving (Caines sharp outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and he connects with nobody on the screen). Other role players (especially Mickey Rooney, a silver-haired Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) do well in colorful rollout, although Al Lettieri has an abusive part as an apparently homosexual cross-dressing (Lettieri is offended without being able to defend himself itself, an inevitable position). Writer director Mike Hodges has a good idea (satirizing detective film from the 1940s without compromising on the hard-boiled talk and environment), but he does not have a very sharp sense of humor. When a Bogart lookalike - who asks a question about a falcon - is the best joke, this is anemic. ** from ****
