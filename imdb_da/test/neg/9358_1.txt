This very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the theme of the movie). No one comes into this movie knows what they are for. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way into the movie, no one still has a clue as to what they're inside because everything up to that "moment" is another movie. <br /> <br /> As a foremost fan of Dutcher's first two films that eventually competed for the best 2 Mormon movies to date (competing with Saints and soldiers and now the New York Doll - so that by screening) Dutcher wanted me to watch his movie for a very long time. I was there. I would think I would see the next big Mormon movie, one that would keep the Numero Uno place for a very long time. But no. Three quarters of the film took the sharpest of the left turn and dragged me through something I would never go through. He takes on Mt. Everest of all moral problems, yes both, with little time or emotional capacity left to address them adequately, but instead they both wave with a nod to Jesus, as if it will do all things well right away. (It is true that Jesus rescues. Don't let me blame me for not believing it. It's not Dutch's problem.) Is the movie shot well? Yes. Are the actors acting? They traded their pants. Was the music appropriate? Everything but what was over the final credits. Everything about this movie was amazing, except for the story, which was so good and wrong that everything else didn't matter. (I learned "dank" from the New York Doll, very decent show, by the way.) The third act of the movie was neither desirable nor pleasant or belief affirmative. I know that the Dutch bent backwards to do so, but I was so pushed out of the movie at the time that nothing, nothing, could have brought me back. The creepy infidelity of dozens of details in the final minutes did not help. Anyone who has been on mission knows what I'm talking about, especially someone? Spoiler Alert? Are familiar with events around someone sent home from a mission early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if a parallel universe suddenly sprang up where normal rules or behaviors do not suddenly apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million things that are good for this movie, but they were created and admired only to be trampled on and thrown away in a knee-jerk fit of "ooh, this will really get them "elitism. Therefore, unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher puts the finishing touches to his next movie ("Falling"), he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that they are the fans who pay the bills. Therefore, the first army of God was such an unqualified success. Holland's shock and awe-inspiring approach shows that when it comes to the big problems, he is in the way of his head and neither the spiritual or creative maturity nor business understanding is necessary to take them on. I ask you to pray! He learns his lesson and the years from now he and we all look back with a chagrin and rejoice that he has pulled his head out of where the Light does not shine and really does take on these and other issues and changes the world forever because of of the.
