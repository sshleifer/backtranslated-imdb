The previous review is largely on target, which Altman was not with this movie. I haven't seen it since its original release, but I've rarely spent two hours in a theatrical sensation as miserable and disappointed as I was with this movie. If some pretentious community theater tried a sci-fi version of an Ingmar Bergman movie, it might come out like this. I can't bring myself to give everything Altman has made a "1", but it's probably a career that has had some remarkable heights and lows. I would have gone out, but as a paid film critic I could not. (Think about the next time you envy movie critics.)
