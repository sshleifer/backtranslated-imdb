This movie is a disaster in a disaster movie. It's full of amazing action scenes that are meaningful only if you throw away all the reality. Let's see, for the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you You can't stand beside lava. Redirecting a smaller lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me into thinking that some might actually think what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this movie. I think the play is actually very good. The effects are above average. It is hard to believe that anyone is reading the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted. I think my suggestion would be that if this movie is starting on TV ... look away! It's like a train wreck: it's so terrible that when you know what's coming you just have to look. Look away and spend your time on more meaningful content.
