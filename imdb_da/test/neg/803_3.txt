Without being really the worst science fiction movie ever made, or the worst I've seen, 'Time Under Fire' is still much below average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it starts as an X-Files story that combines Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. Exactly blending elements from other genres (too many) together, but the story never goes beyond the interest of a television series. Shortly, 'Time Under Fire' rapidly degenerates into a series of cliches that not only mix too many genres but also be able to create something memorable in excitement or special effects that will help viewers remember the movie until morning. To act is bad, and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.
