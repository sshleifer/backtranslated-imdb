It must say something about our nation's state that this program is one of the most popular screened at this time. <br /> <br /> The 'square' is popular with such a miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, spiteful, unintentional dour group of characters that one can imagine. Everyone sticks someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to cheat someone. It or they are stung, thrown or dropped. No one is cheerful. No laughs. No one has a dazzling stroke or a really good day. It's hell with cockney accents. I suspect this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. It's the perfect view for the depressed. They do not welcome them; What it does is to present a whole community of such finally monstrous sad-asses that the viewers are moved to believe that their mass could really be worse - they can live in 'Albert Square'. <br /> <br /> Except over; as a representation of London's eastern end, it is pure loft. The programmers have apparently never been across the city. The first thing you encounter on Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this beautiful well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a scattered and rapidly falling minority. A large ad hammer currently near Bow Road flyover and sponsored by Tower Hamlet's Health Care boasts that 'Eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor faster'. Ten healthy, smiling faces radiate down on the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark-skinned ... I also used to work with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon - I dare say 'pukka' kayneys some years ago. And I can tell you that a more challenging racist experience I've never had. Every day was like an Oswald Moseley rally. They could not pass 5 minutes without denying a race or nationality other than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' unions 'Maceroons' was the little conversation. In fact, their entire (and extremely limited) population of adjectives is fixed to the genitals and their use. Alf Garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison. A program that claimed to represent London's native Eastern Caucasians in their true nature would be utterly unsuitable for broadcast - even after 9 am. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you would be somewhere near the mark. But since they were not inveterate bigots, they were at least extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I don't know how such a soap opera came. This imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing on real culture at all. And if you have a relatively sanguine disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. Relatively common actors pretend to be fairly common chronic depressive with cockney accents - what is that? <br /> <br /> Sad, boring, accidental disillusional and ethnically confusing. The most popular program for a seemingly sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague.
