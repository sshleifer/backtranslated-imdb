OK, I was bought this a few Xmas' side of my brother-in-law who took me to see "Get Shorty" in the cinema, as both applications were "uber" impressed. And then both became shorter and cool. I've read reviews of people who haven't seen, get shorty and thought this movie was pretty good .... I just think it's another way for movie companies to cheat the paying customer. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chili Palmer had become a pussy .... The writing was pretty much the same, they merged Travolta and Thurman after their success with Plup Fiction, threw a few big stars (plus a cut load of nobodies) and believed that it would be good ..... Vince Vaughn's character was just annoying, although I was a fan of both him and Rock both actors were way under exploited and unrealistic. I am basically happy that this was bought for me as a gift as if I had paid money for it, I would have been very annoyed.
