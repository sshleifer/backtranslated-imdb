Brigade? Yes, it and the movie it stares in. Hell would seem infinitely more intimidating if the condemned were forced to see this throughout eternity. Six college students are throwing up on a condemned hospital to save money and end up sacrificing an old monster to claim five victims before returning to "the shady world from which it came!" In addition to having great logical and coherence problems (plus the fact it seems to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and directed, and the make-up FX is almost non-existent. It's also significantly shorter than it claims (in just 80 minutes), but I'm not complaining. It's the worst movie I've seen from executive producer Charles Band's Full Moon productions, and the boy is BAD! <br /> <br /> I hardly noticed that I had a review but it has got inexplicable good reviews here and I figured a varying opinion was okay. Proceed with caution!
