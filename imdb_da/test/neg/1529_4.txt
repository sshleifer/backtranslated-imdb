First of all, season 1 is unacceptably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional, they are almost transparent, and the direction is horrible. It runs like a bad video of a junior high school play, characters wander past the camera and emit very timed and repeated lines, passing as a random prison test. Soon the view will be better, but not too much. The return from the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue at the Augustus Hill wheelchair bound, which is impressively played by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is consistently bad is under the poor performance art monologues, most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass box and generally have nothing to do with what is going on in the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the bad ideas in Oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes. Consider the whole situation first and foremost. Prisoners are able to hang out in the ordinary sight of being filled, putting drugs, and they not only have CD players (CDs? They may as well pass steakknive), but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards who don't do much. <br /> <br /> At the end of season 2, an older father-in-law is diagnosed with leukemia and all the prisoners are in thick wads of $ 20 and $ 50 bills to help him send him to Disneyworld to meet his dying desire. These must be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prison in Oz suddenly became caring, loving guys except Kenny Wangler, an annoying character, but one of the only ones that is consistently convincing. Even Adibisi would be nice. But it is okay because there is no order or feel in the show, so even that is not much of a distraction. Later shocking, there is a boxing scene where an inset has a "I love Cops" t-shirt. In prison!! Can you imagine ?? I have a cousin who was in prison some years ago. I sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school, and in the picture one of my friends held a "I Love Cops" and one of the "forest" (men who have been in prison for year and year) saw the picture, but just grabbed it and tore it to strips. My cousin got lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also praises the guards and even more senior officers not to call him the Brick. One of them even tried to bribe him to go to an English class. You can lose sight of who is responsible, the prisoners or the guards. For example, more than one investigator enters the prison undercover and is killed for stopping drug trafficking. Personally, I just wanted to stop allowing prisoners to inspect incoming mail rather than risking the investigators' lives. <br /> <br /> Let's see what more? Shilling the son of the NPD is in solitary, and no one is thinking about asking the guard how he got drugs. He just ... got them, I think. And be aware, otherwise you will miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums. I didn't know that maximum security prisoners were offered such luxurious treatment options. What about this when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's schedule so he can ask which breed of gums he was given is Faraj so scared that he goes to the workshop and finishes his work on the spot. Do doctors and dentists have no right to request not to see certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly have announced the entire prison, Robson asks to see Dr. Faraj, and being escorted to his office, brought in without knocking, and the guard immediately left without words. They might as well give him a gun. I shouldn't go on stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, I can't stop it. Who thought of the Chinese refugees who cannot speak Chinese and who disappear a lot from sight unless they are needed? Who thought of the foolish religious wars and all the reverent prisoners? Who about Robson's gum transplant? What is the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he clearly does not belong in the prison and Busmalis because of it all with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous end to end. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere that are constant. An Irish man comes to prison and builds a bomb. He threatens to burst the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a dud, and the episode ends up being carried away by the bomb crew after the entire prison has been evacuated. Nothing has ever been heard from him or about the whole situation again. It's like it never happened. In an episode catch dogs to train. What the heck?? If it wasn't bad, a guard burns his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. No one seems to think. <br /> <br /> I also like how anytime an altercation breaks out, the sinners are put aside, they say nothing, and the guards or sister Pete or the one who always says, "I hope you don't think I'll let it go !! " And then they go away and let it go. The audience can't remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a fat prison drama that can be better as a game. A short one. At least a low budget film. There's just not enough here to maintain a multi-season TV show. Then again I saw six seasons of it on DVD. Sometimes I don't understand myself ...
