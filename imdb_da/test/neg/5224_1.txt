This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. I know people are talking about how horrible Ed Wood movies were (Plan 9), but this movie makes Plan 9 look amazing. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes a como why I have no idea. Maybe destroy his movie career. Except for Chuck Norris, the movie's episode of extras in daytime and Mike Norris ... is right, Chuck's son. This director does not even have a resume, and I have no idea where the plot or manuscript originates from. This must have been greened by a horrible southaptist minister who somehow had a 3rd cousin who owned a studio (which I certainly have been shut down). <br /> <br /> I don't really know what more to say about this movie. I'd like to give you a summary, but I'm lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... something eternal battle. Apart from that, there are Indians. And a bunch of freaky kids who don't know how to act ... they're just awkward and shouldn't be on camera. I don't know what was going on most of the time, but I know the movie was a great laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on his bike) into the street somehow ... but in the shot he is in the middle of the park. That way, she learns to ride her bike with speed similar to The Flash and hit by a car or bus ... I don't know. But she's dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds sick, but when you see Mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in horror ... you'll understand. It doesn't show that the daughter gets hit or something ... you just have to assume she's hit a vehicle. But the film is not ready. So maybe it was completely independent and she died of cancer. Anyway ... after that, the movie becomes really confusing and I have no idea what really happens. I am a Christian and I have no idea why this movie was made. I see no value for this film in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing they show students in film production 101 ... that's what you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Just see it ... you'll hate it and me for what suggests you see it.
