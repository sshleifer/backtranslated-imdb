Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty believing in the under-mock performances called by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and may be completely confused by Bodrov Sr.'s choppy and confusing script associated with uncharacteristic weak direction. Most of the characters walk through the movie as if they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It's also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced an iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited. This is a horrible mafia movie; so much that it makes GODFATHER III look like a winner in the genre. To see the most important Russians at their best, check out Bodrov Sr.'s work at PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's VOR tour (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.'s new BRAT criminal.
