When Jim Wynorski first announced that he would make a new successor to my favorite series all the time, the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, I was ecstatic. I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. Then the production and very small pieces of the shot began, and the actors involved were released until the shot was packed. Then the announcement changes a title. No longer will this new successor titled "Slummer Party Massacre IV", but "Cheerleader Massacre" instead. I was a little disappointed, but having another title would be a very small price to pay for a movie I had been waiting for so long to happen. I was still extremely fascinated and on the edge of my seat to see it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a month ago, some very sophisticated copies of the movie were released to some very lucky viewers who came to watch the movie months before the release date. A few reviews were leaked online and judged by them. I began to worry about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre". Tonight I saw the movie for the first time in full length, and I still scrape my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely not a new episode in the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a slasher flick all on his own. And bad. <br /> <br /> Before I get into the movie's details, let me first say what a huge fan of Jim Wynorski's movie I am. I always thought he was a real camp boy, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made on shoestring budgets and do not contain the most upscale actions, but they are fun anyway. They are what they are: campy movies you see when you want to be good. Jim has produced the goods from more than one apartment from "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die" to "Chopping Mall". One of the reasons I was excited about this movie being his latest project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films I have seen this director / writer create in the past. First, the production was extremely cheap, and the film was actually shot at videotape, something I had never seen Jim do before. The actors were mediocre, at least, and the story is almost ridiculous. The murderer is also extremely stupid and reminds you of your cozy old grandfather, rather than a runaway lunatic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is full of female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about, people. But some of the boob shots seen here seem almost like they were finished on time. There is an extremely long shower scene that includes a cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it largely reflects a shower scene in Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II." The girl baths herself almost the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely cliched, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in HUNDREDS of former slasher flicks. A guy and a girl come out on the verge of completing their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are broken in pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I have never really considered a huge actress, initially gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her little como. We can talk about possible cue cards here. She recalls some incidents that her character exhibited by the killer seen here twenty years ago by police while recording the original "Slumber Party Massacre". Why was footage from the original movie used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions seen in this movie, which I'm almost certain was recycled from other movies. <br /> <br /> Not only does this movie reuse FOOTAGE from previous movies, but also reuses scores from other movies as well. Some of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also reused before "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the movie. There are also at least two more that I can't identify, but I'm sure to have been used before. <br /> <br /> Having been through this movie's horrible acting, ridiculous story, non-existent gore / special effects and camcorder-like quality, I have some serious concerns about Mister Wynorski's career. Has the man who delighted the audience with movies in the past finally lost his niche? It will show time. Oh, and let's not forget his latest movie. A new episode in the "Sorority House Massacre" films, now titled "Final Exam." I think I see a pattern here ...
