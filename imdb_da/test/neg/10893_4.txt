A young couple decides to switch to sunny California. They never reach their destination as they decide to retire to Rest Stop. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on entering a resting place. When she is ready to leave, she goes out of the bathroom to find that her boyfriend has disappeared with their car and left her trapped on Texas's back roads with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of the cheap and sticky horror movies that can become a cult classic. Will the rest Stop become a cult classic you might ask? Reaching the three elements you need to become a cult classic is gore, sex and artistic profit. Rest stops have shovel lots of gore, and while I don't want to give away too much, it contains oak of blood-washed nastiness. This movie has everything from the bad guy running over a policeman with his cars several times to him using a pneumatic exercise on a girl's legs. At times, it can be as bloody as a movie can get. It also has a free and yet rather intimate love scene in the opening hours of the film. Therefore, the meat is covered. Now the hard one? Does it have any artistic profits? You will never see the evil guy's face ?? You see glimpses, profiles, shady silhouettes. He is a faceless, relentless monster who alone scores high on the artistic grading scale. The movie has very few characters in it except for the main character? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Using a large part of the movie alone, she cannot reveal her thoughts during a conversation, but must speak loudly so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking. At times this can be a little annoying; However, it is a brave step by the author (John Shiban) and it works for most of the film. As the audience knows that being completely alone and isolated from civilization is scary enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic kills. So, Rest Stop will become a cult classic? It will probably because the coast, sex and argumentative artistic merit also has lots of chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouts on the screen, as the protagonist does lots of things you shouldn't do when you run from a psychotic killer. (What fun is horror movie if you can't complain about the victim's stupidity?)
