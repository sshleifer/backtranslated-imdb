I am a sucker for mob / gangland movies so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train wreck. With all the big name actors in this movie, I can't believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically towards the end of the movie. The actor better known as Zues or the big guy from the Ice Cube movie "Friday" does an incredibly overactive job throughout the movie. The first thing I told Blockbuster when I returned to the movie was to remove this waste from their shelves. Don't rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours in your life. If they come out with a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I want to be more careful about renting so-called mob / gangland movies.
