At the bottom end of the apocalypse film's scale, this piece of pish is called 'The Final Executioner'. At least where I come from. A blocker is trained by an ex-policeman to seek revenge on those who killed his wife and friends in cold blood .. and that is about it. Lots of false explosions and repeated shootings follow. Have one of the strangest selection of costumes I've seen in a movie for a while and a massive fortress that apparently only runs by 7 people. Good job at dubbing for guys (!) Best moment: When our hero loses a swordfight and is being skevered through his neck, he just comes out of his gun and BANG! Why not do it earlier? It's a mystery. As is the reason why someone wants to sit through this in the first place. I'm still astounding over one even now .. 2/10
