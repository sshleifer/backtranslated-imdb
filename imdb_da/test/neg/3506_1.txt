*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen since last year "The Village." An insult to any of any intelligence at all. Poorly written and amazingly constructed. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles, talks about how these characters do. No wonder at all. If the point of this movie is to say that "we all have a little bit of bigotry in us" he does a terrible job of stating the obvious. Not only was his point clear base, but every character in this movie was wonderfully stupid. The car jacking scene almost made me go out with rescue and oh, let's not forget the WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP and download a scam and I could go on and on again. Awful, just awful.
