It is generally not my practice to browse movies that I do not like greatly. But once or twice a year I temporarily hold my rule to comment only on things I like to give a warning word. I find it more comfortable to comment on something I like and increase it than I shoot at bad movies. But some "movies" shout at the shaver. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. The cinematography is not the only aspect that is blurred and out of focus here. An almost inseparable plot (certainly incoherent if there is even one) bad acting, cheesy script and horrible pacing. These are the biggest problems. <br /> <br /> Understanding, I firmly believe that not all movies are created equal, and movies must be judged by their category. It's not fair to judge, says Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in his weight class. Measured against movies like Emmanuelle or Secrets of a Chambermaid, it comes out very badly. Even eye-candy must be entertaining and bilitis is definitely not.
