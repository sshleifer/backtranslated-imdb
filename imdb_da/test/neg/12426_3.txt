What can I say about a movie as bad as this? The people who made this movie did not even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never look more than your head, and the head is just a giant doll that has little movement except when it opens it to roar. And the sound they used for roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter is flying over! I couldn't believe it when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink. In addition to the horrible-looking monster and the sounds it does, there is little more to this movie except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy shooter attacks the kids and tries to get an intimate moment in his castle. Still it can be seen if you like this kind of trash. I know I do ....
