It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script. The other half of the movie is just about a rehash of the first, making the movie very boring. In summary: Cop's daughter is suckered into party through the chatroom, where she is sexually molested / tortured by psychopath (played by Snider). Cop saves her, psychopath is put in therapy / prison. Psychopath is released four years later, and the whole thing is played out again. In all these are many inexplicable plural elements: Why was "Captain Howdy" psychic in the first place? What is the one-time detour to Bible trumps? How does he kid all the adults and manage to sew their mouths closed without a fight? And perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery for everyone ... how does a 6'2 "pink-haired man hide behind a 5'6" average-built woman? These are just some of the questions I had seen on this movie. It seems that Snyder tried to make some kind of comment on a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores, and c) the effect our transformed Puritan society has on us as individuals. If so, he failed. The movie is just too badly done to entertain Torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering on stupid (especially when Snyder enters one of his "pain and death" monologues), and everything else is just stupid. The "call tracking" scene is really boring ... when should the police get caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the protagonist is very horrible ... he should not act as an actor, basically. And the sound of the last showdown scene is really bad. I suppose they couldn't afford two boom mikes? The rest of the play is not terrible, but it is not good either. The police are quite a note, and his detached quality is not entirely credible. Dee Snyder is actually not that bad, but he spins and cheats too much. Robert Englund (who deserves better way) puts in a somewhat entertaining performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you are a great Robert Englund fan, the movie is probably worth seeing just for him. Everyone else is forgettable. In summary, we have seen all these plate elements done before and done better in films such as SILENCE OF LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of them instead of seeing this turkey. 10.3. <br /> <br />
