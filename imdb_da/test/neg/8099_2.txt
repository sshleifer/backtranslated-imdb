First, nick-623 became the Pearl Harbor bomb in 1941, not 1942.

They were killed * before * the operation took place! Third - How did Lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? Fourthly - why didn't the Japanese kill him just instead of putting him in jail with a convenient like companion and surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use? This movie has some interesting moments in it, but when they explain what's going on, you've probably stopped watching. If not, you will not care.
