Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrew's picture in this movie. He tried to make her sexy not realize she was already. I think they were both still a little Irish, Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success by Camelot and was transferred as not being sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to overcome this belief. It comes to the point where it is almost fun to see Rock Hudson, which we all know was gay, kissing Julie every two minutes throughout this movie. It seems they were not just trying to make you think Julie was a femme fatal, but that Rock was just. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together, and the endless kissing scenes begin to spread one out. The second mistake they made with this image did not know what kind of movie they were making. It is almost three separate films. There is Julie's drama as the German spy tries to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of recordings of WWI vintage plans that are swooping about, and there are the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to believe he should insert into each of his pictures, whether appropriate or not. In this case, it was not. The only truly redeeming qualities in this movie are the always lovely Lady Julie and hear her singing in the crystal clear bubble-like soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can overlook the weaknesses of this movie just because of her. You can always tell yourself that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!
