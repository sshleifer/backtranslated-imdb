Don't try to see this one. I thought it was good because I am a fan of cheesy 80s movies and I have had some of Linnea Quigley's work. I was mistaken. I should have said "no" and saw Gigli instead, which is probably a much better movie. I suppose my biggest problem with this movie was its attempt at humor. Nothing about it was fun or even close to fun. The play is bad, even for the queen of cheesy 80s movies. There is no story, just random clips. I don't think I should hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece, but I didn't have any fun and I wasn't entertained once. I even had to fast forward to the end to get through the whole crap. I'm sorry, but I don't find zombies that do aerobic fun.
