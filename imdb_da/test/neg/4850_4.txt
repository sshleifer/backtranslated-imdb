Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and a highly gifted and versatile singer. Her performance in this film is more than competent and from my point of view on the only redeeming feauture of this film. She gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. But what I highly dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well-known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to go slowly without deciding what the movie is about and what it will be. With a positive note, you can argue that the movie is not predictable, but you can also say that it is totally boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some good shots in the film bow, you can't help thinking that all parts just don't add anything to anything at all. It's really a shame because Kaas really shines in this movie.
