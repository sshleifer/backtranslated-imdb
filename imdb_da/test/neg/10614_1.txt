I love these horrible 80's summer camp movies. The best part about "Party Camp" is that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak group of "signs" to a place, and then it happens at times. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): Nerds vs. Jocks, the secret camera in the girls' wardrobe, walkers who are in a nudist colony, the competition at the end, the secretly eerie tenants administrators and the embarrassingly silly sexual insinuation filled all the way through. The only clich√© missing is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never on purpose. I repeat, NEVER. A final note, be prepared to bust a gut sees the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late in the evening and spill their intestines to each other. The dialogue does not make sense, and the actor belongs to a high school phase. It's a classic.
