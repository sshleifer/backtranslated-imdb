This was more a love story than one about an angel coming down here on earth, although both angles of that story get a good deal of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I took this movie to heart, As someone who knows and believes in the Bible, I would have consumed it quite quickly, but I don't think the general atmosphere was either transparent or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta as an unclear angel? Smoking? Scratching his groin? Quote the Beatles? A "warring angel" who knows nothing about heaven? An angel flirting with all the women? Yes, it's all absurd and certainly Biblical - wrong. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all that, but I don't know how many people, regardless of their beliefs, who could stand a dull movie, as it turned out to be in the second half of it. It begins to draw when the romance begins between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell. Some of the dialogue under this romance is so stupid that it is insulting to any discriminating seer. <br /> <br /> This is another Nora Ephron directed movie. Man, I can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed. At least she is consistent.
