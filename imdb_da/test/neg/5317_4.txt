Dazzling silly guff from the formerly talented John Hughes, who will soon make a movie of sperm from 'Look Who's Talking' if his stars get younger. He reuses the "Home Alone" formula once again to produce this idiotic comedy where a baby makes his way around Chicago while outrageous kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to catch him along the way that holds very tiring slapstick. If Mantegna and Pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie, then you're in trouble, but the movie's laziness is most brilliant in the scenes, where crowds fail to notice a baby crawling around the pavement. Except nonsense.
