This movie is pathetic, not because it is badly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc. But because it is really hard to destroy a movie using an ABBA soundtrack - it is unfortunately the only thing the movie succeeds. The musical presentations in the movie SouthPark were much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't have the talent to be a director. All you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a try the horror: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the hard sunlight song and just destroying the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why make it one of the most talented actresses out there?
