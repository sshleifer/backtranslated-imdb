Don't make me wrong, the guy is a successful dynamo, but he came to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys for impulsive brats. So I am a little honored when he looks at cartoon fans as an extension of the same market. See, "The Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it was beaten on a Saturday morning and aimed exclusively at unclear children. But it is not exclusively aimed at children. Peripheral figures are killed every five minutes, and there is enough bloodshed and semi-naked bodies to make the net censors crawl, so it is not completely cut to the children's television. So what audience is this video aimed at then? It is the audience who enjoys closely understandable stories of reviving a tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 birch rings, that is who. And I think the audience is strictly small. <br /> <br /> Many good writers have passed Marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. So it's a shame that Marvel would risk their expensive animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and writers, who, like Mr Arad, are better used to sailing action figures during Saturday morning cartoons. How many lukewarm receptions should wonder before they get a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: Just passable cells, some segments are better than others, a low budget looks all the time - this is nothing Bakshi (Ralph) and is no Bluth (Don)! CG animation is okay, but far from impressive. History: a lithography of clich√©s, everywhere, coincident, constructed and uninspired. Sign: So why is Rhodes himself here, if all he does is add Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her father is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... Asian chickens are hot and seemingly slightly different; The female leader is thoroughly objective at the end of the function. <br /> <br /> Performances: Can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Species: very western muscles, very clean lines, faces are very derived from eastern art, very dull mats, very boring CG. Conclusion: Not great, but worth looking at the fans and those who enjoy superheroes. A "must-buy" for collectors. A valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.
