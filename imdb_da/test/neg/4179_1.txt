If you want to enjoy the money you want to use to rent this money, you need to buy a bag of ice cream and watch it melt. It's more entertaining than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, shame on you. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie plot, go in a cornfield, take two of the most annoying little girls you can find, run around for a couple of hours if the girls are screaming as loud as possible. Then send me the few bucks you would have used. <br /> <br /> After enjoying the sequel, I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, I will cry myself to sleep.
