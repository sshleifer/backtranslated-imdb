The movie is okay. That means I don't regret seeing it! I found the play clean and most of the dialogue stupid ("oh no, this was my grandmother!"). It's a kind of bad remake of the U-turn. A man comes to a desert town out of nothing, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. And out of the fact that few are involved in something, he thought he could leave him. The movie is pretty predictable and there really is nothing new in it. When it's finished, you didn't really like yourself. Most of the characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all just another movie from the states, but okay entertaining on the boring Wednesday night. IMDb vote: 4/10
