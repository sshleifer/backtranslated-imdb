I am very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. While it had some good features, I mostly found this movie to be heavily handed, predictable and worst of all, not at least scary. The first 30 minutes of the movie was promising, the actor did a good job in her portrayal, and the world around her was thoughtful and meaningful. Unfortunately, the film went into a downward spiral. I went into this movie with no idea what it was all about - didn't know anything about the actors, the directors, the genre, etc. At some point, my wife made the comment "should it be scary movie?". Well, I guess, since the chain horror movie scores full of creaking violins and expanded vibrato, nothing else could matter. There didn't seem to be a lot of originality in the movie. The romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the other half of the film fell deep into the ridiculous. A movie like this goes a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path or to jump off and just laugh at the laughter's laughter. In the last 30 minutes I chose the latter.
