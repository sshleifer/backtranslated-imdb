Naach A more detailed review can be found elsewhere on the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not quite agree with it. Taran is a commercial guy and thus only prospects from his angle. Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this seems like a pale reflection of one in some parts ... I don't even want to compare Urmila and Anthara .. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is gathering nicely. <br /> <br /> Anyways, I like Anthara character. She is true to her art, not affected by any unnecessary feeling and certainly not too practical. She is a dance researcher, in fact she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her with a scientist would offend her. Hi .. Donald Trump .. Maybe you should ditch Melania, here's Anthara, and you've already built a Taj Mahal ... isn't that easy? Abhishek, on the other hand, is a practical guy who wants money, power, fame, etc. Therefore, these two fought to pause in the film industry, cannot join their various styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in a scene! What is new? This film takes a different angle than the film industry and how different people come into it. There is always something else about RGV's movie, one is different, it's too slow for its standards. In parts it almost pulls one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Note! It's hard to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skinshow was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also looks like Anthara is a pro in Yoga, she is too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby improves as an actor with each movie. I'm sure his movie star blood pays rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music was above average.
