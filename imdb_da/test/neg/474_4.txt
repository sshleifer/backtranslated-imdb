I enjoy B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very attentive actress. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness' were fantastic movies. I liked running time. But I don't know if I will ever see this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, having said that, I'll bet on the comment tracks and special features will be worth seeing! This movie has just too many gaps so I can actually enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. First, Ted Raimi was annoying, just annoyingly annoying. There was nothing to his badly acted / written character that has not been made better a thousand times before. Unfortunately, the management was subpar and the choice of some shots ... yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell didn't deliver. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy this mindset, it was supposed to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall' but still I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got much less. At the end of the movie there were no scenes popping out to me, no dialogue that resonated within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.
