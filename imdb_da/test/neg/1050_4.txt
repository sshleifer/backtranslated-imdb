This is really a movie with two halves. The first mention of two boys' life and friendship (a privileged Pashtun and the other one plunged Hazara) into the late 70s Afghanistan before the invasion of the Soviet Union works extremely well. The young actors turn to convincing performances and see Afghanistan as it once threw the present situation there in strong relief. The real problem comes when we go into the later stage of the story where we join Pashtun as a man living in America. Old debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland, and it is really at this point that things are going down. The central adult character must obviously be sympathetic, but in fact come across as sharp and beasts in self-pity. It's hard to really care for him, and you can't help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we can't see - his girlfriend's friendship. When he returns to Afghanistan, he is being knocked down in a number of heavily engineered coincidences. Most notably, he manages to cross his childhood enemy after all these years almost instantly (though he is not looking for him), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This allows him to confront previous demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The decision of the narrative is also carried out with a horrible mawkish sentimentality that undermines all really serious points that the film can attempt to do. While it is possible to begin to see signs and abuses of their lives as symbols of a state torn apart by world politics, it is difficult to see this really as a film dealing with a wider political discussion. Instead, the narrative is reduced to a character's emotional journey of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and wrapped in itself that it's hard to really get involved in his story while opportunities for making a really interesting movie about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
