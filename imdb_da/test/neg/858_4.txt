"The Duke" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy, where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his great property and the huge wealth to be taken from him after the death of two incredible aristocrats ( Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Hello man); He leaves his Dukeship to his dog. The dog's "best friend", an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke because he is her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte instantly connecting to create a romantic part-plot, which in its own way acts as the undertone of the main plot like Hubert, The Duke's activities and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is monitored by James Doohan, who plays a Butler, determined to try to earn his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones as he looks and performs various ridiculous tasks during his new master. A fine comedian performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor. Although I technically dislike this movie, I have only looked at James Doohan's role. Although the plot is good, the elements of the writing and control must be immersed. If I ignore the absurdity of a "Doggie Duke", I personally do not like the use of comic and outrageous jokes on the "bad" signs because of their ridicule. The dependence on hygiene-related humor as you like is far too obvious, and the general sadness of many characters does not appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink often uses long shots with either an overdubbed voice or affects overall sound quality. Incidentally, Muirhead and Heyman's plays fall into the dramatic and romantic sequences, drastically short and meet the wholesale needs of the role. <br /> <br /> But as a mature movie fan, I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I found some fun and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched but has specific connections. I do not recommend this movie for mature movie fans, but I highly recommend it to dog lovers, families wishing to enjoy a fun movie for their child and James Doohan fans who want to see 'Scotty' in their final role.
