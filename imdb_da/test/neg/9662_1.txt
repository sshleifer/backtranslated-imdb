Calu-what now? Yes, I thought it was also a stupid name. Chris Carter remains blissfully ignorant of the foam in his writing staff. Beginning with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby being driven over by a train) this episode ... well I can't really say it goes downhill, to be honest it never went uphill. <br /> <br /> Poorly written, with us we felt no pathos for any of the characters (except perhaps the baby at first) making the author hats us before they brutally kill them, it's the worst technique ever. Should we be sorry for the signs that hate them? Do not ask me. <br /> <br /> It's not only boring and rude, but it's like seeing a really bad Omen sequel with overwhelmed and obnoxious death sequences and rotting special effects (though it's brutally honest, that's at least my concern) . <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno began his X-Files career with a nap, and fortunately it ended with one too. <br /> <br /> Rating: <br /> <br /> In words from my mathematics teacher Mr. Laverack: "Terrible, horrible ..."
