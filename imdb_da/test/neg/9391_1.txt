Got to confess right in front that I didn't see this whole movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I saved the first hour? The other reviewers sum this up nicely. It was very conceived. Bad scripted. Poorly acted. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was ADR. The whole movie, which seemed to be called, sounded like it was done in any garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words that just served to keep the bad dialogue going. And hang. And hang. Even one made for television movies should have recognized this. <br /> <br /> And the idea that alternative dimensions are differentiated by saturation went out in the 80s, folks.
