This movie is really pretty strange. Clearly certain * events * portray identifying the protagonist as the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost anything else is just wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of irreversible, documented facts. The question is actually why? Garda is shown as the last day of Keystone Cops, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as ... well Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction anyway, why bother trying to give a view of realism? Having said all that, it's a bad exercise * any way you want to look at it. Not worth a second of any time.
