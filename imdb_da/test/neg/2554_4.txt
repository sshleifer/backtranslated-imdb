If it hadn't been for Christopher Guest's hilarious role, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the film chopped and slow, some characters were unpleasant and painful to look at, but the character of the guest kept me laughing, so I was stuck. <br /> <br /> I feel there are much better choices out there!
