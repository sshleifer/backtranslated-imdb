Big Knife, a film about the dark side of the Hollywood movie industry, is ironically far more like a movie recording than a movie itself. Aside from a couple of very short show scenes, all the actions in the living room are done by the film's hero, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redemption of qualities in the films they postpone. His again, off again wife (Ida Lupino) is also tired of the studio, not to mention his husband's philandering ways. Unfortunately for both of them, the student student (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has extortion material to force the more tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it is only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, I do NOT repeat, a movie noir. Rather, it is an unusually theatrical living-melodrama. The plot continues at the snail's pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static attitude and carefully constructed blocking of the actual scenes. The spectacle is overwhelmed to the extreme and jumps sharply between out and out histrionics and softer, but no less uninhibited, soliloquies, which, of course, are meant to be exciting but come across as pretentious twaddle, especially in the hands of the violent miscast Palance. Of course, Aldrich had gone for a stylized "something" here, but I doubt he knew what it was and certainly the audience never did. <br /> <br /> I think the most important lesson here is that movies and plays are very different media. What might have worked in a game did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film. The result? A great waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
