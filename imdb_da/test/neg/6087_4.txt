How much do I love this movie? Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that's so bad it's good. This is one of them. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a good ass, looks amazing on the screen, and doesn't quite make a bad trip to his acting debut (I think). Billy Zane is appropriately mediocre and moody, though I still feel that there is something more in him. I felt it in the Titanic, the look of his face when La Winslet sprayed on him, for example, completely destroyed, shocked and worn ... violently! Kelly Brook is a beautiful face ... no seriously I think that's it! It's worth catching this to see a really hot guy, some great bro fillers from Brook, nasty growling from Billy, laughing at the dialogue, fearing in the wild and madness of the whole affair ... I'm gona, see it again now - Yes, I bought it !!!
