For yourself to say that this film is Sebastien's work at its best, just tell you everything you need to know about the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not entertaining at best yet very popular host on French television. If you look at any of his shows, just torture for any normally designed man, his first (greeting only hope) movie has proved to be just as worst. Sebastien's excuse for rape (the victim falls in love with his aggressor) is not only wrong, but clearly unacceptable. I strongly suggest that you don't bother looking at this picture (or any of Sebastien's future features), you just want to lose your time ... There's something about French TV that doesn't smell right ... and this is Patrick Sebastien !!!
