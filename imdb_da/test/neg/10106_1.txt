From the serious special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked on how bad someone can make a movie. Let's say that way, I have absolutely no direct experience, and for the first time ever, when I watched a movie, I thought, "I can do better than that! while you sat watching this cardboard. The action in this movie was horrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man, but the French guy from Aliens3 was then wood, I wondered how he got the first job in the first place. The story was mediocre, and I suppose, as most movies, if the rest had been done well, it would have stood up. I usually do not write reviews here but after watching a few people this movie gave a good rating (must be cast / crew) I felt I had to say my piece to save someone from accidentally hiring or wasting their money to buy this cack.
