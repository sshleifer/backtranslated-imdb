Oh no one of those attacks from the Japanese ghost girls ... I don't even remember how many I've seen. Maybe sell it ... but not for me. not scary at all. The Japanese horror films have been very similar since the first of these ... also training the child. I've seen that pulled the scene so many times in so many horror movies. cell phone scene is also nothing new ... the drama of the guy is hit by a train a little sucked ... i think it lacked all the dramaticness ... OK this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique ... let me tell you. there is a million of you = D this is one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse, but you won't miss anything by NOT seeing this!
