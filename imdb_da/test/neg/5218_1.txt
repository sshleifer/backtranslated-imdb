When you look at the production of this DVD - they tell you what has been tried here - they tell the Bible story of good against evil and try to preach it to a main stream movie audience. In a modern society like ours, this is where the film fails. There are far too many get depicted in this movie. People are also empowered to this kind of preaching today. <br /> <br /> As for acting, management and technical features, they are finished OK. Chuck Norris is actually OK as an angel like Norri's unpredictable appearance, as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s.
