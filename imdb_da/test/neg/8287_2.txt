A high school track star dies after winning a race; Shortly thereafter, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to note that her sister's sports team members are disappearing. Who could the killer be? You may not care enough to find out. Raw, cheap, amateurish slasher is just about totally worthless, though topbilled Christopher George (like the unpleasant, driving track) tries to give it a lift with intense performance. Not even gore is worth mentioning. It's all paralyzed from the beginning to the end, starting with opening the movie to a track that meets montage set to disco music, and casting E.J. Peaker, once a co-star in the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character named "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie". It may mean that we should not take the film seriously, but at least it is a shambles. It's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes "Friday the 13th" film looks like works of art in comparison. <br /> <br /> Seeing an early movie look of Vanna White, of all people, is the only point of interest. <br /> <br /> 2/10
