Thank goodness, I didn't have any heavy machinery, it could have been just the worst disaster. Shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same shot, mid-shot, mid-shot, middle shot, snooze. History line was pretty empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get the stupid accent? Random pictures of the scenery just to include them did not add much. There were several shots of Arbor who traveled in his car than anything else. The direction didn't really take us into any of the scenes & neither did it for any of the characters. I would have rated it a zero if IMDb had the opportunity. Great soothing if you can't sleep. There were 2 hours in my life, I will never come back.
