What a waste of talent - although Crudup seems to be much more like the daring, self-absorbed, characterless character he portrays in this disappointing movie. In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconsciousness and conflicting / competing, unresolved impulses / consciousness of the film's director / writer. It unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly developed, deeply-minded character must have and be plagued with telling the public empathy or sympathy OR the lack of being used to serve as a warning to the public. But this movie fails at any level in that respect. The fact that Cal, the protagonist (much an ANTagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense), has no empathy for anyone, especially those most deserving of it (which does not include him) and that he has such overblown, right , self-pity, whiney sympathy only for himself combined with the characteristics of the lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his influence on others - all converge in this film to make him the epitome of the self-involved, developmentally arrested narcissistic sociopath - on somehow it is now the gold standard for men on film and in the world at this time and time. <br /> <br /> One of his contradictions (James LeGros) says with a laser-true flash: "I bet you haven't done a good thing in life - and I don't know you don't" . It captures the absolute essence of the Cal character. Something the other characters he bulldozer into the movie seem to realize quite quickly despite the instructor stacking the deck to manipulate the sympathy of Cal. It is a testament to the supportive cast's talent and skills. Cal's any 'return' has nothing to do with the nature of development, transformation or evolution of consciousness. It only has to do with the ultimate surrender that until something better comes together, he may as well be back in his cozy, cozy status quo with just activation, where the living is easy, and no one will demand that he grow up - something of which he is intentionally incapacitated and uninterested in doing. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been pointed and deliberate in showing traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience / consciousness, but it apologizes and glorifies it instead - in fact it is in self-pity right along with the arrogant, selfish, emotionally stunned protagonist. <br /> <br /> (and it certainly sent shivers back when I thought about the recent revelations about convicted killer Scott Peterson). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Crudup in his most nuanced and full of exciting potential that has never been really realized in my opinion, see the underrated 'Inventing the Abbotts'. ...
