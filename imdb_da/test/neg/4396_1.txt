This must be one of the greatest misfires ever ... the script was nice and could be completed much better. The actors should have played better and maybe I would have given this movie a slightly better character. Maybe Hollywood should resume this movie with some better actors and better instructor. Sorry guys for disappointment, but the movie is bad. If I were to see it again, it would be like torture. I don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with my so .. my advice is to watch the movie first .. see if you like it and after voting (don't vote before you see it!) And by the way ... Have fun watching it! Don't just see ... see it to the end :))))))))))) !!)))
