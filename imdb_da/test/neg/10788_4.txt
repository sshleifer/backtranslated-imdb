Throughout his career, Hitchcock made great movies; It wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> A man knows too much, his daughter was kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement everything is solved to the accompaniment of rifle and drama. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the 1930s Fritz Lang movie - "M" come to mind - will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience lacks what had already been done in that genre at that time. There is a totally amateur air about much of the scene and action that undermines any kind of threat, darkness, and aggravation that Hitchcock might have attempted to instill. <br /> <br /> What is worth watching, though, is the sequence of shooting at Albert Hall. Once it is started, it is as if the film has had blood transfusion. The camera is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way everything combines into a climax is masterful. Here you can see the master of the future: Hitchcock orchestrates all the resources for impressive and memorable effect: When the scream comes, you also feel as good as hearing it.
