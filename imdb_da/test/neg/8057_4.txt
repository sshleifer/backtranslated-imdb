This film is about a young man's painful journey to discover his sexuality. The film is raw and unpretentious. It does not rely on steaming sex scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot may seem disjointed and disconnected at times and some events are not properly explained. I can understand, though, because this movie is a collection of memories that is very personal to the director. The sub-plot of whether his sister and mother probably don't have to exist in the movie, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life. The low budget of the film is clearly distinguishable. It's a pity that the sound effects are poorly done. The narrative and some dialogues (especially the classroom class with the French teacher) have so much echo, which makes it difficult to find out what is being said. The surrounding noise, notable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When a scene cuts into another, the level of traffic noise changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insight book for a youth's journey to embrace his sexuality.
