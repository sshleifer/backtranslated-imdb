Thanks to silly horror films such as "Troll" and the indescribably terrible cult-favorite "Troll 2", it has become virtually impossible to take movies with cobalt, gnomes and various other types of small green hobboblins seriously these days. Only recently did I watch 70-inch TV films "Do not Be Afraid of the Dark", which is basically a scary and serious toned movie about domestic small goblin monsters, and yet I still couldn't think about the laughs. -Inducing potato cooked ripples dressed in garbage scoops that were running amok in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to go into "Inhabited" with a clear mindset, I unconsciously continued to compare the seemingly eerie and threatening haves with the ill-sculpted goblins of the Nile book! Yet, even without all the prejudices, "Inhabited" is a distant entertaining, albeit unmemorable, straight-to-video horror flick. It is a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern European mythology. The annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie are not your regular average goblins; They are "hollows": evil little Norwegian demons living underground and trying to chase happy families out of their homes by influencing the youngest children. This overcomes the Russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream home in a remote little town. The Cherubian blonde daughter of MILF actress Megan Gallagher begins to behave strangely as she hangs out in the cute playhouse in the backyard of the garden. She claims that her friends are fairies, and even though the scary craftsman also warns of strange events in the past, Gina's parents simply believe the girl is having trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. As she continues to celebrate celebrations, she arranges an appointment with the renowned psychologist Dr. Werner, while "The Huldre" slowly comes out of their botanical shelter. Not particularly special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and the attempt to build tension is pretty sweet. You understand that this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequences appear graphically here. Heck, even the carcass of the family cat cat is kept outside the screen. This is the seventh nonsense horror movie in which Malcolm McDowell appears, and he almost always shows an unreliable, greedy and self-centered figure of authority.
