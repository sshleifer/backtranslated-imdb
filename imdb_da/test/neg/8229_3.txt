This is not a very good movie, but it is easily the best Troma Studios movie I have ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - "the brain" behind Troma - is not worried about a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining movie. His biggest concern is something bizarre. And his definition of bizarre often reflects my definition of horrible cinema. In this movie we have the title of Luther - whose favorite pastime is not baseball, but bites his head out of chickens - receives his release from locking. The board has considered him rehabilitated despite not speaking - he just cuts like a chicken - and has a set of razor blades at his disposal. Of course, when Luther is free, he goes on to cause chaos, first in a grocery store and later on a farmhouse. <br /> <br /> VALUE: $$$$$ (Lots of violence in this often tasteful Luther sinking his razorblades chompers into a poor older lady waiting for a bus stop and then using the rest of the movie to terrorize the mother and daughter in the yard). NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk delivers some remarkable skin in her image as the former Lois Lane (I can't remember which Superman edition she was from) gives us a shower scene followed by a body in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't do it I have no chemistry with Ms Haiduk.The extended shower scene footage in DVD extras gives the viewer a lot more of Stacy, she is something). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!!! Whitey Styles' play can only be the worst ever written. The way in which Luther is released from the asylum throws all credibility completely out of the window. Ogue is something that a preschooler can write, and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurdity. It is as if Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations.) ACTING: $ $ (The movie belongs to Edward Terry, who actually does a decent job as Geek. He is quite threatening in a stupid barnyard fashion. Joan Roth as mother makes a super job in support but Haiduk and her boyfriend lack chemistry have at best had their roles ).
