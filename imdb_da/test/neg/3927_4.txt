I preface by saying I am a big fan of JJL and not one of Patrick. That's why I saw this to see her performance and of course it was excellent. I didn't feel the director was adequate for the movie, as several very bad choices were made again: shot angles, blocking etc. If the instructor tried to give it a "realistic" feeling, they failed and lost some good ideas because of it. Almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from intense facial reactions - and so many times when the action was dependent on the intimacy of the protagonists, the dialogue was slow and plodding. This could easily have been resolved by cutaways or camera angle changes. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that scenes were shot several times, and the energy coming from the actors was ... exhausted.
