Well how to start? I saw the Italian job for the first time some years ago and visited a rental shop, I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. <br /> <br /> After voting for the reviews for this movie, I saw the statistics. Apparently, this film appeals mostly to under 18 girls. Not so strange. They didn't pay enough for Charlize to blink and I think some girls magazines have rated Mark Wahlberg's abs "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that this movie is completely predictable, the actors are mostly B-stars forever and even the good ones are abused terribly, the movie is full of obvious product placement and imagines it: it even manages to repeat without making a successor! The first 15 minutes is the best part of the movie, and it's all the way down from there, and once they've figured it out, they decided to spend the finest hour again eventually to repeat their details. All in all, very noisy about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good, and Ed Norton can be more like he has been before. In addition to Donald Sutherland's "look, I'm also here" appears at the beginning, I would say that this movie should have a "pass if you're over 18" all over.
