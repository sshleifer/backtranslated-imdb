This should be one of the very best horror movies. Charles Band made the best movie of 96 'in this little gem. Very realistic and incredibly stylized - with a visual flair, David Fincher would envy it, it's not hard to see why Band continued to make such classics as' Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil ',' The Regina Pierce Affair ',' Virgins of Sherwood Forest 'and' Timegate: Sales Tramps' stories. <br /> <br /> With a very sophisticated story - a small body with a big head controls a family of weird women who are attempting naked women, this movie can be a little too much for younger viewers and is only for the Most educated type viewer, but for those who see it, Band can convey subtle messages about the human state through his masterpiece. The head is symbolic of the lost love and longs for one's inner self, which we all must meet at some point, and therefore I could engage with this film at a deep personal level. Although many former critics have compared Band's films with Re-animator and other smaller works, this head and heels stand above the rest. There are gurus, but not meaningless. Gore in this movie is well designed and used to enhance the story, rather than just getting a cheap shriek out of the audience. Also the special effects in this movie are absolutely top notch, the best work done in a horror movie since ... well ... ever! The work of this movie makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind, eerie oboe. The only problem I have with this movie is the abundance of full frontal nudity that was ultimately unnecessary to achieve the composer's goal - to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest movie of the whole the time. If it wasn't for this little problem, I'd have given this movie a perfect 10.
