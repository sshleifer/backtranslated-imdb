So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a movie I hadn't seen or even heard of. <br /> <br /> Now I like slasher movies in general, but it's just immense, not even good at laughs. In addition to being ultra-ultra-inexpensive and containing all the slasher movie clich√©s and horrible plays, it has the most incompetent and eerie direction I've ever encountered. Sometimes the aforementioned features may be present in a movie, and there may still be some pleasure, but not here. Painful example of homemade horror.
