On a Thursday evening at 22:00, my local west coast was flying ABC to the pilot section "Northern Exposure". The ABC network usually floats "Men in Trees" in that time slot, but the program was biased to a live sports event. Despite both shows being set in Alaska and filmed in the Pacific Northwest (exposure in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC), reconsidering "Northern Exposure" (as well as few episodes of "Sex and the City") reminds me where disappointed I am with the poorly thought out hybrid "Men in Trees". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer ending in a small town in Alaska, laughs at my nerves. Perhaps because I feel that Heche is dissatisfied, I am not convinced of her "fish out-of-water" character. <br /> <br /> I also feel like supporting support fits the typical quirky stereotypes. The exciting local, the friendly bar-owner, the bush pilot, the local police officers, the weak but well-meaning radio DJ etc. The only stereotype that may have been broken was the teddy bear and the veteran "ER" actor Abraham Benrubi as the local bartender in love in two different women. Given that one of the executive producers is filmmaker James Mangold (his movie "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had leading characters who were big men), then I'm not surprised why Benrubi was thrown in a non-typical role. <Br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits the quirky niche for the television audience. I wanted the show to find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows.
