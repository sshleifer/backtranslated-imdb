For a good grip on the Roman Empire see the excellent BBC produced miniseries "I, Claudius". This just sucked. The action was pathetic, and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. His Matheson was annoying. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated prospects. Even Caligula was pretty. I think this movie was silently supported by "religious" groups that remain nameless;). The obvious tones of Christian favoritism and persecution were obvious if it gave a hint. Stay away from what you ever do - the maturity is so long that I could read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to see this trip. Italy has done better - don't let his sweet face fool you. He's not a big actor ... he's a big drill.
