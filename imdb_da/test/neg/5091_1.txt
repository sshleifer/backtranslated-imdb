For weeks I was looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself very disappointed by the departments. In my opinion, the only good thing was 'River Queen' because it was the amazing landscape that was used as backgrounds. The story was everywhere, Samantha character Sarah was very hard to understand, and what on earth were all the many close-ups of her face to? It brought absolutely nothing to the story - if there was one at all! A better actor for that part of Boy could also have been chosen, for me it sounded like he was reading his lines just about the manuscript while he shot his scenes. All in all, a real shame as it could have been such a good movie.
