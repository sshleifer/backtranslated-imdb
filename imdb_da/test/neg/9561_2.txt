Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate" but close. Try as he could, Warren Beatty just couldn't be believed as Bugsy. When he turned out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it rather embarrassing because it was so false. The other actors are not doing well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe signs. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have done better if the manuscript had him as a more credible George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel was unharmed, but then again this guy can make these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with only one line, steals one of the great Beatty, Bening scenes. With these movies, I'm never sure if the director intends to make mobsters act like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way. Whatever I don't like. These guys were murderers and no matter how much Las Vegas is due to Bugsy Siegel, I don't think a movie should be made to glorify the guy, especially one with a large studio background.
