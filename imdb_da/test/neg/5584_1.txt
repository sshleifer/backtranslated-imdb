The positive reviews on this site are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateurish in direction, action, in fact in every aspect. If IMDb is to give filmmakers the opportunity to dictate what is written about their film, then this is a very sad thing. This film has a negotiable premise, but it is terribly made. <br /> <br /> Movies are subjective so everyone has their own opinion. But this movie is on par with Ed Wood's work, but without any charm. Thinking otherwise shows poor taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I don't know anyone associated with the movie. I'm just a movie lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate, and so I felt the need to take the balance up and give a more accurate picture of the movie. It is very poorly made and the direction is under straight film making at the numbers. The action is the worse that has ever been required to film. The best thing about this movie is the poster and the DVD cover text. Besides that, it's not worth it.
