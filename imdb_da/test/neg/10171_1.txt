Like many of the comments about me, even though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it quite patronizing and actually preaching. <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, which I will explain in a moment). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie represents more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing side by side, the middle one a typical speech. In the worst case, the other party is represented by a person. <br /> <br /> Also, the interviews that the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, it is sometimes the discussion between the journalists (I mean, from an interview point, 'akward'). In addition, the interviewees are always calm, they say everything without normal feelings. Ie You cannot tell if they are lying or not, are angry or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is also very unprofessional, Christian journalists always believe in everything they are told by the people they interview. </> <br /> All conversations include: <br /> <br /> facts <br /> <br /> - Pro / con arguments <br /> <br /> There are no lies. No one is lying. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you're still planning to watch the movie) The only lie that happens is to demonstrate how "bad" non-believers are. <br /> <br /> This makes me the conclusion that the movie is a B movie. It is very similar to "Plan 9 from the outer space" (from the 50s), but this film also has an annoying, misplaced discussion about foreigners and Christian faith. NOTE: I do not intend to offend Christians, people who believe in foreigners or who are otherwise. This is a thought I have about the movie, not about people. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like to note that I do not know if the actors are bad or just got horrible scripts.
