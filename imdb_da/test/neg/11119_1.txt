I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not credible, just like the ridiculous circumstances they find themselves in. The only part of the movie I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters were finally killed. The special effects consist mainly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. It is hard to believe it is impossible to believe that a inclined creature sneaking up on goats in the middle of the night could be caught by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots. It is equally impossible to believe how they knew they should find it, despite the fact that the creature has avoided catching or even photographing. The man pulling the impossible to catch Chupacabra alive is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing that Dr. Pena is more obsessed with than the creature, is his dart gun. A dart gun that works was only the balls failed. The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is introduced as a "war veteran". He uses his military skill by getting his men to shoot at the creature wherever they are on the ship. Navy Seals emerging from nowhere repeats the pattern of shooting at everything. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance researcher brought aboard the cruise ship to catch a thief. He uses most of the movie tagging along with who is trying to kill the creature at the moment. <br /> <br /> The creature doesn't even look like a Chupacabra. It also does not behave like one. Instead of a small, shy, secretive animal hunting in the shade at night, we get a shot-tight Freddy Kruger that kills everything in sight. A simple search on Google would have been very useful for the authors and special effects crew.
