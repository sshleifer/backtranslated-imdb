Sure, this girl in Eastern Europe is full of sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Nicholas Cage's girl "8mm" An ambassador's daughter and her fiancÃ© mix it with a local woman in a triangle who ends up being lost. The tape is used for extortion and the stakes are getting higher and higher as the couple tries to prepare it themselves instead of going to the authorities. Sex comes and goes - and would be the only reason to rent it, I assume, if you like this sorta thing - and are completely free to the middle when we cross along the porn scene looking for the "other woman". I'm definitely in doubt as to how it got into Blockbuster, even with a youth-limited sticker considering how just a tip over the edge of soft core is. (Oh, that's right, it's the double standard. Actual art house flicks like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" get castrated R versions, but Straight To DVD crap as such gets the UNRATED banner proud. /> The action is horrible, the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal, but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a successor to 8mm. I would give flick a D for a class and be nice, but considering that they tried to fool me, it will be F, honestly deserves it.
