I saw this movie a few months ago when it first appeared on the shelves of Blockbuster. It's officially the only movie I've wanted to regret watching. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" one of the best comedies ever. I would also like to note that I am a writer and that I have met the director / author of this biographical marvel. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the play: If I were to choose a bright spot I would have to point out that Dion Day had an admirably functioning debut with its role in this. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer not an actor, so we will forgive him the order of his lame death. Why doesn't he fire the shotgun, he'll hold it once? Budget? Highlighting the bad act would take sides so I hold onto the selfish leader, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (which seems like a name chosen from a cartoon because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. His appearance is just fine, but his delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping on soap operations. I suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him, but part of the blame is definitely his. Special Effects: Not my specialty, but for a low budget flick I assume makeup and gun games were acceptable. It didn't disturb me, but it didn't impress either. <br /> <br /> Writing / Director: Oscar for Best Manuscript is not something I can predict Gerald Nott ever winning. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and stemmed. I understand stylized hokee ness, but it was just bad writing. What bothered me the most was theft. Nott stole scenes, shots and Viggo's facial hair from a lot of other movies. The scene where Russel Crow goes through the wheat field in Gladiator, Whole Sequences from Good, Evil and the ugly, that kind of thing just doesn't cheat with me. I choose not to comment on the shooting because I do not know what it takes to establish a good shot, etc. ... Conclusion: Do not rent this movie, not even pirate it. It's too bad to waste any time. The good reviews may be completely fake after meeting Gerry. He seems more than likely to send them himself.
