All this show is, is the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of going to school, he has to pass to become Emperor. He needs to learn something that he thinks is stupid; Eezma, who constitutes the protagonist, tries to transform Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> Films from the film have been copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko breaks the fourth wall constantly, squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
