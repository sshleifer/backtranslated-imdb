Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens tale is the biggest I have seen. Enough that I zapped away in his first commercial break. The characters did not appeal to me, and the animation looks good. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie a very low rating. Give me the Disney version anytime.
