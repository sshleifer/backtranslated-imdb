Honestly, I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hoping. Getting it led by Albert Pyun - one of the more well-known b-film auteur's - didn't even raise my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun flicks put it high? Yes, exactly ... but still the film announced a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> It's all going to push as the movie is so boring and moving so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the farther it went. It runs over 90 minutes, but it tells a story that could have been told for 30 minutes flat. I don't know what Pyun was going to here. I think the movie dribbles artistic style, but it's a veil at times, and maybe I'm an idiot to expect more from Pyun this time. Here he actually seemed to have a budget and a potential big throw for the material, but it is completely wasted. Crazy Six is ​​not much of an action movie, it's not much of a real thing. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing what is sad here is the fact that I found the final credit the most entertaining part of the movie. The music score is actually half decent with some smooth female vowels too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. Avoid.
