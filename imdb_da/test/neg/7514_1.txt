This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still trying to figure out how bad it was. Just because it has Godard's name attached to it, doesn't do well. Apart from the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see an insane long shot of a traffic jam that is not amazing, incredible or anything of that kind. While this long shot of the traffic profile is going on, you will feel more like making a pastrami sandwich than continuing to see it. Pieces of a supposed story, stupid, stupid characters. What message should we take from this? It gives nothing and serves no purpose. The director's arrogance in displaying these stupid, boring chain-smoking French people and getting them to sit and talk for hours and then get it done as art is truly amazing.
