A pretentious, but to varying degree, pay attention to the collection of mostly meaningless "stories". <br /> <br /> But let's start from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If you ever wondered what Finnish love / romance was like, maybe this tedious little oddity is a certain indication. Subdued emotions, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think the successor to this story will be "For our honeymoon, we move from Siberia to Greenland". Aki obviously had no idea what he was going to write for this little movie, so he just made a half-partisan non-"story" centered on a band he particularly likes (or maybe they are his friends) because we see them and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> First, I've never heard of this guy before ?? And now I know why. Nice black and white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless you're bored silly can be considered an asset. But you'd be surprised at how many film critics and film students love boredom in movies, so I highly recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze party to the two groups of humanoids. <br /> <br /> Herzog: Not a movie but probably a slice of its documentaries on tribes in South America. This is not a short film but a report, but considering how stupid the first two entrances were, Herzog's bit is almost refreshing and has some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious "time" concept very nicely. <Jarmusch: As it was almost expected, this once interesting filmmaker (with a peanut's brain, a talented idiot savant) serves us another drowsiness of meaninglessness. He has become lazy and cannot be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own films or a collection like TMO. The only bright side in seeing how a stupid veggie actor spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she's played by the lovely Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, this nonsense jumps over. Oh and btw: I don't think a young actress is listening to classical music; was Jarmusch trying to be surreal by making Chloe listen to that kind of music? Is Lindsey Lohan perhaps listening to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who should I say they are not? <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is a moron. Oh, right ... I've already mentioned it ... Wenders: Here's the actual shock of the whole movie: Wenders can actually do something good !!!!! Everything else I've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been boring and meaningless. But this short story is made in style (! Atypical) and is the best part of the movie. It leaves one who wants to see more of it, even if history has a decision. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord ?? What can I say here? Lee makes someone seem talented by comparison. Like Herzog, he does not choose a story, but sends a report ?? and a leftist political propaganda report on this! CNN, but in black and white and self-evident. Of course, "We Wuz Robbed", the retarded title of this little sleeping inducer, is about how the poor, gracious and infinitely idealistic democrats WUZ ROBBED of Bush and his EVIL EVIL team of THIEVES. This is by far the stupidest and stupidest entry in this movie, and I had to use the fast-forward button not to turn off. Spike Lee is really a product of Affirmative Action. God knows how many really talented (black) directors have never had the chance to make movies because this pretentious and untamed little scroll still gets the opportunity to make them. And he gets it wrong every time! Now it takes some talent, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> Kaige: The Chinese history has a solid premise. It's okay, nothing more. All in all, there are many and far better movies to spend your time on, but if your time is not as valuable (as it seems to be my own) you can check out this little movie. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes can certainly be an eternity in the hands of filmmasters. Time is valuable. Waste it on better movies." - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
