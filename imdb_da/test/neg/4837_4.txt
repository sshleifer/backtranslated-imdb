And also a wonderful start, a really quick start. It keeps you longing and waiting, is about to come. Unfortunately, the high adrenaline dries quickly, but certainly after half is over. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame because this movie has really good ideas and thoroughly explores many of them. But it is also one of its mistakes. By exploring too many things, it is mixed up in many things, so in the end you are too confused to follow some plot or character. It is very dark and moody, but it does not help much if it is also genre shopping just to try to look after something - and everything in its history!
