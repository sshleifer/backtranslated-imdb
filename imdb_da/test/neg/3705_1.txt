This movie is probably the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. In this, nothing happens at all in the whole movie. You can literally start the movie, take a short nap and then wake up with the knowledge that nothing interesting has happened while you sleep. And I've seen this movie three times, staying awake all the way through. I feel I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The movie goes as one might expect, according to a formula, without variation. Hunters catch baby bigfoot, are killed by parents, and the nearby town enters a bigfoot killing madness. This is surprisingly boring for a Troma release. <br /> <br /> So be as good as a service and skip this movie. To see it, you will understand why.
