The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the cinema, the cold, cold, wet day of the day. <br /> <br /> "The Cat in the Hat" was the name of the girl, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame and the kids didn't have to see this, humor wasn't pretty. <br /> <br /> The movie was like drinking milk from a ravko, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers didn't know how. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is terrible. The action was poor, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very raw. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their mother goes to work, she gets Mrs Kwan babysit. Perhaps the only fun part of the movie is when Mrs Kwan sees a Taiwanese courtroom, a `la C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to spiral out of control. The cat came to try to let the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, which suddenly begins to destroy the house. He improvises a television infomercial and scares the slope of the tail. And when the cat becomes full Carmen Miranda, it's not fun. Perhaps his only fun disguise is as a hippie activist. And there is a fish trying to warn the kids about the cat. <br /> <br /> By the way he warned us not, this movie was just as fun as sour milk or chopped off the tail. <br /> <br /> Soon, the children outside are looking for the family dog ​​that has the key to a box on the collar. If the box is not locked soon, their house will be home to the cat's universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> It's all about being terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of annoying Austin Powers humor to the cat and says things like "you filthy ho" and imagines herself as a woman for the rest of her life after a blow in the testicles while they are like a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as a troublesome Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is sweet as Sally, though they alone aren't enough to save this horrible Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter (accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin's smart and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, ever trying to vent the children's mother, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, mother's boss, and is also the fish's voice. The last three are also boring. <br /> <br /> All in all, if I was a parent, I wouldn't take my kids in potty humor because there is plenty of it and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. Like the late great Dr. Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you need to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore is already turning around in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says, "curiosity killed the cat." - The cat in the hat * out of *****
