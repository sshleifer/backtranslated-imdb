Good lord. <br /> <br /> I must say straight out of the bat, I only saw 20 minutes of this movie. Since I'm a hardcore Eraserhead fan, "what can't you see a hard black-and-white movie with little to no dialogue?" defense does not apply. I simply can't see LOVELY nice black and white movies with little to no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens when you give an anxious goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and the budget, and let him / her put as much pointless offensive display on the screen as possible. It was clear from the outset that this movie should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). Shots that should last a few seconds pull in minutes because the instructor has the sin "I just love love" and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire recording has been seen. From the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the body "God" (the film's opening movie! Joy!) I knew it was only a matter of time until I knocked off the tape. After at least 10 minutes of another corpse being pulled around, I drove on a rope at a gang of combed mystery men, I knew it was time to give up. I rarely give up on a movie. I sat through the whole Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows, though not happily. This didn't deserve the 20 minutes I gave it. <br /> <br /> If you are an Eraserhead fan, don't simply compare to that movie so you can rent this piece of amateur waste. Allow me to refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a wise and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white wonder.
