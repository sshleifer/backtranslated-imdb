This movie could have been great - but it wasn't. Among the cesspool of talented no-hopers and friends of the film producers who wanted to help out there, there are some mild inclusions of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has these scary Italian eyes. But he is with the worst denials of actors who have ever encountered. The movie's opening scenes are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porn. Fortunately, no one was missing. The rape scene mentioned is bad. The prison sequence was the best part of the movie - but irrelevant. The movie soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt to use cooledit and some sample CDs. It is boring, repetitive and extremely paralyzed. In fact, the whole movie is paralyzed. Go out while you still can!
