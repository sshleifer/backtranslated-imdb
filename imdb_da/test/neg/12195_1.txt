This was not a good movie !! Why are you telling people that? There is a nice little story going on and saw some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also what the hell ?! There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Fast as well It's not as if there was a long battle scene with lots of fighting. There were only three dudes from the bar killing these vampires as a fat man killing twinkies! The next thing you know is Clooney and the stupid girl rescued by Cheech, leaving the family less homeless in the middle of Mexico. That's the way it is. Literally. Oh and the strip club was an aztec temple that is fun because it should be southern Mexico not the border. Why do you suffer people and tell people it's a good movie? Don't rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. You will wish you had the time of your life back.
