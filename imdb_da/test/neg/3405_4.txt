I am very much into Waverly Hills and first seen Death Tunnel The Movie.Could not have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary came out and was thrilled to think that since it was a documentary, it would be more serious and not having the terrible special effects. Wrong the same guys made the documentary and destroyed it with effects instead of producing The raw way a documentary should be. Haverly Hills doesn't need help with goofy effects, it's fine, just as it is. Tours are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hours overnight survey per. Person minimal group of 10 for night study. Tours must be set in advance. Awesome place for Ghost Hunter!
