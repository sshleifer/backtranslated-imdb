... at least during its first half. If it had started with the three friends in the fleet and concentrated on the fleet's action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter movie. The other half of the movie is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close-ups of ships from the early 20th century, but it is like a dull toothache there. Also, don't watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it is a small one. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with showing three New York City friends working on the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for Sally (Ginger Rogers), a song candy salesgirl along the avenue. The First World War breaks out, the three friends seem completely indifferent to the battle, yet enjoy the fleet. One of the three with the smallest industry as a citizen (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) wins the commander of the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make the case more complex, Sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but has no way of telling him before the three victories in war. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because chemistry among the three friends is credible. However, at the age of 49, James Gleason looks a little long in the tooth to be a swamp, especially when the sign in the directory said you might be between 17 and 35 to be justified. <br /> <br /> A real obvious flaw in the movie that made me think that everything outside the fleet scenes was merged with tiniest care, is the costume design, or I should say the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just before WWI, we all dressed up in fashion in 1931 and all are running the cars from 1931 - nothing was done to bring this movie over. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you look at the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the umbilical suicide, you have seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.
