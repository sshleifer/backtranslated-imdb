Holy Sweet Murder This is probably the least fun movie I have ever seen. You can take my word for this as truth because it plays on television right now. It's really one of the most pathetic productions I've ever seen. There is not a single redeemable aspect of this flick. It only lacks some humor at all. The only good thing it may be for it is that it is so unfunny that it is completely unmemorable. In fact, I just sat through some ridiculous subplots, and I can't really tell you what was going on. The only reason I might remember seeing this movie is because it is so utterly humorous that it will stick to my mind forever based on it alone. An absolute must miss. If your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself the boredom.
