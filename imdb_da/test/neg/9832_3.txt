The Girl in Lovers Lane: 3 out of 10: Homoerotic subtitles in the movies are a well-known phenomenon. Lots of theses have come out of movie schools about the hidden subtitles in movies like Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane certainly fits the homoerotic tropics. In fact, it is so obvious and above the supreme self MST3K, which rarely notes such things in their riffing, it simply cannot avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. One a rich kid (Lowell Brown) runs away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts, the other is a professional Hobo (Brett Halsey). Hobo saves the child from a gang of thugs, and they end up in a small town consisting of a dining room, a pool hall and a whorehouse. Our driver scholar gets another look from the diner's waitress (Joyce Meadows as the titular Girl in Lovers Lane) who is clearly past the age to be optional and whose only other outlook is crooked Jack Elam makes a Steve Buscemi impression. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this seems like a strange movie to the MST3K treatment. While cast too old for the characters they play, the play is actually pretty good with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam giving solid performances. The story is small, but barely Robot vs. Aztec Mummy material and the production values ​​are cheap, but relatively competent. It's the strange Batman and his congregation gay undercurrents that make this movie both horrible and fun. Halsey is over the biggest objections to the children trying to be put in the whorehouse, hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at least get past the first base), and dozens of glances between him and the child; one hand on the shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing dates with the girl so that he and the child can shave each other. You don't have to be Freud to figure out this undercurrent.
