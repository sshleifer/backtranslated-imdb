Lance Henriksen was paid something to express this. I hope it was a lot. Former American champion champion, Kristie Phillips, starts as Charlie Case, a gymnast-turn-secret agent (because it is very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government pioneer ...) <br /> <br /> There is a truly hysterical opening scene where Charlie's uneven column routine is sabotaged by an East Block competitor. What follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes I have ever witnessed .... and they want you to take it seriously! Don't worry ... she's holding her down. <br /> <br /> Depending on it, it's just a messy boy of a spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes for the campy gymnastics issues, and then run for cover.
