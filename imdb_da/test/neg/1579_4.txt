I'm a big fan of The ABC Movies of the Week genre. I'm only 27, which means I wasn't even born before the series ended, but I'm trying to collect as many of them on DVD as possible. I have about a dozen or so. I had read such wonderful things about this movie, here and elsewhere that I was very excited to see it. I just received my DVD in the mail today and saw it anxiously. I admit that the first or two phone calls gave me the cribs - that boy's voice would give someone crawling! But it started to turn off quickly, and the whole divorce plot was stupid. I also figured out Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the movie ended. As soon as this story was told how Elizabeth Ashley's character had locked her mother, I knew something was fishy. Plus, no one ever thought about asking him why he happened to see that night when the fire occurred in the barn? I admit I thought he was coaching a boy at school to call. I didn't guess the dumb boy or the pre-recorded tapes (they ever said whose voice was actually? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> I'm only giving this movie a four out of ten because I actually liked most of the action in it. Ashley is especially amazing. It's a shame because this movie has such a good premise, but it does, sometimes it happens when you get his or her hopes for a movie too much.
