This movie was not the best ... but it had some good actors in it. Isiaiah Washington was quite good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous as landlord and surprising ... actor Tami Roman was good as the judge in the movie. I didn't even know it was her and I'm a hard-working Real World fan. She was completely trustworthy. Hopefully, this movie will not prevent the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah has left this movie far behind with the success of Grey's Anatomy, Ice-T with its permanent role in the NYPD Special Unit, and Tami Roman has been a recurring role on Sex Love and Secrets (UPN's new soap opera). I want the same for the other actors because a bad movie doesn't make a bad actor.
