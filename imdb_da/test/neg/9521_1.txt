I was very interested in watching this movie despite the article I read about the director of Tattler Magazine. I do not judge film by what the director may or may not have done. This debut feature was very hard to see. I found the split screen to be a distraction to the drama of the movie, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the movie is a copy of several other movies I've seen. There really was nothing new about this
