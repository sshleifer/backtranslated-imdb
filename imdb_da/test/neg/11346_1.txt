It's so bad I don't know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. It is a supreme Mary Sue character who has few things in common with the original from the book, which was (slightly) more credible. No, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable and immovable even beyond the standards set, that this "sword of swords" era, our media spins out too late. She is a 20-inch top model, thin as a fight, yet rich, already a leader in her field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper, and seems to have sufficient authority to, of course, defy anyone who are official as bad FBI agents. She is God. To balance it, she has to be socially awkward (because of her typically harsh upbringing that turned her into "Spock"), which gives us some happy moments where she wonders what is "Star Wars" or "American Idol" But, nevertheless, when it is very important, she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior to you. For the best, she is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> The more talented Boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir token for this construction, which acts as a bumbling comic relief and the house "Watson". In fact, everything in there is a popping of better works such as Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from which it attempts to mimic the sexual tension between protagonists. However, it is cheaper, as it is supplied with an elbow poke in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will undoubtedly buy into it, and thus the crazy rating this turkey gets. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, resulting in titling sex details from legion of sidekicks that aim to show it as bold and trendy, while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo-conservative Look at things. Historically, there is not much here to feast on, because crimes (always starting with some gruesome remnants) are solved by non-existent technology, while "squints", lovable but so wrong (women less than boys) go on varied theories everyone is in vain, as the protagonist has it all from the start, and when it is established she goes out and then hits the guy, typically a really hard hombre, with a spin kick here and one relax there. The end.
