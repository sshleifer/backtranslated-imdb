I just want to write more because it's required. But the summary I put at the top is too much for what this movie was. You know pretty much who is in it from the beginning. In spite of his attempts to plot twists that seem hard to look out of shock and horror when a twist happens, you never really have to wonder "whodunit" in this "mystery". <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad that I have to write so much to be able to comment, but rules are rules. I feel really bad about saying this, but it's the lowest I've ever judged a movie ... I think. It makes me wonder what I save votes of 1 and 2 for. However, I thought this movie deserved a 3 when I think there was some talent in the movie. Johanna Watts (or is it Watson) did a pretty good job. She cried and distracted in a lot, and I thought she conveyed that feeling well. The man who played the "drummer" sign also made it good for his short part. Many of the actors did an 'ok' job. But the main actor, David, forgets his last name (terrible with names) - was pretty bad. I think he must have thought he made dramatic screenshots for 'The Young and the Restless' or 'Days of Our Lives'. If you try, just picture him in a white lab coat, play a doctor with more personalities at the 'General Hospital'. It doesn't help that the film is even shot like a daytime tape. Although I'm pretty sure I could shoot the same movie with a camcorder; but without the obvious and soap'ish sound editing. <br /> <br /> The first time I ever thought the money for rent was this movie wasted. But I wouldn't see it again unless I was paid a large sum of money.
