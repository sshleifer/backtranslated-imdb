Let's first discuss the story. It is a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian flavor to it. A guy who is a love guru and another man who is apparently a sucker when it comes to ladies and how this apparent sucker becomes a charm by the love guru, is the story. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame guy. Now comes to the artist's performance, Salman Khan overtakes through the entire movie, he tries to be fun but fails great time. You can see Salman shouting the whole movie, no real play is seen in his performance. The Govinda couple opposite Katrina Kaif (Oh, my god, she's a girl hole. A real beauty) is really a 50-year-old guy, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the film, Govinda looks like grandfather of Katrina Kaif. What a shame! Comes to perform the movie. This movie feels like a B-movie and a bad imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is superficial and pointless, nowhere is there reason or clarity. Just forget about this movie because it's nothing but boring, typical Bollywood fare. In fact, I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.
