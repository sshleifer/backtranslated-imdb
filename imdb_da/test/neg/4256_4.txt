The year of production says it all. The film is a marauding root of politically correct left-wing feminist self-serving drive, of such a heavy-handed symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Each scene aims to shed light on one of the burning societal problems, mainly the role of women in working life, the role of women against men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Each scene is commented on by the inner dialogue of one of the most important actresses, or by making the scene a surreal joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot or who the protagonists actually were. This is the kind of movie where consumerism is mocked by making a couple love in a furniture bargaining window while the sales agent delivers his speech, or where a revealing interview of a scene's actress turns into a full blown striptease action for "of course" is the offensive gentlemen of the press equate to a raunchy club audience. Then we move fast as we are going to see war outbreaks in a peaceful forest, we must see that several inflammatory feminist public speeches are drowned in (he) blowing cars, horns or rebel forces, and of course we need to see cinema Stalin's news reader and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter. The film is an unparalleled piece of eye-catching for every (man) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasts leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drift ?? and also happy to see them so generously use their action skills in a movie I had never heard of before today. It is hard to believe how Bibi Andersson's face has the screen every time she looks. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw, which often swallows in an overloaded (?) Dimensionless whiteness, and you just never get tired of seeing the artists. How absurd that a film made with so much respect for the feminist agenda tirelessly advocates that women should not be considered just an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of amazingly beautiful babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could rewatch it tomorrow.
