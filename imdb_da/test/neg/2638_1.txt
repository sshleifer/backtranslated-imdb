This movie was so weak that it couldn't even bring good cliches to rip off. I love horror movies and want to see pretty much anything, but if I had to do it again, I would have skipped this completely. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I challenge someone to find something even far-reaching or interesting about this piece of waste. Not scary, not fun, not curious, it's not worth it.
