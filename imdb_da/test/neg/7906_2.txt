"Soul Plane" is a horrible attempt at comedies that only appeal to people with thick skulls, blood disorders and furry peas. The plot is not only incoherent but also non-existent. The action is mostly sub-paired with a gang of very moronic and terrible characters thrown into too bad a goal, and jokes are often seen and almost never even fun. This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have been old even in the 50s, the only thing really going for it is some beautiful ladies, but really, if you want, you can rent something from "Adult" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can hardly see anything here to recommend as you are likely to have a much better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof wallets or whatever. <br /> <br /> 2/10
