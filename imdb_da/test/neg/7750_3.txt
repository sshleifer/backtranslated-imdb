Even in her glasses wearing geek fashion, Kathy Ireland is very easy on her eyes, but her plays are not easy to see. Most of the film's actors either go above the top (in addition to "campy fun") or act a little embarrassed to be there. The effects and soundtrack are not a special and relatively low budget. The baseline really extends their ability to suspend disbelief. Catch this to laugh if it comes on a premium movie channel or network Saturday afternoon TV, but NOT the waist money on this thing. One worthy mention for trivia purposes is that one of the underground mobsters is played by Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing (and doing well) all Oompa Loompas in Burton's "Charlie and Chocolate Factory."
