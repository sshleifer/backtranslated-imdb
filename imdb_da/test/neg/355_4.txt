As a physicist talking about black holes and cosmology gets my heart running. However, I found this presentation too slow and not filled with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). If you have more than one passing curiosity in this kind of thing, go to the library and check out some books. You will find they explain the current scientific cosmologies with much more detail while filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does. Also to put the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the "greatest mind" or the world's "smartest person" as commonly claimed even among user reviews here on IMDb. Hawking himself commented that "It's bad. It's just media hype." They needed someone to fill out the role model for handicapped genius. In any case, I'm disabled. "To be fair, he is probably a genius, but among history's greatest scientists, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are easily considered even more. This is not disrespectful Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist but rather Not that disrespectful others who have done even more than he has, yet watch the movie if you really are in science, but if not, I think it would be boring for you.
