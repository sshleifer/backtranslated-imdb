If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time, try this one. I wasted enough time myself to watch it, so I won't waste any more and explain why it's so terrible. Be warned !!! Oh, I see I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or some people think it is fun to start making a low-budget movie about the underground underground monsters that will hopefully turn out to be a hit. The cavern is one of them. I didn't have high expectations for this, but the play is so bad, and the production is so bad that I seriously think about requesting a refund. Phewww ... a more line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
