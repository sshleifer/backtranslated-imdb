Inextricably starting in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) arguing as they run together in incline rain. Jim, unfortunately, collides with the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dying while Alice is turned into a wheelchair-bound vegetable. Devastated by his daughter's death, Jim begins to visit prostitutes, then kills them because of voices in the head. Erm, it really is. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin I hate invisibly as a movie. There are some movies you sometimes see that move the 'goal posts' as it was with everything you see then, some movies are so brilliant that everyone else will be judged by it, while others are as inedible, because example is so bad that it sets a new movie low. This really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen & I'm seriously surprised by the pretty positive comments on IMDb, although I'm not surprised at the low overall score on the main page, I'm not sure if I Missed something, but to a start Undeniably has no plot, it has no history and much seems to be almost random. There was nothing invisible to maintain my interest or entertain and consequently became a test of endurance to get through to the end. The film is trying to be shocking with some light scenes of sexual abuse of a funeral by a priest, a scene where a disabled person craps himself, it splatters on the floor and her risky male nurse begins to feel his dirty genitals, legs & underwear . If anyone can find such screams entertaining, then I just cut my wrists now, the sign is some of the worst I have had the accident knowing, the dialogue is hilarious with some it sounded like it came from some dirty bassoon porn of it worst kind. It does not seem like a horror as it is not scary at least, it is absolutely fun and honestly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a major loss and trying to cope and generally I think just It is a meaningless, bad, badly made crap from Troma. <br /> <br /> Director Ferrin film as something badly made documentary, special effects are horrible and are of 'let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor face & audience will be convinced that they died a gory death assortment that is no graphic violence except suicide, where someone breaks a knife in their own mouth. Given the amount of prostitutes in indescribable nudity levels kept to an absolute minimum ... apparently inedible had a budget of about $ 20,000 and all I can say is where did all the money go? Oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if you start recording sound, make sure you don't have your actor deliver their lines next to a highway that half of Los Angeles looks like Run up ... Actor sugar, period. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, total crap is. It's probably not the worst I've ever seen, but it's just down and I can't remember seeing such a horrible movie recently. One to avoid unless your a masochist or insomniac.
