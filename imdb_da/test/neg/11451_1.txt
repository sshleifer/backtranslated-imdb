*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much that can be said about this early talkie era flick. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" a "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But what can you say about it ... talking primarily to it. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, excessive use of portraying Indians as bad folk. In a scene, the little boy plays in the girl's main character - an indulgent and over-ambitious family who wants to create a newspaper business - just outside his father's office. An Indian cuddles down in front of the child. "Hi," says the boy to the Indian in a very polite manner. The Indian gives him a feather, stands up and goes away. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. running in the office. "Mommy! Mommy!" He shouts and holds India's gift back. "See what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times should I tell you!" she snaps at the boy. "You're never ever talking to the dirty Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) comes across as a man talking to a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a certain plan to give the family a better life. But we soon find out that he is not great at aching - far less a very good moral man. His slave child, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a telling sign of this. <br /> <br /> On his family's first trip to a Sunday morning church service - one <br /> <br /> where, curiously, Cravat is giving the sermon - Isaiah is trying to get together, dressed as Cravat , long-necked suit, holster, gun and everything. Cravat tells him to go home. "Yes, everyone doesn't want me with your church?" Isaiah says with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat straightens him and pats him on the shoulder. "You don't understand! I want you to be the guardian of the house. And if anyone ever comes ... you shoot him dead!" The people - not to mention the actors - in "Cimarron" couldn't <br /> <br /> appear out of burlap bags, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too praiseworthy. (Granted: the incomparable Edna May Oliver - notorious for playing the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, also released in 1931 - actually looks good, pulling out her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which is what she also has been best Yknown Yates is not popular in the city from the first week he arrives, <br /> <br /> and one of those crimes decides to shoot Cravat's white hat off when he and his wife (Irene Dunne In spite of his anger with the man who fired the ball, Cravat takes it all the way. <br /> <br /> Not only was this story "shot for realism", but it was a lot <br> /> <br /> deficiencies in several key areas: For example, Cravat's newspaper is never really seen. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but not any newspaper.) <br /> Perhaps the strangest thing is of everyone, though: located in a small town in Kansas, but for some reason Yancy Cravat is dead-covered to call his paper "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam." <br /> <br /> Really good westerns have always been very few and far between - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" from the late 60s to the early 70s. Cliche westerns, on the other hand, are a dime-a-box. <br /> <br /> If you like cliche westerns, "Cimarron" will make you proud - but as for me ... it made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
