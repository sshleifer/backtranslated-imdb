Ugh. Absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets top billing, but her character doesn't have a big role. Who is her character supposed to be anyway, the little boy's aunt? Another user commented on her being naked in a shower. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Maybe there are some alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, Quigley has a greater role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears briefly in a monkish dress that recites a vague dialogue. There are no other signs on the scene with him, even though he is kind of composed, otherwise there is undoubtedly over another's shots shots. There is also a really bad picture of him in a cameo cover (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of him in a family Bible. He originally rebelled Jack-O or so. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell shows cards on a television as a television horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the film he shows "The Coven", where she runs around a cemetery in a cloak. It is obvious that there are several of the Brinke recordings as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD dual function Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood. Jack-O: What is it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story of a pumpkin-headed demon gun, and he and some other children are afraid of a woman whom they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help her family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel the eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin head killer appears several times to hold the branches while looking at people, or holding his shoot in front of the camera and standing with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around with things and actually kill people. There are also some flashbacks for a western or prairie family where the little boy plays the little boy in that family too: Ancestors of his, I believe. I think they're counting on Jack-Os's backgrounds, but I'm not sure how. The little boy is apparently the protagonist, but we don't really learn anything about him, except he wears glasses, has nightmares, and will fight bullies even if he gets stuck in the process. More time should have been used to establish its character. I couldn't have looked less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
