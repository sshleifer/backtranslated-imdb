I had never heard of this movie before I caught it on telly last night. I hope it was never given a cinema release, as it would be an insult to the silver screen and film users. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be serious, should it be fun? Why the outrageous basic plot? Does anyone really care? ... Horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
