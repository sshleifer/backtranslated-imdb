Director Kinji Fukasaku may be best known in his homeland for his Japanese gangster movie, a series where this film shares a number of features. Violence and political intrigues are themes in both Shogun's samurai and battles without honesty and humanity, and both have a protagonist who finds his loyalty challenged by fraud. Both films also have a large number of signs that seem to have little purpose, but to die, and since so little has been done to develop them, their deaths have some significance when they arrive. This movie also has other errors. Makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were also substandard, inferior to other samurai films of previous years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chiba the character of Shogun's Samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman who ... What a guy; he even gets to wear an eyelid. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you might be disappointed; his appearance is a little more than a cameo, and just as it seems his character can do something interesting, he disappears for good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film's strengths are history that is infinitely more comprehensible than the gangster movies, and the challenges associated with traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging for their newly deceased father's throne, which may have been helping out. Early on, we seem to be faced with a few signs that could no longer be good and evil. After all, the older brother originates and has a birthmark, a scary sign of a villain. In the end, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-take-all battle for power there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
