<br /> <br /> I still can't believe Louis Gossett Jr. agreed to appear in this movie. Everything about this feature feels artificial, forced and constructed. The air sequences are flat. Enemy characters seem like puppets. This is just a bad excuse for a movie. At least Top Gun had air sequences that looked good (the external shots anyway). The queen's songs are cool though. Rent Midway instead.
