How could they take such a beautiful animated gem as Don Bluth's all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charming, cheesy, uninspired sequel. The scary music and lovely characters are gone, now replaced with sticky animation and an imaginative plot. Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun as Charlie, but he lacks the charming hard-hitting attitude that brought him to Burt Reynold's life. I especially enjoyed the songs "I will always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here". Disadvantages: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. In the beginning, Charlie is chums with Carface, but wait a moment. Isn't it the same character that was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess all the changes in the sky, but why isn't it called Anne-Marie herself? If Itchy make it to heaven, wouldn't Flo and Killer do it too? What's with Annabelle whippet's voice? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. The new characters are not that big (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoon-like "humor" is flat and unfunny and the "heart" just doesn't work when compared to the original, which had such a moving uninhibited touch that makes me cry every time. All dogs go to heaven is one of my all-time favorite movies. How Don Bluth is allowed to do this successor is over me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all followers go to heaven.
