If I didn't know anything better, I would have thought that the resurrection was made in the late 80s / early 90s when crap was sold as a movie in Hollywood. I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he is reading out of cue cards and becomes a fountain when he is going to emote. He was easily the film's weakest aspect. The other actors were ok, nothing terrible. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see where the bulk of the budget went: the special effects. The killings look quite professional, but are hardly up to the movie's lethargy. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't go so far as to say that the Resurrection is a carbon copy of the Se7, but it certainly has some similarity to it. Centering on a religious memory kills a modern crusade, the detectives investigating their work rely on biblical passages and Christian history to merge the killer's puzzles. However, the resurrection is deprived of the Se7's clever storytelling, filmography, acting ... Well, all that does well. Instead, the resurrection is for the public and uses the Scooby Doo method in mystery to surprise it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the resurrection was as bad as I expected it to be. I almost feel bad about criticizing this movie when I knew it would be bad to go in, but ... sue me.
