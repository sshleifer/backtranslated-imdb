This movie was so horrible ... I want to hell out of who ever made this movie ... I was an original fan of all the ghoulies movies ... but when I saw this, I just started crying I could don't handle it. There's not even ghoulies in it ... like the original creative monsters ... it's so cheap cheap ... I mean you come on a witch ... it's a niggle, no one want to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie is about ... "GHOULIES" I mean you got it right or what? That's y we looked at the others. Now we actually have to put up with this horrible story ... This makes me eat my own poop after Spaghetti Monday !!!
