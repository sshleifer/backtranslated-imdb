Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me interested in the people in them. I couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. This was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano level). Things know it is missing so many things. There were signs that could have been fun, but they weren't. There were signs that you could have wanted, but you didn't. Eg. The guy who thought the Beatles cracked his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they beat him. Haha. And the previous poster talked about 'I'm the Walrus' scene as it was special. What? He played 'I'm the Walrus on an old piano and singing out of tune. Is there an inside joke there? It certainly stuck to face value. This movie has a feel for a movie that people say they like because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" to say you like the fact that you get the whole metaphysical art / waste message the artist expresses. If you want to be entertained, stay away.
