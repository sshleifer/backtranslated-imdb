This is the worst movie I've ever seen and believe in me, I have many bad movies lately. I love cheeesy horror, but it was just awful. There wasn't a scene in this movie where I felt scared. All actors must have been people they found at the bus stop 20 minutes before shooting. I wish Blockbutser would have given me my 99 cents back. The action was horrible. The script was incredibly poor. Someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know it was terrible. I would be embarrassed to get my name associated with this monstrosity. Don't rent this movie. If you do, do not return it so no other poor souls will always make the mistake of renting it.
