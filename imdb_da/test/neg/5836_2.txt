Horrible movie. Just awful. The beginning of this movie is like something out of a bad woman in prison film. Then it continues to be a B-movie version of Aliens. B-movie in this case means adding free sex scenes and women in underwear. Oh, and a lot of the pictures are exactly the same as used in two other films by the same company (including women in prison schtick). The only thing that saves this movie from a 1/10 is that I've actually seen worse movies. Not many, and not much, but worse.
