Oh man! This series should be the worst possible anime I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and cold. <br /> <br /> Then it just got more and more downhill as the series progressed ... and I'll tell you why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) Okay, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early by reviving his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is drippy, sappy and a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> They are introducing a perver named Miroku, who was supposed to be a kind of religious figure to the show. (Who really bugged me because it was out of place and stupid.) Then they introduce a demon-slayer named Sango, whose sole purpose in life is to (and fail) to save his brainwashed brother. <br /> The big bad thing about the show, Naraku, as he started out as a really good guy, lost his touch after a while. (He became quite old, quite fast. And it bothered me that he was the only stupid in the show that did anything.) The people were all wood and unemotional. And then the end of this horrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku was never killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha were never completely in love (for he was still in love with his 50-year-old dead chick.) Plot holes were open. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing was changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged it out to over 150 episodes, and nothing was changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be happy ?? I was disillusioned, disgusted and annoyed as a crap. At least I had great hopes that there would be a good ending to the series. Instead, everything I got was out commercially for manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about swords and things like that, I highly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". That show is progressing and going somewhere, plus it also has a good animation. <br /> <br /> But be far away from this intense excuse for anime as best you can.
