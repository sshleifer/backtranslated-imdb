It's easy to tell early in this movie what will happen and who will die. It's about 4 women and a man on vacation. This was made at the end of ultra Nazi seventies, where blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserved of death. <br /> <br /> This film, like the others in that era, strives to bring this about and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or excitement. People gossip, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of time, it's ridiculous. The five people happen on two tough young characters and go nuts. All are nuts, so the director-author team can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go over nuts. One should remember that films in the 1970s were meant to appeal to women and not to men. Quite boring and totally depressing.
