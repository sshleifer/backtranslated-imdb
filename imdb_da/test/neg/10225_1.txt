Take a clich√© story and insert Steve Guttenberg. Can I say more? This is really as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to transform a group of useless, inappropriate children into a winning football team. It is absolutely struggle to maintain any interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenberg's plays, I can say with certainty that the rival teams coach is actually worse than Guttenberg. Previously, I had thought. This type of story of underdogs fighting all the way to the top has been done before and better each time than this so-called 'movie'
