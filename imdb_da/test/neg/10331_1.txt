It's only remarkable as the acting debut for the future big-time Hollywood starlet Sandra Bullock. This ridiculous action girl is so full of holes that you can easily lose termite attacks. The story is incomprehensible and very badly thought. The production values ​​stink cheese. In fact, an overall lack of production values ​​would have been better ... at least, the film might have been grinning that way. The ADR is ridiculously bad and all-embracing in the movie. It is debatable whether any of the actual slots from the actual shoot were used. <br /> <br /> The performances are mostly horrible, though there are a few exceptions. However, in these exceptions, the notions are undermined by the fact that the director apparently gave the players little direction and made them act out of character at times. (ie, signs that go from passive to panic in the blink of an eye. Bad direction.) Also, the constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines that are loaded, sliding in cocked, etc.) are completely overused, and more often than not, completely out of synchronization with the screen actions. Add to this cheesy "Bad Guy" vocal distortion for the premier villain (mainly so you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess on a movie) and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situation in the film goes far beyond the standard "suspension of disbelief" and even becomes ridiculous. A lead character uses a large portion of the film tied to a chair before deciding to use the butterfly knife in its sock to release it. So my questions are ... why didn't he do it before and why he even has the butterfly knife. He was not sought? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations that somehow have crashed into this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably poor R-rated TV movie from the 80s. If not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, it would never have found its way to DVD. But it has, so my only advice is to clarify. Seeing this movie can actually detract from your IQ.
