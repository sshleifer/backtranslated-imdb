I don't expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It should be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I actually laughed, and I think it's pretty bad. There is also no real plot, I have always had the feeling that most scenes could have been placed anywhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst was Kim Franke's "acting". He has one facial expression throughout the film, as if he were playing some retarded guy, but I don't think that's the case. All in all, I rate it four out of ten, I've seen worse movies than this, but I wouldn't spend money on this again.
