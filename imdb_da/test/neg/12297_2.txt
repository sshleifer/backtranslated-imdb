Dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in the relationship between Lewis and Hurt (why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway? The suspension is ridiculous. Lewis is very good but a script is needed and there is not 1. My score for this trash: 2 out of 10.
