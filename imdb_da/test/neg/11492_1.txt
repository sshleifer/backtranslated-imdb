The movie is a complete disaster. I don't know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I would definitely love to meet one of them and talk a little with him. Maybe scriptwriters really don't know about the situation in foreign countries in the present or recent times? or they just do nothing wrong and write everything they think is interesting. <br /> <br /> A great and eternal formula with crazy dictator + 1 lone hero (an American course) may seem like a good idea, but come on? We had such a tyrant in Serbia (Milosevic) that did many bad things for that people, but I simply can't imagine he shouting "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion as in the Middle Ages. Maybe they would show how bad he was, but it was a stupid idea. much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood as the right monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of customs is too long, but the funniest thing is: No matter how many national television stations there are in Russia, Russian President watch American SNN (CNN) news ?? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Burn this piece of rubish! <br /> <br /> AWFUL!
