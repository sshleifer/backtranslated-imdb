Forget about anxiety-ridden documentary! This movie is really an out and about comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the movie cuts off when he seems ready to jump into the song. But Ford and just as fast-paced girlfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even more fun is the "manager" Kyle who seems to have I.Q. of a beak and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stuck him. How can adult men be so self-propelled? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers do not seem to have any POV, and the film is poorly structured and very uneven. Very little background information is given on the three managers. Such an integration could have made the three look like something other than worsening West Hollywood stereotypes.
