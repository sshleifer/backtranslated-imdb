After watching the movie, I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This takes my worst movie prize away from Komodo, which is not easy to feat. It is neither a porn or a legitimate movie, and it gives them both a bad name. The action, the camera, the plot, the script and the sound are all terrible. My personal favorite part of the movie is someone who asks the bartender if he has grapes. Why was a joke like this put in the movie? Was the director thinking; "I need a humorous scene to balance the great actress so I will use some lama ass joke I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper." Another retarded part is when Norman wastes the invisibility pot on himself as he tries to prevent it from wasting. Why did they even disturb the film with an NC-17 rating if they hoped to get as large an audience as possible? At least if it was classified X it would be more sexual and therefore take viewers away from the overall low quality. I ask for someone who has worked on this threat of a flick of a flick to respond.
