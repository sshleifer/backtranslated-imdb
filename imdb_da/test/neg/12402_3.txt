I have read other hacks reviews of this movie and although it certainly is not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it is not that bad if you accept it for what it is - budget, b- movie ticket price, which we must say "borrow heavily" from similar "Alien" (unpleasant outer monster who cooks his victims) "Species" (beautiful and confused "obscure") and "Incubus" beastie-breeding-with-captive girls angle). This is a seriously cheesy movie, and it all was obviously done on a shoestring budget, although the alien is not too bad (I've seen far less convincing men in rubber suits at least). None of the play is Oscar material, and the Isle of Man doesn't really mean double for the Boston Massacre's very convincing. The reason is pretty predictable and the premise that a foreign craft would raise the bumps of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of a university university's campus - thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is absolutely ridiculous. However, the film has its exciting moments, there are a couple of nudity and half helper, and the film has one of the few movie appearances of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as "Space Girl") who, at an age of only 24, was killed in London by his black girlfriend shortly after making this movie.
