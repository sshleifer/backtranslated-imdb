Man, these movies sucked. It seemed to have seven different plots at once, and they all made little sense. The special effects, costumes and all things were beyond terrible. The action was extremely poor. Everything seemed so forced, especially the lines from the woman with the big eyes and the toddler (his "Noooooo" as he is buried is so unenthusiastic, it's ridiculous). A good part of this movie is still fun. The one woman's death, pushing a knife into a toaster, being electrocuted and becoming magical to the craziest skeletal dummy in the world, had my friends and I laughing for about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you're into really horrible movies, look for one. If not, run for your life.
