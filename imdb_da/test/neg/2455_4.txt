From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre made a number of very successful Mr. Moto films. While technical B-films were made much better than typical films by the genre. However, Lorre was tired of making these very repetitive films and telling friends he wanted out of the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled, but his plans to get more complicated and satisfying roles were not reflected when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOMED MEN is one of those films, and it is quite obvious that the studio does not put much effort into the movie as I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but still the film made some sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who agrees to be an undercover agent for the government. He must infiltrate an island in the United States, where something strange is wrong. Now they could easily have got a search warrant to do this. But when the penguins wrote the film, the agent raped for a murder he did not commit and spent a year in prison for this. He apparently hopes that he will be paroleed to this island, as many parolees are sent there when they are finished. <br /> <br /> There are some more serious issues with this idea. First, they only served him a year before he was paroleed - but he was convicted of MURDER and he refused to tell who he really was. They would never parole anyone in a case like this. Secondly, what if he wasn't paroleed to the island? He would have spent a whole year in prison for nothing! Third, why not just divers or paratroopers or police in both come to the island? Talk about a constructed plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with boys on parole as slave labor. What about the men reporting to their parole officers? This was never explained, but Lorre used them to remind them of diamonds and they were treated abominably. Now another question I had was that if Lorre discovered big diamonds there, he was a very wealthy man. So why not just pay people to remind them of the diamonds? Why create your own version of Devil's Island and savagely beat and kill the men? <br /> <br /> Finally, Lorre gets what is his and the island's slaves are released. Unfortunately I didn't care about it. Overall, but also stupid. Lorer's career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to Warner Brothers. With movies like ISLAND OF DOMED BUT I could see why his stay in Columbia was short.
