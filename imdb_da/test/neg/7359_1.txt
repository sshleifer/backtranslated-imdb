Horrendously acted and completely ridiculously haunted horror flick who has one out of place Anna Paquin plays a neurotic teenager fighting for the "things-there-bump-in-the-dark" that plagues her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in Spain (?!). A little more than a geographically replanted rip-off of "The Shining" and especially "The Other", the weakly plotted "Darkness" is basically your typical B-Horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by the audience. miles away (so to speak)! Gradually, I do not assume that I should not have set my personal expectations just as high for this film that it is actually good considering the well-known fact that it was celebrated for almost three years before finally being released around Christmas in Last year in American movie theaters across the country for what was ultimately lukewarm ticket sales and very hard reviews from critics. When will filmmakers ever learn that there are more to make movies (whether horror or otherwise) than just the flawed opportunity for a small financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
