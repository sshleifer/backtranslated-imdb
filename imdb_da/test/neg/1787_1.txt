This movie is so irreremably bad, nothing about it makes it worth seeing. No effects, no tension and poor dialogue poorly delivered. Oh, and neither a CAMP nor any FEAR contains it. Do yourself a favor and go to the original Friday the 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp, but what you ever do DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even Michele Bauer's appearance at the beginning can't save it. Usually, in these kind of movies you expect violence, excitement and a little gore and some T&A. The violence was badly executed, the "excitement" was ridiculous, there were no gore, and T & A was plentiful in the first 5 minutes, so nothing . At least one of these things, properly done, would at least have made it appear. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing about it, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands that they are doing schlock and rightly inhibiting it. If everyone else had watched that tone, it would have been campy fun, no sayings were calculated.
