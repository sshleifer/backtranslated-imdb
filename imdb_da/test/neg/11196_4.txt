The summary was promising, but seeing the movie was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The reason is linear and without surprise. Normal characters remain normal to the end of the movie, odd characters remain weird until the end of the movie. There is not even a single prelude to destroying the viewer to believe that the bad guy is other than the most obvious candidate. On the positive side, the actors play quite well and there is a little bit of atmosphere in the movie, but far too little to be significant. People who vote 10 for this movie either did not see it or are a member of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
