Of course, Danny Glover and Carey Elwes forgot how to act when making this movie, the play is horrible. The payout is even worse. I'm sorry Danny Glover, I hope he was paid well for this because it makes him look stupid, as does Mr Elwes. An absolute slap in the face of any horror movie fan. Despicable. This is probably the worst view of performing veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to look at the script or if they did, it must have said "forget everything you know about acting" because it makes the two of them ridiculous. For two experienced veterans to act this way is appalling, I hope the paycheck was very large, I thought at first it was a spoof. If you can find satisfaction in this movie then more power for you.
