This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The fate, the only bright place seems to be judging the female castmembers anatomical skill. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machines or run for at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium will be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes in your life. The reason is nothing original, the dialogue is disturbing, and even the weapons look like underpairs. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster and burn the copies they have of this horrid movie.
