While the new Pride & Prejudice movie is beautiful to watch and the soundtrack is great, we can't see Jane Austen's pride and prejudice. The film has for some reason been completed in the early 1790s, rather than the Regency period, where the novel is set, as scientists have long demonstrated. Bennets' Longbourn property is ram-shackled and resembles Cold Comfort Farm. The bennets in the short story are, however, gentry class; They own a farm, but the pig does not go through the house and there is also no manure farm and chicken animals near the home. Scenes are reset from the novel, and in order to not forget, Jane Austen placed scenes at certain places for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy suggestion scene outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, unlike inside the Collins priest's office: Why did Jane Austen put it in the vicarage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy talk to total whose brutal honesty to each other in this scene, Collinses has never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth crosses a windy field to stand on a rock and see the panorama, one expects her to cry, "Heathcliffe" in an instant! Austen has been bronteized! Judy Dench is a great actress, but Lady Catherine must be long and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: But Mr Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy, suggesting that his terrible dance with bad Lizzy is elephant. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; IP & P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe who never smiles - although Austen notes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she understands when she sees her wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley - a portrait there in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculpted marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue changes to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has become such a clown that you wonder why Darcy wanted him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it differs from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who looked at it and thought she could replace viewing for reading would fail!
