Certainly, the concept had already been made with Alf and the Charmings: printed modern society on one or more out-of-place characters. But I loved both shows and saw them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I learned about Scorch, I was actually hoping for something new, as new TV in the 90s had not impressed me so far (but at least Star Trek : TNG and the Simpsons still went. <br /> <br /> I got a big disappointment. The act was horrible, but given the ridiculous dialogue and absolutely amazing writing, I cannot blame them too much for what they should work with. There were a few humorous moments, but most of the conscious jokes seemed to be forced into their delivery. The whole production work on the show seemed too low for what was on TV at that time. In the 80's it would fit right in. <br /> <br /> Still, it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire performance of the series, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The second episode was not that bad and I started to get my hopes back when it got into its step, the show would improve. Unfortunately, my VCR did not end up to the third episode that was sent, I never saw it, and the series disappeared from the TV listings after that. All I have now is the first two episodes recorded out of the air on a VHS tape.
