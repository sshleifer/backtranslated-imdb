This is an indelible stupid, dull, imaginative, lazily composed piece of waste. When one sees a direct video slasher pick, it is only reasonable to expect the movie to become fuzzy at some level, but it goes far beyond trashy. It's just awful at all levels, with a clich√© ride script that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, a cast without names of actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even fans of slasher movies will not be able to find anything here that would make this movie a valuable one and a half hour's use. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a West Virginia Ferry Terminal that a member of the group recently inherited. Unfortunately for teens, the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices to help his crops grow or something stupid in these directions, and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everyone. I don't know anything about author director Paul Moore, but I assume he is over ten years old and therefore he should be able to come up with something more original than killed scarecrowers. Frankly speaking. <br /> <br /> The special effects that bring the scarecrows to life are ridiculously poor. They often look almost no more than haloween costumes on sticks. Special effects like these would have been considered rather poor 20 years ago, but according to today's standards, they are nothing short of embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether in horror movies. To watch a slasher movie, hire one of "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" movie. Most of them are not very good, but are certainly superior to crap like that.
