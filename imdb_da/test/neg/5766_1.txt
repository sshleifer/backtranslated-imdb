I'm shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people. They must either be fun or be completely blind to appear, control and other mistakes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I just couldn't force myself to pass through the whole movie, it was just too bad. The first three characters, not including the "poet" were just horrible actors, and I mean AWFUL! Maybe the instructor didn't care, or maybe he's a worse director. It was like seeing a bad school game. The film was, of course, filmed with a video camera (low budget - not really movie), and the lighting settings were not very good either. In addition, the sound (if they had one) should either have been a beginner or a full, since the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (AWFUL acting btw) the sound of the dialogue was rather poor. For example, when the woman moved her head while you were talking, you could hear her voice disappear and come back. It sounded like they had been trying to fix it in the post-production by turning up a bit when she turned her head. In addition, you had the ongoing annoying buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. All these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. Should I say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or fun project for friends to watch, but should never have been released to a real audience, especially not for a PAYMENT audience. THIS WAS RIP OFF, unless you have a very low standard in terms of film or just bad taste. You're warning! SB.
