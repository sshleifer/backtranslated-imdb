Another pretentious movie from Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" was shining the same, the quality was at least superior (mainly thanks to Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala's great achievements), but "Carmen" is boring and full of subjects (nice brunette with a dagger in stocking the bad man went to madness because of passion, Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros", ...) Of course, Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but about its talent there is more doubt, and Sbaraglia's role is so stupid that it results almost unbelievably . The scripture is weak, and Aranda's distinguished character affects the entire film. With these ingredients, the result cannot be good. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've seen, but a complete bug, in my opinion.
