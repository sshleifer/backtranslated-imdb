Tedium that only the French can do. I checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in, and with 143 minutes left I also considered going out. I won't even try to discuss the inconsistency of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be personable because I realized in about an hour that none of these issues were important. It was not just self-righteous or pretentious, it was a vacuum. A soul-absorbing vacuum. This movie has no saving grace, no enjoyable character, no fun and no sadness. It is not smart enough to be drama, and there is no moment in the least bit farcical. The most exciting thing about this movie is how it has managed to get the most glowing and positive reviews. I was fooled by these reviews, but you don't have to be careful reading. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.
