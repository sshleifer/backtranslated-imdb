'Leatherheads' are trying so hard. Trying to be light hearted. Trying to be a comedy. Trying to be a love affair. Let's see it's trying to be a 'His Girl Friday' at 'The Sting' using 'It Happened One Night' using a dozen sports films. Unfortunately, it doesn't try and the movie is as soggy as the last game field. <br /> <br /> A fan of movies would see the big battle scene in speakeasy between Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that the fighting that John Ford played with such style and enlistment and humor in movies as "The Quiet Man "or" Donovan's Reef "or" The Searchers "may have been easy to do, but of course that is not. I'd bet on George Clooney that channeling John Ford would be easy too. How hard it can be: masculinity run amok, stop, bottles broken over your head, an unstable piano player ... just put it up there on the screen with some happening music. Pardon. It takes a master to make battle scenes flow. <br /> <br /> Movies are not wanted for existence. Humor is difficult. Romance is difficult. Slapstick a lost art. <br /> <br /> I once read that you would never be too close to a ballet performance. Something about not having the amazing bubble of the show by hearing the dancers' feet or the grunts of desire. This movie is like that ... all the loads and good intentions, beautiful actors, fine sets, but it goes through its steps ahead of the gallops as the original galloping ghost, Red Grange, on which the movie is loosely based.
