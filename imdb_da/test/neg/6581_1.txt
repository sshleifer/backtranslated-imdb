I'm not typing: there's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits the head of a tunnel key and explodes (without any fireball) into a million pieces! It scared a child in front of me! ... In a G-rated movie! <br /> <br /> This movie can convince children that Santa Clause is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and mean! When Santa (here an anagram of Satan!) Appears, all 200,000 elves begin that "Santa Clause comes to town" as if it were a Druid war song. Then, in the reflection of this movie's "Rosebud" object (a jingle bell, whispering hints on why you can't hear the ring: "doubt .... doubt ...)), look old Saint Nick forward and resembles a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses from "K10C." When we hear him, his thunder voice sounds less like a jolly old elf, and more like James Earl Jones' voice is lowered about 20%. / br /> <br /> The syrupy music is out of place, dull and repetitive, it does not follow any emotional threads (as in "Titanic's" very effective score). That in order to create feelings of warmth and magic, it fails to touch, partly because it does not match the film's imagery. It just makes the whole movie sound like it was hurried in production! Finally, I intend to go with some other reviewers about how well ... "dead" everyone looks. It sometimes seems a little macabre. The Motion Capture technique is good at allowing Kings Island-like roller coaster sequences to look convincingly from a distance, but close to "real" actors should have been used. Overall, nice eye-candy to kill time in front of the TV, but not much else here.
