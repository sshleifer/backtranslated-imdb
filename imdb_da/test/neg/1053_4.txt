Most Lorne Michael movies seem to fail because they are essentially just extended versions of sketches that hardly make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a sign right from "SNL" - a great bold loving (in their opinion) goof who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the role of the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman. He's mated to the annoying obese Slob, and they endure miserable accidents as they travel land to rescue father's business. <br /> <br /> The reason is initially really defective. The whole premise - father door and rich silly son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to almost any movie you want. Like any SNL style movie, it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, just make a reason to watch a fat guy and a thin guy be "fun" together. The movie's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy class "Planes, Trains & Automobiles." The movie is great because the plot is not obsolete and reused. It's basic, yes - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving stuck with a slob. But that's right, dammit. It makes all the difference. The signs are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them and we don't care what is happening on the screen. "PTA" walked the cautious line between monstrous and utterly credible and relatable - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes as a simple deer in the headlights, becoming a clash that turns into a dead-deer battle that truly is not dead, so wakes and destroys their car. <br /> <br /> The whole broken car is stolen completely from "PTA" and it's scary how many things in this movie actually resembles Steve Martin / John Candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is simply too uncomfortable to find similar. I never enjoyed watching him in any movie and it hasn't changed me. Spade is given very little to do, which serves as the movie's most incredible character. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is wasted like the evil Baddie planning to destroy Daddy's Business. The end is a joke and not in a "have-have fun" way. More like a "oh god are they serious?!" manner. <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, it's cool. But I just can't get into it, nor do I appreciate all the things it "borrows" from - not just "PT & A" - without any credit.
