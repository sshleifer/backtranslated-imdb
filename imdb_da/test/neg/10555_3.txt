This is a frequently used line, but it really sums up this movie ... "If this is the current state of gay, then we are in real trouble". I watched this movie on SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6), and if ever there was a voice tag on IMDb, then this is the case. Just watch the number fall over the movie's release weeks. <br /> <br /> Easy plot ... Boy finds out that his high school ex (boyfriend) gets married to a female friend of theirs, so he goes back to his old hometown (still carrying one 10-year-old torch) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked the "Last Days", the director's last move, despite his cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances, but you have to become a better director with each subsequent release. I don't know how to get terribly supportive notions from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he succeeded. The script was Lifetime Network quality (way back since they were really bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortably hard to see. I continued to reach a non-existent remote control for fast forwarding, but in the end I got to the end and hoped for a decent finish. Uh ... no. Even the gratuitous male nudity that appeared during the movie was so incredibly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be fair ... they were 2 leaders, especially in the free naked scenes, beautiful. There was also a real sweetness between them during their revival friendship, as they uncovered how they went apart. And the movie looked good ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. How is network television capable of giving week-by-week fantastic, entertaining weekly episodes (like "Ugly Betty" "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many features of similar genre releases can be as bad as this?
