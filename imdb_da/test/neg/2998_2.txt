First, the light part: This movie is pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> That puts me in mind of "Magnolia". And then I thought "Wow - someone made a movie even more dumb and annoying than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I know nothing about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to be made by someone who learned much in the film school but knows nothing about storytelling. The trite plural elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic. Detailed comments will just be a laundry list of fiasco. elegant "parts are great coffee tables with mediocre music, the" emotional "parts are simplistic. The worst thing is that the movie shows no love for everyone for the characters, except a little cornball dignity in the pastor. <br /> <br /> still can't believe the respect some people have given this image.
