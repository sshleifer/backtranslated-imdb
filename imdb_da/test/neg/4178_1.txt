If you are looking for summer feel-good hit, Dark Harvest 2 can just be your ticket. The production value of this movie is extremely high (looks like it was filmed with a Sony Handicam and edited using iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound right out of a "Spooky Halloween Sounds" CD! Scarecrow from the cover, although he does not appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance, is frighteningly realistic! From the beginning to the end you will see that a man seeks search for his daughters through a saying, MAIZE! In the climaxing end of the movie you see ... you have to look at yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is not within 1,000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be a campy kind of "Troll 2" fun, but it is not. I cried after I watched this movie because I realized I had spent money on it (and I found the $ 4 I used to rent it). I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
