If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant will be the best way to send you to a 7-year-old coma. The movie is so overwhelmed and manageable that it's hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could overlook such blatant dullness. The story has a damned doctor (whom we will never see) move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can fight any infection (yes, like the episode of Futurama) . The vaccines do not work and the human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Do not want to be caught by the government in stitches, head the group into the desert to cover, hoping the sunshine will kill the virus. All this is told by Michael, the only quartet who is immune to the infection. And that's the most boring story ever. They could have thrown someone with an interesting voice, but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the editor insists on shading more than half of the movie and giving it a strange dream-like feeling and increasing the audience's desire to sleep. It's not surprising that half of the audience went out of this, I wasn't one of them for some reason. But I have to do well. <br /> <br /> The end must be shocking and clever and preventative. But it is clear and simply not. A relief yes, but not dramatically at least. The complete fairness of this production and subdued sound, which makes a lot of dialogue incomprehensible, fights what could have been an interesting sci-fi story if it had better actors, cooler locations and a sense of urgency. As it is, Radiant is a snooze test.
