No emotions. Bad music (and I'm a reformed 80s metal guy, so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in to see what horror from the eighties they will pull up next time. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the cause, but doesn't get enough time. Wahlberg is okay, and Aniston is slumbering. We know she didn't need the money. Is it the only role she could fit into her summer vacation? Surely she must leave her forehead every time it comes up on VH1 - which is just a little less than Ozzy does. It hardly qualifies as a television movie. It's just hard to believe that it was actually released on a theatrical basis.
