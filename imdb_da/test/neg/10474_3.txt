I rented this movie with courtesy of Netflix and thought I'd receive the 1972 version. I sat clueless, looking at this new version, thinking: Gee, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had a little 70's of sound to it. I was even more convinced that it was a 70's movie when it happened to me (almost every five seconds) that the only thing missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a loaded stare, one passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, although John Knowles himself stated that this was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, that was exactly what it was. When people (usually young) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that these longings for love, unity, desire to express themselves sexually, all waste. These boys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to. <br /> <br /> Despite an exciting performance by Toby Moore, I never felt any of the feelings were real. I have never been associated with any of the boys because their relationship was not honest. People would like to live in a fantasy and think about it because this occurred in the 1940s that these boys could not 'I have not had these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they did - at least in the book they did, and in this movie Finney had almost painful for Gene. The "intensity" that John Knowles suggests existed between them was a creation of homosexuality, a heroic worship, an idolatry - it would normally be expressed in a sexual manner. Although these boys suppressed it, it should have been crystal clear, but this movie is not even an idea of ​​it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney, who has broken her leg, is playing the leap of all the other boys under a ball game. Unless they were just a bunch of nincompos, they would know they couldn't throw their bodies at him. It was clear that this bone-breaking moment was lost on both the director and the producer.
