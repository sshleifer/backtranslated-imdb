I have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I've also always had so bad-it's good flicks you look at someone who actually liked the latest cheesy kid flicks like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I saw this and it turned out that all the critics are right about this. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike many flops it's not even fun at any level, not even just to have fun. It's just a boring ringing party after another all the way through. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I didn't hear. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Don't be foolish, don't waste time and money on this pile of trash can.
