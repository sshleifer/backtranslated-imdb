Okay, I just had to look at this one ... As a huge mental gimp, I've just been through this movie in its entirety. You will notice that the trivia section of IMDB points out that parts of the 747 acquisition were "borrowed" from the airport in 1977. This really does not scrape the surface ... Almost all exterior shots of the plane shine over the ocean, land in, sink and even that -rest shot is borrowed from Airport '77. All "raise" shots are drawn from '77, including most of the inner river clips, except for Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help wondering if Olivia Dehavilland might be floating at any time, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye roll: Dennis Weaver's name in this movie is Stevens, who has to compensate for the airport's 77 aircraft being owned by Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmie Stewart of course). <br /> <br /> This is a true calvalcade of actors who do not work much or at least have not worked for a while, which might have been the first clue that it would be a real stinker. <br /> <br /> I have rated this movie a 2 - It's probably a "1" but if this movie can't offer any other redeeming quality, at least someone has helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver makes their car payments that month!
