Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply didn't fit in his silent sign that made him rich and famous. His career was never restored when the sound came to film. Unlike most of the reviews I have read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by comedian Chaplin, and not use their entertainment dollars to see Chaplin's political commentary. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin's prizes and chivalry, I would take exception to his "contribution" to humanity. The great dictator was made at the same time Stalin's brutal dictatorship was showing demonstrations, and both dictators signed the agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both dictators. World War II started in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated for 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this movie was made and the investigations of Hollywood from the federal government. Had Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire, as well as including the Italian dictator, he might have been less criticized by politicians. Soviet abuse of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazis in time and in numbers. <br /> <br /> Judged as a movie, many of the gags were too current to be understood by younger viewers who would not know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. A classical work of art must be the time test. The classic Greek tragedy, Mona Lisa and Beethoven are 9. still enjoyed for centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Films that rely on current political comments or currently popular social views usually do not surpass the generation where they are made. But those who solve problems common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, instructor, and lead role, blame what I judge as a dated and tiring movie. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's apologists have apologized for their decision to leave the country, which made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the US so offensive, why didn't he come back to his home country. Great British hit the Nazi 'with blood and money. What contributed to Switzerland in the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and selects its members based on race and class, and cares a little about people who cannot join the club.
