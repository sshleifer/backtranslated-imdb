Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, a creepy sennate key who fluttered easy credit and cheap rocks on Sennat TV during the 1980s and early 90s. I only mention him because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks like he is playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and nearly uneven crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up with her actors after completing this movie), who controls the local syndicate. Our heroes (let's not call him Paul from the Diamond Center) play the restaurateur with all the subtleties of The Simpsons' Luigi ("you like spaghetti?") And seem unimpeded when one of his patrons complain about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce. There is a red Buddha in the pasta, the murderous crime chief's calling card, which sends a statuette to each of her potential victims. Dead machines are bad on any measure and rather boring, which is an even worse crime.
