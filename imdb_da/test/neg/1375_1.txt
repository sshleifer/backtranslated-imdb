Carlos wants to make fun of affirmative actions, racial stereotypes and related issues on his show, which makes him much like the Supreme Court's justice Thomas. He is there because of his race and then denigrates it. He may seem to be having fun with Mexicans at no end because he himself is Mexican and I would also argue that he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any play person can tell that he is not sharpest tool .... even though he's definitely a tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> He is a hacker who, even with a staff of writers, cannot put together 3 minutes of really fun material in a 30 minute show. I can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on TV, Carlos can hold a light except perhaps Larry the Cable Guy (not too surprisingly, he also has a show at Comedy Central to accommodate exactly the same audience without a doubt. <br /> <br /> If you ever see the big ones, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feel for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a fun Interestingly comic voice. All this work was completely skipped by Mencia, his comic voice is partly stolen from other better comics and partially hidden by his hang to shout his unfunny rehashed racist call The Mencia show is loved by some of the "at least I Don 't sigh the bad crowd I believe in, it seems to be better off its rants to dump into society. Unfortunately, Carlos and his fans are part of the problem, not the solution to that issue.
