Although he only made his debut film in Australia and went to Britain and then America to pursue his career, the Australians will tell you that the biggest movie star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Nevertheless, I attribute this film to the well-known Aussie irreverence to destroy their own reputation. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem telling Errol Flyn's life story was that he told enough high stories in his life right at the very end of his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that much of the movie was based on it and by reading between the lines of that book. <br /> <br /> His mother's infidelity to her father was not written, but could have been derived by reading My Wicked Evil Roads. He didn't particularly like the woman, it's clear from a few sources. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie had done more with its New Guinea adventure, it was for me the most interesting part of my evil evil ways. As for his street fighting in depression, I tend to disbelieve it. Although he had succeeded in doing so, I guessed that probably it would have ruined his appearance, and he would never have had a career as a leading man. <br /> <br /> Still the people downstairs seem to think about the atmosphere of Sydney during depression was caught well, and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American audiences know him best as the uptight, but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential, who came out the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
