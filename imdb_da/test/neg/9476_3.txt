Now I looked at this when I was hungover on a Sunday, and my aunt and uncle visited one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We got stuck on the TV and pass to Paris just started. My cousins ​​had both said they sometimes saw two songs, and I said they could watch the movie if they liked it. When I was unable to get up, I just got into the living room with them and ended up watching the movie! I have to say that as a person who has no interest in these kinds of TV shows or movies, I actually enjoyed it ... it must have been alcohol lol, but I admit it would probably only appeal to girls aged between 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or show you don't think you'll like, but for a laugh, you enjoyed it.
