Appropriately, this is the final film of the Left Behind series, which is the fundamentalist preacher and novelist Tim LaHaye's idea of ​​what to expect in our future in Planet Earth's last days. If so, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The fantastic four of the revelation are all left with a cast change, Arnold Pinnock, who would most like to be an adviser in life with derek, is now ministers instead of Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the antichrist pilot of the day and Christian at night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and ace investigative reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have spread the true character of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathy and again throwing sand into his machines. This time, those who ally the president of the United States, played by Louis Gossett, Jr. He has a hell of a hard time, especially the guerrilla launch on RPG attacks on a presidential motorcade killing Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, Toad is Vice-President. Someone really messed up badly here because everyone who includes those who would hurt them knows a president and vice president NEVER to travel together. <br /> <br /> It takes them the whole movie to convince Gossett exactly who Karpathy really is. Once again, the best in the movie is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We can still see yet another left back movie, the door was open, though people assure me that they have run out of Tim LeHaye source material. I assume as long as they make money, and these players can't get jobs in the regular movie industry. And there are some unsolved plot problems involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, who are Mrs Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the fantastic four dies in this movie, then it will be the amazing three or will they get another fourth. Stick around.
