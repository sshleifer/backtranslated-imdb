I was recommended this movie by one of my film-making friends, and therefore expected something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - ah, a movie about a wimp raising on their one ** hole boss, where original - and then the other half fast forward hoping to find something that would justify 45 and minutes I had already wasted. But all I got was that the shock ended ... The basic problem is that this is a movie that cannot decide what it will say and says what it says (hard to tell what is) bad. Great plays don't store a bad script full of characters I can't care about. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if I didn't make moonlight in the movie industry, I'd be shocked to discover the stupid policy and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it's my feelings as summarized above: 'Ho Hum'. <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if it wasn't for acting and paper cut scene.
