Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), Sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho-murderer dressed in an old rubber mask and a nightgown interrupts their party. <br /> <br /> They say you can't judge a book on the cover, but it looks like the same is not the case for DVDs. I was in the mood for a really bad horror movie last night, and since the embrace of the grandmother highlighted a sharply photographed picture of the titular killer, an ax, horrible style (they even use the system font Sand, a particular design no!) And credits with Absolutely no one I had heard of, I expected it would be pretty miserable. <br /> <br /> It was! <br /> <br /> When a movie enters a little over an hour long, it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action; Granny, however, uses the first 20 minutes with his unlikely friendship that offers meaningless games and extremely banal conversation. Anyone who actually stays with the movie that is long enough to kill to begin (and I doubt most sane people would disturb) will be dealt with on several terrible death scenes with amateurish doings, lots of horrible appearances and a surprise that comes as a surprise (if you have seen April Fool's Day, then you guess what the turn is way before it is revealed). Granny is uninspired, unexciting and almost unavailable. Avoid.
