Some people may tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows because it emphasizes character development and continuity and has a more complex background and plot. In some ways, this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show goes out completely. The series starts as a soap opera on a space station with two full seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots of the characters. The characters are a good bunch, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the authors were trying too hard to make them "normal". By "normal" they actually mean "plain and boring". At the end of season 2, we are introduced to Dominion, which hangs around threatening for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in season five. This is the biggest "arc of history" on the show, but it only takes a fraction of the entire series. We still get lame free-standing episodes, heroes are still stranded on weird planets for forty and five minutes, and there is a terrible mass of low brow comedies with the greedy, greasy Ferengi. Many episodes are only boring and some are unatchable. The Dominion, DS9's greatest villains, is bent on galactic dominance for the practical reason that they like someone. The whole war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressive pyrotechnic spaceships occur at high frequency from season three onwards, but these are performed in ridiculously simplified ways, such as two large fleets of super-sophisticated starships flying close to each other and spreading away. DS9's authors (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later "Battlestar Galactica" fame) spiced their monotonous show by starting a war, but in the heart it is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> The DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping, and the characters never really develop in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" fulfilled both promises from the DS9 and made everything much better. For Star Trek, stick to the original and the next generation.
