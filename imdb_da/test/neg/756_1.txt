Wow, what a racist, prophetic piece of celluloid waste, and what an insult to the great genre of Western. Exploitive? Gender scenes are abundant, violence abounds, violence and gore abounds ..... all that gives modern movies a good name, especially among those who prefer classic earrings. This is the kind of sleaze that gives the old people's ammunition against today's film. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I just can't see naked male bathing pictures in the Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey movie. I also can't see hearing "morph --- is!" exclaimed here and there. On the contrary, I doubt that the word was just about 100 years ago. Still, the f-word is so prevalent here, you think you saw a history centered in today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Why? Well, what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the unpleasant, brutal villain? Do you think anyone might complain about a racist movie? Home will we not hear a cry when, conversely - as seen in this movie - are hundreds of theaters displayed across the country? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently, he is "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee would not be this racist. You can't get much worse than this movie.
