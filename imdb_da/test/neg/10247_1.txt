This picture hit the screen of June 6, 1980, with Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring in this year's Playmate Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the infinite roaming space on the police side and I'm looking for criminals. There the ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. Sets Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to find out who the unknown ship belongs to. When they fail to call on Captain Comelius, who imposes his crew to fight back. Ends the beautiful Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, which is man-made robot. Now some thoughts on this picture. This movie was flat stupid, and that's one of the reasons I didn't get into Sci-Fi. If you are in Sci-Fi, you will have noticed that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie entitled Battlestar Galactica, which was broadcast in theaters in 1978. Many of the doors sound like you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie sent back in 1966 entitled Star Trek. Now that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her disposable clothes. I think her talents were wasted in this image and she should never have been involved in such waste. Connie Sellecca was also considered the role and her talents would also be wasted. In the picture alone, I give this movie 1 tissue star, and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 tissue stars even though she doesn't deserve to be put in a trash like this one.
