Good things out of the way first: <br /> <br /> Underdog's voting was FINE. But Jason Lee is amazing though, it's really no surprise. Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did fine for what was given to him. He acted the part shockingly well. And so did Patrick Warburton, the moronic assistant. Now it was idiotic, but he acted so extremely well, I actually liked the character better than the main characters. The lines to him were childish but witty. <br /> <br /> But. Alex Neuberger did terrible and hopes that he will never work again. His "Scream" was so disgusting false. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talking, a "oh no, impossible!" would have been sufficient instead of the pathetic false scream. <br /> <br /> Then there was the girl and her dog that chased Patrin's character Cad on the roof. First, it makes sense, she is a "Reporter". A school reporter, but still a questioning mind regardless. But why, why did HELL bring her dog around? It was worthless, and the damned dog didn't even say anything but a heartless "Oh, underdog!" Her presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinists, his help and the underdog's voice.
