If you like me, you will see this in a movie history class or something in your school, so try to convince your teacher to see something else. Believe me, everything is better than this movie. It is slow, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, should I continue? That's the message well, but I've seen them handled better in several other movies. The action is not even good. This movie is just even more awkward as it starts to be fun (not intensive though) because of it's surrealistic history than at the end it just becomes uncomfortable to see. I honestly feel 1 hour and 40 minutes in my life have been robbed. Why would anyone like to see a girl describe a triangle for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can get sheep to look, look at a rape, or see the female lead Eat her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. And if you're not happy with my preview, I'm seriously an open minded guy, and I like movies protesting through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. Make any excuse you can to avoid this movie.
