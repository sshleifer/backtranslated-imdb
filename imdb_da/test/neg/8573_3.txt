I thought this movie would be quite different from just another teen slasher. Well, I was completely wrong. There is a floating non that comes out of the toilet seat and something really strange. I know the Spanish culture is a little different and their movie too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. They mistakenly faked it quite well though. Why did they make a movie without new aspects? This is simply boring, and it had been done completely without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun as the bad guy in the movie would be something really original. It turned out to be a teenage slasher. If it had been done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but it certainly has some comedy values! It's like a scary parody on some points.
