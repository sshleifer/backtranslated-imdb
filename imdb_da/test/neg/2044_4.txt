The movie is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is Shalom Harlow's ridiculous performance. It has been 4 years since this film was released, and hopefully Harlow has been through more training. Perhaps she should adhere to the more secular, somewhat corrupt characters she has generated in other performances.
