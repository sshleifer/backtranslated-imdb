Say what you want about the cinema's "Wizard of Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be admitted that from his first movie (1963's sweet "Blood Feast" and 1964's cracker barrel massacre "Two Thousand Maniacs") to his last (1972's "The Gore") Gore Girls "), remained the man faithful to his mouse, and beautifully crouched up the body of the body and body to get the camera removed. For example, in "Gore Gore", they have changed pasty-faced and pasty-clad strippers at Tops & Bottoms Club, and unpleasant ex-detective Gentry is employed by a hotty cub reporter to help the case. The film has remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, horrible lighting, eerie action, conflicting characters, problematic sound and of course some of Lewis's patented outbreak scenes. Thus, one of the strips has pushed her face into boiling oil; one has her head skinned open; another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off; and yet another has her bum paddled with a meat lumber until her entire back is covered with what appears to be Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here, it might have been Ragu.) The movie also throws some paralyzing humor, though some of the lines are pretty funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the stripped Suzie Creampuff was ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made In Poland" on it (don't know why, but I thought it was fun). And some of strip club owner Henny Youngman's lines are of course entertaining. Yet it is not the movie that refers to Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It's one of the most sickest you will ever see, with just one surefire, audience-pleasing moment - the title card in the movie's conclusion, which reads, "We announce with pride: This movie is over"!
