When you read the commentary on this movie, it's smart and fun political comedy based on true events - the only true word here is that it's a comedy. If you are told it is insider movie about Russian politics - it is not. There is probably only 2% in the film from what really happened in Russia during this election campaign. In fact, in 1996, following the situation was a thousand times more interesting, and it was a really funky election campaign. Now there were PR advisors from the United States who worked in Yeltsin's staff, but their role was just minimal. The whole campaign was completely different from what is shown in the movie, it would be much more fun to show all the Presidential people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash, and the celebrities who give the idea of ​​supporting Yeltsin everywhere - At least that would be true. I give it only three because of the respect for Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I lived in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in Russia in the mid-90s and never saw a man with the gun on the street.
