I would say this is a background movie. Play the background as your tendency for busy work (laundry, check emails, etc.). I thought it was a movie made before Amy Adams was successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The play / script is pretty terrible. I love musicals, but the song is just average and doesn't move the plot together. Ughh. It almost looks like it's made for movie movies based on movies. Do I see a TV program? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary breaks out in the song. What f @ # $ is going on?! In fact, she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great in Enchanted. The lead actor is average. Disappointed for sure. This movie would have been good for life, but it's about it. :(
