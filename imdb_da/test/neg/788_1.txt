possibly one of (if not the) worst movie ever perceived, cast and acted in the history of the cinema. Who on God's green earth would ever think of throwing Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like her mother. God forgive me, but I'm just honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plagued this horrible excuse for a movie. It was a terrible statement against women, but at least if you were to blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loopholes and pathetic excuses for excitement and excitement. Everyone had to get the money back, which went to see it in theaters or bought the DVD.
