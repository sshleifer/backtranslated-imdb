A less than redemptive hunka junk who is mercifully free of competences. Some northern idiots come to the deep south and look for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by scary hillbillies, in a broad nod to 'Deliverance'; But it turns out that hicks are fronting for a northern marijuana trafficking badass. This has come to light so early that it does not even qualify as a twist. The women are unlocked and raped in catatony; Instead of saving them, the guys go down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them. I think if my girlfriend was raped, I would still take the shortest path to the hiding place. It's okay though, because as soon as they discover the evils, the girls all get cheery and jump around, if only trauma was in reality. Also with a backwoods guy with a beard who cackles a lot. Not exactly blasting stitches with ideas.
