Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track in World War II when Australian militias delayed and ultimately stopped a push of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move over land and capture Port Moresby. What they really think is that the movie is set for this time period, but is fiction, and everything that happens is just a wealth of standard images from other war movies. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some of the scenes are simply there to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrifying beyond comparison when there seems to be some evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. Both sides suffered from logistical shortcomings, and the terrain was a major smoothing in this conflict. As the Japanese got closer to Port Moresby, their supply line grew and eventually resulted in their downfall. On the other hand, as the Australians pulled closer to Port Moresby, their supply fell. Some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the standard scenes handbook to include in any war movie. The movie was misunderstood and highlighted the youth production team. At a time when Australia could have made a big movie about one of Australia's best moments, the movie Kokoda is a low disappointment.
