I was initially interested in this movie after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots, and the promise was for a gripping horror movie of the Dario Argento style. Admittedly, I have to say that Argento's film has in the meantime been rather incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visually influential sets of loosely tied together with a vague federal ball. When Argento is credited as author of this, I have to say I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria shows, when examined, the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes solely for the aesthetic effect. But Suspiria also had the benefits of a unique protagonist and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the final solution. The Church, on the other hand, has none of these things. It has no main character, no main character at all; It also has no real plot to talk about, and no crescendo, no climax, no degradation and no decision. It's a totally hollow, incoherent work that looks like Argento sat down and thought 'hi, it would make an interesting scene visually ... let's do it!' The movie is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Originally, it could be interesting, and Soavia's direction is excellent, I must say. Soavi cannot reject the material as it is made as compelling as possible. However, such a good direction calls attention to the terrible error of the script, and there is absolutely no meaning in it. Attempts on a central unifying plot are nothing but plagiarism of Carpenter's film Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script wants them, and responses to these events are absolutely incredible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged by a point, simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief; It's too ridiculous. Added to this are numerous flaws that so clearly show that it becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been more obviously artistic and edited in another work, it could have been chilling or tense. If it had been fleshly in a really coherent story, it could have been gripping. But none of these were. The best thing that succeeded was confusing and sometimes staggering. Lands are introduced, but never followed. Characters are forgotten and changed arbitrarily. No logic has ever been applied to any situation. It could have been frightening or interesting, but in order to evoke that kind of feeling, a greater effort is required from a writer ... much more. All in all, the church is not worth looking at any but total Italian scare enthusiasts who are more style than fabric. This is Argento's style at worst, and this is a strong reason for the usual criticism.
