Really a big leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad. Tools (if it can be called), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it's all terrible. There is no single element that is well done. If I thought this was intentional, I could give the film some credit, but I can't believe that people would set out to make such an audible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and screening for your worst enemies.
