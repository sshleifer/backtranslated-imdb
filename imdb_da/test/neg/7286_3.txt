Hey. I saw the first part when it came out, and I can't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one. First the animation is chopped, wood, not worked on, lacks naturalness - I understand the cartoon was to be of some 'atlantic' kind, but it could be done with the usual Disney finesse ... see "Tarzan" to see what I mean . If I couldn't see the DISNEY logo at first, I'd never say it was a Disney movie. Secondly, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old quest. Not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that ties the viewer to the characters and their goals. It was at least inconvenient. The film was intended for children, but it was sometimes childish. <br /> <br /> Third, the music ... I would say it was inappropriate, but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and the animation ... All in all, I think it was a kind of amusement, straight by the way kind of project by several apprentice animators, just to fill in the count of Disney movies. Sorry to hear from myself, a great Disney lover ...
