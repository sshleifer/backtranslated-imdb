Poor Shirley MacLaine tries hard to borrow some gravitas for this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she is trampled by the secluded sentimentality of a movie that is not least grounded in reality. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Curtis Hanson? Has he had a lobotomy since we last heard from him? Hanson can make an effective drama strewn with comedy, as evidenced by the "Wonder Boys." So I don't know what happened to him here. These are the kind of movies that will not accept that life is messy and pushy, and that neat, tidy endings (no matter how impeccable they may be) can create a good closure, but come across as completely fake if the people see the movie has been through something distant as what the characters in the film go through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I made a game of calling out the plot points before they happened - eg. "The old one will teach her to read and then fall dead." Bingo! This is one of those films where the characters give small speeches that sum up their emotional problems so you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what causes them. Toni Collette (a great actress by the way, and one of my favorites, if they haven't got much to work with here), tells early why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, spelling out the blinking neon movie's awkward link motif. At that moment, I knew what I was in, and the movie was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
