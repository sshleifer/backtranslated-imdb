A time to kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one who did not cloud him to fame. (It would be done by the "company"). That's why this movie wasn't made until much later, after Grisham was off, knocking out pointless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in the head. In fact, unlike most of them, this book was about something. It had meat it had weight and it had heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a fatal error and this fatal error is translated into the movie. Thus, "A Time to Kill" is set up. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson), in trial for the murder of two white men brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. And by the way, it's all based on racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men who are crossing. In other words, we should sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We must believe that a father who loves her daughter is entitled to kill the men who raped her. We were to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We are supposed to feel that we are with the people who chanting "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the problem of racism is a smoke screen and the whole thing is constructed. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact is that he was not innocent. This would have been true, no matter what his skin color or skin color of his daughter's judges, judge, jury or anyone else. <br /> <br /> And what's so hard on this movie is that it paints anyone who thinks Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be taken in people's own hands, then you might as well burn a cross on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. As a movie, a time to kill pretty much remains true to the book, and the play is not half bad. But it played the hand it had been handled really. Even a good throw cannot raise bad source material.
