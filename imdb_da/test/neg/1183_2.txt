*** Can contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had very high expectations for this movie, based on the trailer. I knew a little about the real Ed Gein, so I figured this was an intermediate Hollywood version of the real events. The man I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the writing came from an eight-degree that hardly knew anything about Ed's story and donated the script in about 20 minutes. The film passes completely over Ed's most interesting facets and his relationship with his mother (not to mention the right police in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young substitute who looks like he just walked on the set. Likewise, all the male characters seem to ad libbing their dialogue throughout the film. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Let me not even start with the historical goofs in this movie. Seriously, who in the hell corrected this? This film will take place around 1957, but the police have modern side-managed batons, some of the things in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes, and when the policeman comes to a phone, he calls 9-1-1 (did not exist then) . Ed was also a little guy, scary like Anthony Perkin's character in Psycho (who was probably based on real Ed), not this burly guy who ended up looking too much like the bad guy in Men In Black. /> <br /> Another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this movie shot everything in an abandoned, 3-set kit. Because of the "clever" camera angles, you never see any real city, and the interior of the kits looked like old, abandoned shacks. Pop a cash register on a saw-horse and bam! - Instant hardware store. <br /> <br /> I'm usually pretty forgiving for low budget horror movies, but one just asks for it. All you have to do was include most of the real events (even spoil them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones, and for Pete's sake, take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
