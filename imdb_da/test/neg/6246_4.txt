Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series. Just think about it: It's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that nobody really cares about! So how could it even be good? Well, it's not! But since then should slasherfilm be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the entertainment field we have seen better, it is also safe! As you can see, I'm not sure where I stand by this movie. Those who look at slashers only for nudity will be more than happy. This movie is all breasts, but unfortunately no blood or enough. I think I'm generous with this movie because I was happy to watch it, and I really enjoy watching slasher movies, just as bad as they sometimes are. If you want me to be sincere, Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and all the others are a waste of time so I think I have a lot of time to waste !! For more fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
