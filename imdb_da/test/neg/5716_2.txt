You know this movie is in serious trouble when the best acting is the supporting role Arnold Schwarzenegger plays. While this was still relatively early in his career and he was not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film shows that the only reason she received much attention was her breasts and because she was involved in the incredibly self-destructive football player, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of being her "break out movie", this and a Beverly Hills Cop movie brand are as high as she did in her one-note career. It was also obvious that the funding guides also gave up on this movie because the supportive cast (except Arnold) is rather lame and the script is boring, boring and boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would undoubtedly be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving movie.
