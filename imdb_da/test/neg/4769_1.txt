Firstly, I saw another reviewer say that this movie was "amazing". Well, nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is complete waste !!! A moronic horror comedy that is NOT even fun !! Do not assume that it is so bad that it is good because it is not. It's a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this waste of a DVD. A group of friends come together for a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video. They grab the mother and father's video camera and begin to come up with scenes on the spot. They all get a big kick out of seeing themselves mug for the camera. They reckon, if they think it's fun, then everyone will think it's fun. Well, they are wrong. This backyard home video is waste. The "acting" and comedic gore effects are miserable, but I think it can be expected as it is nothing more than a home video. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, I guess the fact that this crap came out giving hope to someone out there who wants to make a movie. If these people could get their movies made and released on DVD, then anyone! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
