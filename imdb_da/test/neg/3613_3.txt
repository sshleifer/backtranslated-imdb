I will not vote for this movie as a horrible, mainly because I kind of like it, I was one of those summer days that I was so sad to do something and decided to rent a movie in the stupid section of videostore. In addition, I did not sleep nearby before, and the film got me awake ... Let's just start the autopsy, OK, the movie has a strange plot, first is isolation, which is an expedition, they are isolated on an island because there is no gas on the boat, so there is not a single convincing performance on the part of the actor (hitherto), the main problem starts after the isolation idea, POV of a hose and then another ... then another, then snakes that change, so false spooks, many of them, and when we think that the movie goes in a good way so that we can avoid the excitement, we fail because after ten or eleven ghosts we are not carried away, the scene that unmistifies everything, the scene, when we experience a drunk lesbian show, seen by snakes that seem to dance, and after that it is not a horror adventure, but a comedy-driven movie, the fairy tale part is also removed. /> <br /> For me, the problem in a movie is the third act, it's the one section that just runs the movie to an already guessed conclusion, or if it succeeds, we didn't notice it as a ninja smoke in our eyes well .... The snake island has a bad conclusion, it all comes to a "book" ending with a confronted, persecution and escape sequence, it was predictable the moment I rented the female copy. The other real problem is concept, concept is very important, that is why you believe in dinosaurs come to life or a corpse of seams that just want to live, the main concept of snakes who want revenge after decades of torture of the human civilization, well ... hmmm, just glues to the wall. One thing you will enjoy (if you see it with an open mind) are the more bz sequences, naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera angles, the meninges with the grass cutter, the black guy doesn't die first, and that's all ... if you will see snakes, black dudes and comedies, and you prefer bigger budgets, go see "snakes on a plane". <br /> <br /> Hasta moviegoers
