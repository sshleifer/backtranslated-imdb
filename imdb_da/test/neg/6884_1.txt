I've seen this movie (movie?) By chance and I've never stopped watching because it's so ridiculous that any dog ​​can play this action and get better as the actors (actors?) Of this poor remake of Fatal Attraction are there no control, no games, just an unfortunate copy of Adrian Lyne movies, if you have any doubts about suicide, see this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I can't imagine me people who went to the cinema to see this nonsense; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose the first movie theater near the house to stay 2 hours with someone else to forget about problems, but it's hard to go home relaxed
