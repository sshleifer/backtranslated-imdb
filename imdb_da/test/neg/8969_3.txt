Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early career is a treat, and at this level, the movie is fun, but she's terribly mistaken as Hill Billy. Her famous New England resignation slips through and makes lines like, "I'd better rustle some Vittles" pretty ridiculous. She is so beautiful and so young ?? It almost overcomes this big mistake. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and in addition, a younger generation can think of these beautiful corny things, but it was American entertainment well in the 1940s. It has its moments, but you may need to be a die-hard movie buff to appreciate it.
