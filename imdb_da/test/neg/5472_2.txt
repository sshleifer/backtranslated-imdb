Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man of the successful Greek Giallo-esquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974; And yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is this complete load of drift! God only knows what ran like Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to steal in this cheapie devil worship flick, but I really hope they were well paid as no one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children leading another group to go after them. The pace of the plot is very slow and it ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also far from being original, and anyone with just a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a little like this and undoubtedly done much better. The obvious lack of budget is constantly felt, and the film is unable to overcome this at any time. This is really a depressing and miserable watch and not even a little decent ending up enough for ante to lift this movie out of the bottom of the barrel. Extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended!
