There's so much not to like about this show, it's hard to know where to start. Inaccessible characters, horrible plot lines, horrible writing, and horrible action. Don't even let me start with the unpleasant theme music. <br /> <br /> On top of all that the show is out of touch with the American audience because of the heavy Canadian references, everyone is through it. "Oh, say Derek, will you go to Queens College in the fall! How are you praying? We'll break." <br /> <br /> Permitted, other shows are filmed in Canada for economic reasons such as Stargate: Atlantis, but while the shows may have some of some annoyances (as Rodney calls a ZPM a "Zed-PM") show did not focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs the Degrassi (another show based on Canadian teenager's experiences) during the daytime when no one is looking to fill up time (most teenagers are in school when it airs). I bet it is for the same reason. Views that focus on teenage life in Canada do not translate well into an American audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in an oven.
