Parts: Clonus Horror is not that bad for a movie. I have the MST3K version of it on tape and it's fun, but it's still not the worst movie it has ever done. I would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they made fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent players. It could have been a classic if it wasn't so boring and had a little more excitement. Unfortunately, it was hit in production and ended up at MST3K.
