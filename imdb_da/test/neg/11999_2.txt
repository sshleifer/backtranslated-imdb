Ladies and gentlemen, let's introduce you. Toltec! This ancient Latin American tribe, even ahead of the Aztecs, apparently had the most vicious and bloodthirsty wizards, but they get their donkeys spotted by a few colleges and a hundred and fifty-year-old lawyer with a whip! But before you get to see this, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of boring boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any really sleazy. If I haven't made myself clear yet: "The Dark Power" is an indescribably cheesy and scary piece of 80's scare band that still manages to be entertaining because of its clean and somewhat charming stupidity. Author / director Phil Smot's intentions were, of course, admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast & crew ?? lacked talent and financial means to deliver something even half decent. Smoot followed carefully with "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic theme films, and somehow he might have thought he could pull it off as well. The film opens with an old Indian guy who dies in his isolated country house; hardly speaks his last word over a whisper ?? Toltecs. His grandson quickly rents houses for a bunch of college chicks, including a typical 80's aerobic babe, a sweet black girl and a racist redneck gal. Soon they will discover why exactly the old Indian lived like a hermit when he was actually the guardian of an old Toltec burial ground. The Toltec wizards buried themselves alive, only to reappear thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of living people. And, frankly, is there any better taste than bimbos? As indicated earlier, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and sleepy. Clich√©d pranks, the retarded dialogues and the ridiculously overlaid recordings of Lash LaRue swing around his whip seems to go on forever. Then the movie loses its last smithy of credibility when the Toltec wizards come out of the ground. Instead of threatening, they look like driven hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunk movements. Precisely, a gory moment is worth mentioning when a guy's lips stretch over his entire skull, but generally the blurred aspect of this movie is also disappointing. The only remote-controlled moments are completely meaningless, which reaches a 9-year-old child (named Cletus!) Spearheading his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working. Seriously, unless you are turned on by the sight of a 1940s western veteran who swings around his whip, I recommend skipping this movie.
