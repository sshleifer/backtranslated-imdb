Total disgrace! Really terrible! The play and dialogue are a joke and combined with a director who has no idea of ​​life in Saudi Arabia. It is not a surprise, quite saudi movies have, the director is Palestinian-Canadian, the author is Lebanese, the leading actress is Jordanian, and the slider took place in Dubai, and all these elements show very well to make the film far from representing the Saudi Arabian community. Yes it contains some Saudi clichés, the things we see in cartoons in the newspapers every day, but it's all about it. The film had the opportunity to show real problems with the Saudi Arabian community or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth problems and concerns in Saudi Arabia, but instead copied and pasted it here and there, and the result was a mess. Even the alleged love story in the movie does not exist or at least we have not seen it. The only bright side of this total debacle is some good actors from the supportive casting. Veteran Khaled Sami was fun in a poorly written role as the great father he obviously misunderstood, for he looks younger than the actor playing his son. Also the actor who plays the fanatic brother's role, Turki Al-Yusuf, has done well, in fact he was the best actor in the movie. The rest of the player, who was a professional for a long time, did a good job, but the main actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just bad. He had a look at a little cute bobby for all situations. He couldn't even say his lines in a proper way. He has charisma that made him win the title Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and he's good at interviews and TV shows, but he was just the weakest link in this movie. The leading actress I didn't mind much, but even she acted badly in some scenes and superimposed her sensuality unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> The movie was a big hit, Saudi flocked thousands to the adjacent Bahrain and Dubai to join it when it was screened there, and it made a ton of money, then it was screened in pay per view, then broadcast TV, and it was for a few seconds. This was for cash on Saudi's eagerness to have homemade entertainment, but unfortunately; The film was neither homemade nor entertaining.
