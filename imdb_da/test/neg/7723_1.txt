I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commands were fighting zombies before. But they didn't seem to see a zombie before. Jump and turn your back on them as amateurs. Second, the characters are rather poorly written. The actors did the best they could with what was given, I owe bad writing and poor instruction. Finally and here is where spoiler warnings are highest. They lose the test twice, and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know if she has been a little or not. How stupid is that? As much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think that you would know, plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good track. Stupid, the first movie had it missing, but again it has surveillance, unlike this disaster in a movie that I could hardly get through once. I GIVE HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO GUTS, ALL STUPIDITY CRAP-O-LANTERN
