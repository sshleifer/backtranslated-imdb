This movie is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed, and if Jane Austen lived, she would require her name to be removed from the movie. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the evolution of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a comment on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story and thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would make the novel right. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the film's historical accuracy. In the film, the dance, where Darcy snubs Elizabeth, is not the refined dance of the gentry belonging to Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families, but rather the dance in the lower classes. The gentry would not have danced as if they were on a farmer's barn dance. There are also costume and hair problems. The use of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear the bonnet when they were outdoors. The regent's women were not so liberated that they should renounce the engine's demands on the public. The worst historical inaccuracy is Elizabeth's early morning meeting (in nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and west), where they admit their love to each other. This is an unforgettable freedom with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of the door in such a state to undress or attempt to meet any of the opposite sex at such an early hour. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all with this movie is the lack of Austen's dialogue and the terrible modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue does not need any help from an author who believes that he / she can write as Austen. The author of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent, but has nothing for Austen's style either. The composition of the two styles is crushing. <br /> <br /> For the play, the best of Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy, is performed. Brenda Blethyn takes some freedoms to make Mrs Bennet less horrible than Austen's depiction. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is overjoyed. His affected British accent is horrible and he portrays Mr. Banned too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father in the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's depiction of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a beautiful Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knightly focuses on Elizabeth's sincerity, but her depiction completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of times. She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and to investigate the behavior of women during the period. <br /> <br /> If you make a period movie, you must be true to period. This movie needed a historical advisor who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better understanding and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to make a movie of Pride and Prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our mind. The best thing to say about this movie is that it contains many beautiful scenes on the English landscape. Chatsworth is used well as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But beautiful scenes and beautiful actors cannot save this movie. True fans of Austen will hurry home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text to wipe this version from their minds.
