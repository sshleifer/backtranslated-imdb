If you are a Pauly Shore fan, you will laugh your ass out. If not, it's a silly mess that wastes some very good talent. A sweet coed (Carla Gugino) from South Dakota invites her California college dorm counselor (Shore) home to share Thanksgiving. Remarkable cast members: Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams and drop dead beautiful Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. See where you go.
