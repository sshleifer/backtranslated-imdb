** out of **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 is equal to 23, which was my departure grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes past the 23rd hour. Assign the number you choose and you need to be very scared. Be terrified when you throw in a brain death looking to go by 23, and you have Schumacher's latest attempt at a dark excitement with number 23. Oh yes, 23 is also my record in Cuervo's shot at my favorite dive on 23rd Street in the 23. State of the Union. <br /> <br /> Carrey wears the film, if it's halfway, so we lose him, don't care much. Don't look for some crazy expressions that come from the comedian Carrey, as you've seen in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And don't expect an embodiment of a character that he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for Jimbo. Where is Riddler when you need him! I know we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underutilized as the supportive, speculative, and peculiar wife. Her talent, like Carrey, is suppressed and it is almost painful to see her try to save her underdeveloped character from almost anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give credit where credit is due, there are a few interesting scenes in number 23 that show some very nice cinematography. They probably arrest on their own without having to coincide within the incoherent tale of this silly story. I don't know about you, and I realize this is a work of absolute fiction), but I don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a soft basement or spends his time in cemeteries on a regular basis, like Carrey do in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood-red and gloomy and rainy and tasteful and gloomy and rainy and soft and to and from and to and from the beginning to the end. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more daylight in them and we're talking about medical students who are obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie even though it is out of Just Curiosity ... make sure you do it while enjoying around 23 catnaps, that way you can kill 23 birds with a stone.
