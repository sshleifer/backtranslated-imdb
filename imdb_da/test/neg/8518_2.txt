Eddie Fischer was simply poor. Possibly the worst scene came early in the film as he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently located staff. The song was quite stupid ... I think I could dronkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed that and probably win a Grammy. So, as if the authors could come without any better way to escape the ridicule of the scenes, Fischer says something that comes with, "Don't tell (paste the guy's name). He doesn't like music" and smiles. I can't describe how bad this is, I felt a little embarrassed. And the guy Debbie Reynolds is working with and who always hits her is so annoying too. I can't even imagine somebody like her wasting some of the time on him. The scripts were delivered without any chemistry between characters that made the film's crawl. At least the baby had sweet hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who were like a swan among ugly ducks. <br /> <br /> See Bachelor Mother instead.
