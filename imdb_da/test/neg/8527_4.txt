Directors of "The Messengers" Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and its successor and their premiere American image play as "The Grudge" little in a yard. A family of four moves from Chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural North Dakota. Generally, their teenage daughter Jess begins to see ghosts. Of course, her parents and the police are skeptical. Permitted is the film well created and there are two or three effective scary, but depends too much on the 'boo' effect. In the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the end is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful. Scares are also on the low page with a tendency to CGI. The overall "messengers" is a rather faint scare movie that simply doesn't deliver.4 out of 10.
