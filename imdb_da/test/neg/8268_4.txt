You just have to see this as a badly executed anti-abortion propaganda and you will realize how bad it really is. The main film in this movie is that even the most sick of people cannot commit an abortion. If you ask, it is not far from blowing abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill some poor girls, but he must convince her to do an abortion first. What a lot of crap. And the worst part is that he has a convincing argument (bringing a child in a loving environment), but it must be rejected because he is a freak anyway. And that part with the Bible pushes ... first they throw this girl out just because she explains that someone stole their money (that rule must be in the Bible somewhere) and then finally they are a kind of angel who deus ex Machina delivers the killer from evil by harassing him in his front yard. Come on. Other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and I don't mean in a good way) ... so this guy is just some psycho why? Because his mother fed his liver once? And I don't know about the rest of you, but he seemed like the best person in the world in the whole movement! even though he was a girl with girls, money and taped girls stole in his car. If you forget the idiotic story, this movie has a really good filmography, and Bob Hoskins was really good and it has one of the funny little English cars in it. If it were actually some psychic killers, I would give it a minimum 7.
