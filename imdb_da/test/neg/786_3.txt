Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: It's a stellar force, but "The Box" shows once again that it's not a guarantee of a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: A couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone will die, someone they probably don't know. So what are you doing ? This gives us an interesting story in approx. 30 minutes. Then the story is tracked completely. Guard an uninspired plot lines about a foreign conspiracy involving NASA, nothing is really explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story, it explains the continuity errors.
