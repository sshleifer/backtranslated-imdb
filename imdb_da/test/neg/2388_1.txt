Fire Guys (Jacks) enter the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense. They allow themselves to be mistreated worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without just leaving the situation. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope I can resell this item to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> It's true it keeps your attention if you can't let the illogical plot developments interfere too much. However, it is very silly throughout but especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
