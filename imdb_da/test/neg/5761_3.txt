The monster will look very familiar to you. Then the rest of the movie, if you've seen half a dozen of these teens-caught-in-the-woods movies. Okay, so they're not teenagers this time, but they might as well be. Three couples decide that it might be a good idea to check out an almost abandoned ghost town, hoping to find the gold that people were killed in half a century and a half before. You would think that with a title like "Miner's Massacre" some interesting things could happen. They don't. In fact, only approx. 1/10 of the film in the mine. I had imagined that scary teams of dreaded miners were scampering for their lives in their work area's injuries and asking for Black Lung Disease to get them before Grim Reaper demanded his pigs revenge, but instead I got earthly twenty somethings fornicating And in a case of defecating - in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective IQ would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No excitement, no scares and lots of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.
