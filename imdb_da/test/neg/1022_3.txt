Formal film about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilean who inherits a fortune and is mixed in insane cases and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, although it's nice to see Vargas. Great-looking Chilean landscapes on display, but Malcolm McDowell's portion is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside usually plays a bad guy, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. Chase scenes are standard fare.
