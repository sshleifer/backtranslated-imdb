There is a famous novel about a man who turns into a prey of a safari owner who has lost interest in hunting anything but humans. It's pretty good and it has been done and redone in movies and television many times. Some are remarkable, but this urbanized version, which injects the tired old racism themes, just flat out stinks. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can't stop dancing fun, but I think it's fun in a pathetic freakish way, but it's just not enough to carry a movie. You have the usual Nazi team over or neo-Nazi, whatever you have to think, write villain, who is son of course gay, German accents ... get the picture?
