I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. It's the only movie I've ever gone out of in the theater. My mom, dad and I all looked at each other under the film and knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole approx. 45 minutes in my life. Everything about it was ridiculous. The whole assumption was too skewed. Being 9, I was always easily entertained. This movie showed that I could not submit to anything and still be entertained.
