Right after seeing the first one and it's very stupid. I happened to see an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour. The 11th time should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> It's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. No mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency things. In a cloning program, they bring a caretaker to pay for failed embryos to a church and have him kneel before the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask for forgiveness ... and also tell them how bad the guy is as they can move the plot on. Now it is science in the workplace :( <br /> <br /> There is a stupid, not good stupid where Picard rages on a television announcing skin war that makes you look younger and shouting "It's a lie "as his Randy female assistant gets jailed by the local hot bobbie next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named for Pinnochio's girl to move the lumpy plot together, waves in Picard from the street when she comes in a taxi. Picard is a floor up and he sees a window wildly out ... she came away. He liked trying to run down .. or maybe call the police .. or maybe get the number on the taxi and call it in or maybe have other than ... I wave and come into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ends .. mahhahahahah. <br /> Shame it is so silly. At one point, a grieving father is convinced by Picard that even If a replica clone was born, it would never be his son when his son had a soul. hat is real people. The general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that each soul is unique and sure why otherwise you will clone. <br /> <br /> Although the general scientist Picard finds cloning a bit boring, he is totally up for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that the accident will hit humanity if it is not allowed. He has a rather stubborn rant about how important it is. Of course, he does not mention a single example. That kind of summarizes the show. Buzz words and tawdriness.
