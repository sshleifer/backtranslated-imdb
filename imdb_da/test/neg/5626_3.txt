Let Freedom Ring probably be made with the best intentions, but it sends a curious mixed message in the end product. <br /> <br /> The people of a western city where the railroad crosses are overwhelmed by the arrival of migrant workers working on the railroad financed by robber baron Edward Arnold. There are a few ranchers and farmers whose land is in the railroad way and these peoples are briefly dealt with by Arnold's hired men. A man who will not give in is Lionel Barrymore whose son comes home from Harvard, a lawyer and ready to take up the ranch's cause. Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go Zorro on the evil guys. But apart from Charles Butterworth, no one knows that he is Wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way). <br /> <br /> What Arnold has done is using the tried and true methods of the Eastern political leaders who make the immigrants vote. Nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy Arnold is, they vote with the original settlers and hit the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railway workers are a really mixed bunch of immigrants, not the Irish who work west or the Chinese work east as history has it. It's a real UN working on Arnold's railroad. The workers are kept in line by foreman Victor McLaglen, and Nelson has the inevitable task of turning a sense into him as John Wayne did in The Quiet Man. Of all the movies that played Jeanette and Nelson and they certainly came down in history as a duo, it was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is being stuck with Barrymore for crimes that are, at best, undefined, but certainly not worth getting stuck to. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's boyfriend, saves the day with a rendition of the My Country Tis of The, which immigrants participate in. Unlike a rebellion of his paid for immigrant voters, Arnold rationally packs and leaves the city to build his railroad another place. <br /> <br /> I won't let you go, it's the end here. What is the message, voting with the settlers and losing their job with Arnold? But somehow you come in here? <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder about 20 years after the episodes in this movie take place and the city is in a sleepy backwater in the west, while some cities where the railroad has come through are cities that The good citizens of that city have not rethought about what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they probably run on a rail. <br /> <br /> Of course, Nelson is in good voice and has a number of concerts and popular pieces to sing, including a ballad for the immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg Where else but here. The song is a warm tribute from an immigrant who did well in his adopted country. Too bad it didn't have a better place. <br /> <br /> The almost platinum lace Virginia Bruce I'm sure is baptized here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy that she didn't accompany Nelson on this journey west.
