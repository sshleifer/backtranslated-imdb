This movie is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! The act is ridiculous, and Corman has not improved any of his piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). It does Piranha II: The spawning looks as if it belongs to the American Film Institute List.
