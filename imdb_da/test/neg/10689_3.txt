Given the budget and inexperience of all involved, Livin 'tha Life could have been worse. Jamal will be Chris Tucker (who I have always found very annoying), as a previous commentator has noticed, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) reactions go too long (a director's problem), has Some relatively subtle and fun moments like when trying to instruct Jamal on the right method to smoke with a friend. Throughout, he is usually more clear and independent than Jamal, who could have been the seed of a good exploration of the contrasts in the relationship, but was not developed very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of the author / instructor / cinematographer / etc. is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a closeup? Even Ed Wood could make a close up. I don't think it's much of a budget problem. I could only give a general description of what one of the actors looks like, and not just because of no close-ups, but the lighting ...! Outdoor light shooting can cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! It would have had to move the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot and help solve the close-up problem at the same time. If it's too technical, you can turn the actors around so they aren't in the shade or you can expose the shadows, and if it wasn't shot at L.A., I'd say take advantage of cloudy days. It goes without saying that the movies that it steals from are all with the possible exception of Bernie's weekend, better than this, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if it hadn't made the viewer scare all the way through just to get a glimpse of what the human element might have been. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in barbershop is just stupid.
