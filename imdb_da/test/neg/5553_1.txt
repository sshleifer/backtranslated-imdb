Apart from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), a look of Henny Youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really was nothing really good about this movie. Why is it currently rated 5.3 and loved by some reviewers are beyond me - the movie is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I would have expected from Director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s, Lewis was known for making a number of incredibly low budget utilization films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. But in recent years he has been dubbed "father to gore" and he has many, many fans - fans who ignore his work and focus only on how groundbreaking some of his films were. But apart from the liberal use of false blood and genuine intestine, his film is purely crap - and does not believe scores of 9 and 10 for his film. It would be like putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre !! <br /> <br /> The film is about a number of very pig murders that happen with strippers. When I say cruel, it is very bloody and ill for 1972 - although today's standards look special, it is amazing. So even though some very devious and cruel murders happen in the movie (I'd rather not explain them - they are from a beautifully funny mind and show a particularly disgusting contempt for women), at least they won't nause you because they were done so bad. It is obvious that in many cases they cut out rubber dolls and mannequins. However, to make them do some of the ill actions, even if they are unrealistic, are quite unpleasant and show a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the movie that police are all idiots is a guy named Abraham Gentry - whose maneuvers and style are very close to actor actor David Lochary from the early John Waters movies. While his acting is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. He could be quite funny and strangely this is the only movie he has ever made !! It was also odd that so many women wanted him - especially because they just didn't seem like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are cretins and idiots who could not act. In fact, I was very hoped MORE would be killed - they really had it coming! None of their actions were at least credible and apparently never responded to a single scene - as most scenes in the movie were worse than any of them in the Ed Woods masterpiece, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. In fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their performance in the movie is that they are willing to take their clothes off. Now I know this sounds right, but most of them were incredibly uninteresting and looked like drug abusers striping to get their next solution. When these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow - Henny Youngman should have said it in the movie)! But given Lewis's budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get. All in all, a blurred forest faucet that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films ... and it says a lot! It's violent (though stupid), anti-women (treats them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish.
