Al Pacino was once an actor who could perform a role without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words, when he could act, he didn't have to speak like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the "F" word as well. This may be the kind of community they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to see what we say in mixed company. I don't remember the exact words a professor used to explain the constant use of profanity, but that was something like that. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and respect for all those who need to listen." Perhaps it's time for Al to take some acting again to sharpen his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worse that McConaughey has played in. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo was as always warm.
