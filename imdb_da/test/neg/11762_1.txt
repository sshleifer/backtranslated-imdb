The few scenes that actually attempt to portray revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop that gently winds between swimming holes. When Sharif or, thank God, Palance, try their hand at the fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz turns off a mistake. The views of strategic splendor incorporate a map of Cuba filled with smiling fishies in the sea and a positive Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the pork bay happened. What does it leave us? A comical dental care scene; an abundance of opity Hollywood farmers addressing the camera as if it were a moving train; and just for kicks, a passport of homoerotism that is not limited to Castro's manic and tireless cigar fellatio. Never believe in one by heart, but even a busted clock is quite twice a day: this is a HISTORICAL horrible movie.
