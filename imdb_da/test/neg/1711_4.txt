While traveling with a team of misses to Miss Galaxy's dispute, the airplane piloted Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) into an isolated, where Noah's Ark is protected by Jurassic Pork. While the group is struggling to survive, alien monkeys promote the use of the ark to destroy humanity and dominate the planet earth. I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an insult to human brain. The horrible story and the special effects are very, but really very bad. There are spoofs with "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Apes Planet", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Congo", "MIB" Perfect Storm ", "Austin Powers", "Jaws", "Mission Impossible", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Star Wars" and "Hulk", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny. is the trailer better than the movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission Almost Impossible")
