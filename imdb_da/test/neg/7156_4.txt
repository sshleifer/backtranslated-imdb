I really hoped for the best with this one, but it just didn't happen. Funded in a very non-Dutch way and still looks good, with a style and a pace that is much like Hollywood. What I don't understand is how all these great benefits - the director, the author, the producer still managed to make this movie a horrible picture to see. Full of bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can't really speak [act] in English. Kudo is to pull it out, but what was this guy thinking!
