I caught a screening of this at the True / False Documentary Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was pretty disappointed. I had expected a cool documentary in the protest and the activism around the RNC, but what I got was a largely flawless, poorly acted, fictitious conspiracy ride badly woven tale. I had heard of his neo-documentary technique, "blends both True and False", but I expected more with a fictional story developed for better personification and creating a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more along the lines in a horrible conspiracy theory TV movie. <br /> <br /> The overall spectacle is horrible except for Rossario, which is not surprising considering the director of the screening that most of the protagonists had no action training, his excuse was that he wanted them to be real. Here's a tip, real people can't act, but actors can usually act right. <br /> <br /> It would not have been so fiercely offensive if it was not obvious how eager he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory on us throughout the film, it is especially hysterical when we get a scene where the instructor comes and starts tearing on ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The film also does a good job of scaring stereotypes every single role it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a great 'Good' or 'Evil' on each character. <br /> <br /> Skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary /
