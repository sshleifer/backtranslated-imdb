this is horrible movie. it's past stupid. First, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in the 7th grade. Not to say I'm a prude or something, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. Being beautiful and popular is not everything. But it's the twins making it to be. The reason is even worse. the girl's grandfather just happens to be ambassador (sp?) to France. He has a colleague, takes the girls around Paris, and they meet two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. they sneak out to meet the boys begin to really like them ETC ..... they meet a supermodel going and going around paris with the total strangers they think are cute. should I say more? this movie can be cute for 8 and 9 year olds. the twins play ditsy losers who want lovers. It does send the wrong idea to girls. The movie itself is not great either. I do not recommend this to anyone. I'm giving passports to paris 2/10
