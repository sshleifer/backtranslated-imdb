Terrible writing, management and action! The author / director has portrayed Southern citizens, especially southern law enforcement as ignorant, backwoods, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant, stereotype that the film industry loves to continue). The play (or overactive) and writing came across as amateurish and low-budget. The baseline is the same old, obsolete Hollywood story of the medieval racist and homophobic rednecks that are ultimately defeated by the enlightened people of "Newwww Yoke Ceety". <br /> <br /> I was raised in the small Louisiana city where this movie was filmed and was looking forward to watching the movie, but was immediately disappointed in the first few minutes of the movie. The start of the film depicts a gay bar located in Louisiana's "swamps". How ridiculous a concept! There are many gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but no gay bars in the "swamps" or small Louisiana towns. We are then introduced to the sheriff, who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern drawl and excessive performance ever. Then there is the scene where the local police watch porn in operation at the police station. I could continue to think of the horrible cheesy acting or the obsolete stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his crew were welcomed in this small friendly town and shown true southern hospitality. The cities of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana should only be insulted and degraded in the final editing. The good people of Lake Arthur were thrilled and enchanted that "Hollywood" was in the city without knowing that they would eventually be portrayed as ignorant, racist, and homophobic landmarks in a low-budget amateur movie that went directly to DVD. My advice: skip this or watch it on late night Cinemax if it ever makes their rotation.
