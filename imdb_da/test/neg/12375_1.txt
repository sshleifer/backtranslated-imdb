The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with movies like 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for the worst movie of all time. A fake giant gripping 'Lionel Trains' in this totally unconscious movie. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to each other is ridiculous. It is no wonder that this film is a primary target in the movie, "It came from Hollywood", where this gem is hammered on the line, "A bird great as a battleship", with a joyous and endless needle. The line shows up relentlessly through the film's progress, so nothing comes of it. There are more shots from 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' and' Earth vs. The Flying Saucers' among other sci-fi films from the 50's to steak up the scraggly grapple attack. At one point, the big gripe is responsible for a few deaths, so the military puts the world under war, and no one has to leave their homes. Of course, the big buzzard is primarily concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow & Mara Corday, wherever they may be. Still, the director is so sorry that he doesn't even provide a couple of lovely Mara honey shots in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller. This is the second time this blunder has been made. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday strives in warm dresses for the entire movie, but is referred to pants throughout, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this movie should not have been more than thirty or forty thousand dollars, and I doubt whether Morrow or Corday made more than three thousand do it. It seems that whole things were shot straight out of any garage.
