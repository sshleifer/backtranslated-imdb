Wow, this movie is bad. Think "Flashdance" with ninjas. The worst part is when a sword is to flow in midair, but you can see the strings. Or perhaps the worst part is the gigantic eye lobe (similar to a coaster) that the good ninja carries. In fact, there are so many bad parts, I can't imagine which is the worst. I can't believe anyone actually put the money up to get this thing done. The only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh.
