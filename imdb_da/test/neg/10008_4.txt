Wealthy horse owners in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trade policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachiode Latin son falls to a particular Crawford with bright eyes, blond hair and some crazy movements on the dance floor? The 20th-century Fox musical has a glossy veneer, but seems a little tattooed around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gym-like dance, very thin on the story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement of Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she is mated to the leaden Don Ameche (in tan makeup and smooth hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver still sleeping at work, and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?). The stock photos in Argentina are far beyond the action taken on Fox backlot, and some of the supporting notions are quite horrible. At the time of the big horserace finals, most viewers will have had enough. * 1/2 from ****
