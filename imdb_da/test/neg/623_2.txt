I'm an atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still updated until today, as if it were a history book. Well that's not it. The film is about the novel 1950s version. Some actors were big, but it doesn't cover the plot. <br /> In short, you will find a superb bomb so that God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they should intervene. The devil's analogy pursues man, and for defense we have the human spirit. What is the human spirit anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually, you just get American Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First we get the caveman story. The women are scary stereotypes of damsels in distress. Real hollow women were as strong as men and equally resilient. Hard times, hard life, adaptation and survival. All this is the water in the mid-century stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Then we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today we see another story and know that there were also many fewer deaths and regular citizens at work. Losing the number of lives in the process would have been a national disaster, and no one would try to beat it. As if there was only one pyramid building. <br /> <br /> The party about Moses and a true god was as if the Spanish Inquisition asked nicely. The Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Helen's evil ugly was so silly that I couldn't see why so many were just interested in her. In fact, they were just soldiers who followed the commanders' orders, which "discussed" a political power problem. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was where I saw that this movie was wrong and filled with propaganda. Here, brother was much younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore library content and was politically competitive to pull Egypt out of dirt. <br /> <br /> The part with Nero and the Christians in a cave was disgusting. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, persecuted Christianity. But the way they portrayed was as if the Colosseum was building itself, and there was no vespasian to rebuild Rome. Attila She turns out briefly and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the Crusades east to Russia, which ended in an ironic blow. The knights went straight home and began to enjoy it. A lot of things are put down like no pluming, hygiene and ailments. <br /> <br /> They cover Joan of Ark, where she always has a lot of makeup and looks like a prince. Territorial policy was replaced by an unjustified court. The side saddle alone on a stool causes me to ask how anyone could follow here. By burning here, I would shout "Hura! Now already die! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?". <br /> <br /> When they mentioned Leonardo, I was already preoccupied with the movie. Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, cried Queen Elisabeth "save the Spanish armada" and so on. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was that it was the last with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and the Indians. Entertaining, but no more than a smile. The witch hunters are mentioned short and bad (after renascence). When they begin to portray revolutions, things are emptying power-hungry and anarchist. The American Revolution was pursued by the French Revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way out of anger, you have to replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by country. But they replace their motives with unity and bind him to only the title "Emperor". The conquests in Europe, defeat in Russia are laid off for Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The American Civil War, the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). "Mister Watson, come here, I want you" almost made me laugh at teenagers. Technologically hard work was watering down to the final discovery and comedic abuse. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 85 minutes, we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolf's words "I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand" was fun. It was his last territorial demand. <br /> <br /> To create excitement, God puts a countdown timer to doom on the "wall" of the final words. All might not break the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution, but the defense made a final throw. <br /> <br /> Lastly, we see tomorrow's man as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man because the bomb was going today. His toy is a music box in the form of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now it's so wrong ?? Pencils and pencils draw so many weapon drawings that its kill count exceeds the atomic bomb. And make music out of a weapon? Deluded selfish generals make music out of fire. So tomorrow's husband is already a monster. The way I see it all the defense must do is because of the devil as the true conspirator for the death of men and the case closed. And frankly, compared to all barbaric things, our ancestors have been pretty humane for centuries by painless backstabbing these days. To sum it all up, I just want to quote Firefly's episode "Jaynestown": "It is my estimation that every man has ever got a statue from him, was a kind of dental son, or someone else. is about what they need. "
