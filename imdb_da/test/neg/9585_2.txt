This is the worst exercise in middle-class pretentiousness yet to hit our TV screens. Unfortunately, I couldn't see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of seeing six hours of unpleasant drift - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig, who has been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore knows that she is capable of the best of comedy parts. But she also played this part, and she could consider the lack of some decent comedy material. Please keep in mind that the Trades Descriptions Act may be invoked if you continue to count as comedy material, which is at best pseudo-psychological romance and, at worst, a drama that constitutes a quirky comedy to conceal it the fact that there are no fish or birds.
