I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I'm surprised someone took it seriously. Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the evil ones. The only profit here is that it's so boring, it's fun. In fact for me there is the added benefit of being shot in a state park, not far from where I live, so it's a lot to see some local sights on the big screen. The protagonist is an off-duty policeman and makes a great point of refining a good guy that vigilant justice is not just a bad idea it is against the law. Imagine how long it lasts ... <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's northern California characters are blustered Hollywood cheese balls, just as they have never been in battle. The story is completely predictable. This movie is ripe for a MST-3K lampooning. Only CAMP value. I am pretty forgiving for movies in general, but see the old positive reviews I had to speak up. This is a dog. I give it a 3 out of 10, and then only for laughs.
