Willies begins late one night as brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camping outside with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), deciding to pass the time by telling scary stories ... <br /> <br /> First up is Michael with a story titled "Bad Apple", where a young boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is bullied at school, but the scary new guardian Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him out. . Next time, Kyle as he tells a strange story called 'Flyboy', where an overweight bull with a disturbing fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way ... <br /> <br /> Posted and directed by Brian Peck Willies didn't do much for me and I doubt it will do much for you either. The script is weird, as far as episodic anthologies go, instead of the usual three or four stories, it has only two main stories and some bizarre "urban myth" scenes at first, these consist of the person ordering food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken, a man dying from a heart attack on a trip and a person trying to wipe her poodle away in the microwave only to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they do not add anything to the movie, as to the two main stories, they are both weak. For a start, they are too long, which is a big mistake in these types of movies. Usually, the stories in anthologies are short, sharp and quick with a nice twist at the end, which usually involves people getting what they deserve. But in The Willies, the stories in the best part of 40 minutes tell everyone who is longer than the average TV episode and I have to admit that I found both stories very boring, they have very little to go to them and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is better to see as a whole, but it has no twist as far as I can see, while the other has a nice 'just deserts', but the structure is weak and pulled out for no good reason. I really like horror anthology movies, so Willies comes as a disappointment, honestly lets the genre down. <br /> <br /> Of course, Director Peck worked on a low budget and as a whole The Willies is pretty hard to get through, there are lots of continuity errors and it's badly made. There is no atmosphere, there are no scares, no gore, special effects are poor and it contains unnecessary shots on a dirty toilet several times. Overall, it's a pretty uncomfortable movie to sit through. Technically, the Willies are coarse around the edges and certainly, the effects are far from special and it has an extremely dull and grainy appearance in the image. The actors are bad, no one will win any awards, that's for sure. Willies is a bad movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining and it has only two long stories. Definitely not recommended.
