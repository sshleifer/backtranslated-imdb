The greatest effort to achieve some success in adapting the classic Odyssey story to a 30-year nostalgia period. The fairy tales this time are escaped prisoners who wander about depression, who are afflicted south, embark on problems. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the movie is the wonderful music soundtrack that effectively evokes not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run violently in the movie. Besides its value for the film's tone, the music is just plain fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> What the champion movie is, the characters really aren't that cozy. In a comedy, you need that element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, rare, meaningful germinated nobodies who have no positive things at all. They don't introduce enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They are offered as clowns, but like people putting clown makeup on and marching in parades, they're just not fun. As the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an "odyssey" that encounters a number of symbolic (some even mysterious) characters. Everyone is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid". People are mucked right and left and therefore no one is left to be particularly interesting or appealing. The movie does not like its own characters, nor does it like you. <br /> <br /> Riverside baptism, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being beaten with sticks; everyone is thrown into you in a different way. Some evoke some laughs, others confuse or drill you. I laughed when a nerdy guy struck out a particularly unpleasant main character. But there were much more meaningless free scenes; an example: some '30's Dillinger-type guy is penalized queues with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? None; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual character of the original source material that this story draws on. <br /> <br /> Other adjustments to the Odyssey are much better. Unless you are a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy the audio track CD; the music is amazing.
