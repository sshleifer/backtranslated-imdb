my friend and i rented this a few nights ago. And I have to say this is the best single movie I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "Dear, we better get to brew before this joint closes" and "Dear, Linda doesn't wear a bra again." what poetry! Woah! And it's also a wonderful original movie. I mean, you don't usually find a slasher movie where every single murder is exactly the same. I mean exactly! now it's originality. And almost all transitions between scenes are these great close-ups of psycho in ER scrubs. how tough! the play is so wonderful that. Dad was just brilliant. must have studied REAL DADS before the movie. And how many movies do you find that just don't make sense? not many. But it is one of those gems. I mean, how cool is it that a guy was waiting outside, like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside? It's really cool. All in all, I would say that this is the only biggest movie of the genre, no, in the world! *****
