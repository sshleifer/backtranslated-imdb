As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and sad about this movie. The action was OK, but Joaquin Phoenix was a bad casting choice to say the least. What worried me most about this movie was the Celtic music whining on and again and in the worst possible time in the movies. The management and continuity were also pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** After Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly wounded, he can hardly move to talk to his captain on the radio. So miraculously, he manages to crawl over a large room covered with rubble and fire to strike a man-sized opening in a brick of brick with only a foot-length re-bar ???? And to top it all, he gets so weak and busted again. <br /> <br /> Someone has also noticed that throughout the movie, when you see shots of Joaquin fighting and saving people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame-retarded building. <br /> <br /> I also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team shouting "I need some equipment over here !!!". <Br /> <br /> I really thought I would enjoy this movie, but I found it a weak attempt to represent a firefighter's true life. The intention was there, but I honestly think this movie could have been so much better. I couldn't help but believe that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this movie and had to hurry to put it in theaters. More time should have been spent editing and ensuring that there was good power for the movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes, but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. A kind of Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me critically, but I just can't see what's so good with this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as "The Full Ten Yards", which is by far the worst movie I've seen in recent months. I really hope there is no Ladder 50 to do!
