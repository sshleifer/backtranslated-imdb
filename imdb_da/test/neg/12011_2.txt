"Problem Child" was an okay movie, but has it really deserved a sequel? I don't think it did. The original film's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good at this sequel. I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. At first, it just wasn't fun. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I couldn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came to me as whiny, self-assured, and perhaps most importantly, a rebellion without a clue. He seemed to hate any woman who his father Ben (John Ritter) dated alone to hate them. Neither does it send a good message to children with divorced parents (who make up over half children in the United States these days), when one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is alleged and acting for to hate children as it is. <br /> <br /> And as fun as I thought it would have been to see the original SNL cast friend, Laraine Newman came back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white sewing doctor, whose name was Lawanda. It sounds more like an African American woman's name. But of course it has nothing to do with why I didn't like this movie. I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists that you should hate with the main characters you weren't meant to hate. John Ritter's character should be a good parent who desperately tried to teach his child from wrong without complying with authoritative parents. Instead, he not only appeared as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, no matter how well he knew the woman. Did I mention this sends a bad message to children from signposted parents? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie were included by Amy Yasbeck's unnecessary and inexplicable return to playing a completely different character, the young girl who was even more disgusting than Junior, totally unsolicited to the toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). The movie was just a mess and really doesn't deserve a DVD release if it hasn't already been given. It should just mess with VHS along with all the other bad, forgettable 90s comedies.
