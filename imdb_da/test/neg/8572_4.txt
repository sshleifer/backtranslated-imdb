Six pupils in a monastery make it unthinkable - killing a nun that was indulgent. Now eighteen years later, the nuns are back and revenge for her murder. Yes, it is basically the shortest. There is more to it than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed with being a low budget flick. I am also confused with whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is in Italian, but they spoke English in the movie (I think or it may have been called, I still can't tell). <br /> <br /> Yet, the real premise of the movie is quite idiotic, and the end not only makes sense, it ... well ... doesn't make sense.
