The movie is not that bad until ... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the end, so it's a pretty big spoiler ... <br/> <br /> Currently, it was created a beautiful movie and gets a lot of it right. <br /> <br /> But in the book Sam succeeds and lives his dream while in the movie he gives up and goes back to the city and completely destroys "you can do what you think of" theme in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is a desecration, and instead of recreating classics that don't need redone, the Hollywood types who have no better ideas should do this, this time.
