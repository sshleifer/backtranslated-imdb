It is disappointing to see as talented an actor like Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially as he was faced with sensationality in BLACK (which I highly recommend). A line in the film states: "Sakar is not a single man, he is a thought and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma is crediting GODFATHER as inspiration for this movie, and perhaps that is the problem. It seems like a poorly lacking American movie set in India. The left elbow index considers seven elements in film production - acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, art and production set - on a scale of high 10 to a low of 1, with 5 given as an average score. The movie continuity seems high, an 8, by maintaining a violent tone infused with drama in places and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion associated with the evil organized crime. The actors bet a 4, it seems too weak, even if someone is beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. For example, when a character is shot in the forehead, I found myself wondering whether or not he should fall. He does not, and raises Ronald Reagan he is in a car, with his bleeding face cradled by John F. Kennedy. The plot is a 5 as an example of American style gangsterism, with a family-oriented Robinhood upside down. The character development appears static, and the characters act as chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, giving a rank of 3. The dialogue seems to be stalked and seems to be forced to fit some Bowery patterns of speech - a 4 for dialogue. Production set seems to be below average - a 4. And artistry is puzzling, with too many close-ups, for quick panning and too many group scenes where the actors seem to be repeating - a 3. Also for me very camera movement is disruptive. The average of the left elbow index is 4.4, and with a small deduction based on poor derivatism, it moves down to a 4. Two questions arise all the time in the movie: one, why are so many people eating so often: and two does not india have its own brand of organized crime? Should movies like this be so dependent on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can't recommend this movie.
