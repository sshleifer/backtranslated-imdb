I seem to be in the minority on this one, but I found a true thing to be schmaltzy, constructed and generally unpleasant. Not that the play was so bad, but the characters seemed a little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not tirelessly bad, maybe there might be a solution at the end ...). Admittedly, the woman I was with loved the movie, so maybe you would like it. But I did not.
