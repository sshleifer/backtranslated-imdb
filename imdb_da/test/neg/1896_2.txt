I saw the version with pathetic American over-dubs, maybe it made it much worse, but from what I could do, the movie was pretty bad anyway. It seemed low budget. The visions reminded me of another price TV movie, random white dog replaced Dogmatix, embarrassing 60's BBC costumes, etc. Mainly, however, I feel like the characters in the movie did not behave like the characters in the comic book and as a result I never felt willing to myself trying to forgive the poor look of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feel of the comics in a movie without using animation, and I did not feel that this attempt was ultimately worth it.
