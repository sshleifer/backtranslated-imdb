I am shocked that all the "hated" reviews are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems to be the case with "the emperor has no clothes". I understand that this movie was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's ... Whether it was a struggle to sit through and see. The DVD I saw had some subtitles, but approx. 75% of the speech is not subtitle. Some of it is hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear but you struggle not to 'tune out' after a while. Some of the shots were good and realism was there, although some of the performances were not great. (Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The reason is not bad, but quite predictable. In the 1: 43 movie, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene and a couple of shots and battles. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. BTW, near the beginning of the movie, there are some weird cuts with Ivan the character that seems like an editing error that made me laugh a little. One reviewer said that this movie has been cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. The ending was interesting and showed how the media from a young age affect people, it could also be a general comment on the influence of white man / colonialism on Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... Finally, the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile, the film much less.
