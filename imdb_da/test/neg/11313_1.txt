This morning I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I thought to myself, "Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't it?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (the visual impairment group said this movie was diminishing). I even went to watch this movie on the day it opened because I'm a fan of both Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I can even remember opening animated credits because I thought they were pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> Then it's all a complete plot. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so boring, so bland, and so completely without merit that you can't remember any of it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known to appear in top-notch comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard" in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3" and none of them were good movies, but I came away at least remember * something *. Sir. However, Magoo is a completely empty one. <br /> <br /> Now, I wonder if all the controversy about the movie wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, hoping to generate at least a little bit of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.
