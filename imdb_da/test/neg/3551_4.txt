Not even original in the plot. Ho hum, there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows 90% of Hollywood movies. I haven't really "get" Samuel Jackson's performance most of the time in his other films, but he was pretty good at this movie. He rarely shouted and went much further in his character than returning to an "in your face anger". I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and although she is a good eye-catcher, she turns out to be much more than an actress. Luis Guzman was actually really good too, except that I didn't like to change his character to Samuel Jackson at the end of the movie. How can one's character center around an aversion to a former policeman and then become a lollipop within a split second? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood?
