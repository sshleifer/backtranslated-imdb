This is one of the movies you see with a group of people. You get the best time. It's really, really bad, as Showgirls bad, but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad instructor and bad script here. Everything that can be wrong can do for an entertaining evening you have here. The first is the roofline is "a lot of teens ..." These people are just as many "teens" as my grandmother. The director has no sense of tension or excitement. The 30-year-old "teenagers" are standing around and the "monster" is coming out and attacking, and it happens largely throughout the film when monsters are revealed. There is no tension building for this or surprise or anything. It's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of finished stuff as you went. And when I use the word "monsters" I exaggerate. More like a few guys in Halloween masks bought at .99 cents big. There is no doubt that this script was spun out in a few days, no rewrites, and I can only imagine how badly and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur without clue. It's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: everyone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best thing about this movie is the actor. It's just as bad as you can get. There is no one in this who has the least ability to act and the management is the absolute worst. He delivers each line in this monotonous way with no expression, and one must wonder how such a bad one could get into any movie, no matter who he knows. When he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Looking at these people who recite some of the terrible dialogue is very much fun. But when the black guy said "Tell her ... Tell her ... I love her ..." Before his death scene there was a big laugh among our group. Funny, funny stuff. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this movie gets bad enough to take its place where it belongs: in IMDb's lowest rating 100 movies. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. It is no surprise that the one "big" comment this movie got into here was from someone in Virginia (who has a comment, only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I have said so before and I say it again: People who work on the film should NOT be allowed to comment on it.
