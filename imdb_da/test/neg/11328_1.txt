It's hard to believe that a movie, this bad one could actually be released. The dialogue was unnatural. Particularly poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future stiffer. I think you could say they managed to produce inappropriate dialogue, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The excitement was just not there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about which sites should appear on the screen. Fortunately, the movie was on TV, and then I didn't waste money to rent this apologetic excuse for a movie! I honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than what was presented here. It's too bad that the time for a whole movie crew member was wasted on such a garbage can! I think the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.
