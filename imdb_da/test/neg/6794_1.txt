The fact that this cruddy series could produce dozens of comments (much less hundreds of votes) tells volumes about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. Read Proust, you morons! ! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes's anthologies. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains around the fact that to judge or write about this series, you should have spent minutes .. yes, hours ... see this poor sweet step into the boards and spit lines with less emotional impact than crazy used to settle the right time for your local service. <br /> <br /> DO NOT CHOOSE THIS SHOW !! SAVE YOUR FEW REMAINING BRAIN CELLS!
