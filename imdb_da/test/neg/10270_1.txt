Despite the all-star cast, this attempt fails epic. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes that are squeezed by an overly clever social comment. <br /> <br /> It is as if with every dialogue and introduction to a new character the author is looking out and saying "Isn't it smart? Am I not smart? Isn't it a biting social comment?" And unfortunately the answer is always "Ummmm ... no." Use of self-absorbing things that are more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie ... and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Fortunately, it died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
