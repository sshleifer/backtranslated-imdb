I'm a fan of good, plausible, action movies. And I'm a big fan of the elite military units like Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of them was allowed to really enjoy this movie at that time. I gave it another chance recently when I bought the DVD. Here are the problems with this movie on a quick list: 1. It is a poor man's top gun, such as. A virtual music video from the SEAL team that plays golf with a soundtrack of "The Boys is back in town", ending with Charlie Sheen making an inactive chase to get her drawn car back. <br /> <br /> 2. This is simply a Charlie Sheen movie when Sheen tried to be famous before he started doing things like Hot Shots. Reports I have heard suggest that Sheen was a baby on the set and it hit the roles and direction that the rest of the actors in the movie got. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the leader of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely holds him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline that Sheen's character does or threatened the team as he did would not even have done so through BUDS training not to get on a team. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are cross-trained on weapons. But in a part of the movie, a SEAL must "find out" how to use a US Stinger Missile. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes in the movie. The Assault entrance at the start, Bill Paxton as "God," and some of the footage of what was to be Beirut at that time. Overall, this movie is a loser.
