The only reason I controlled this movie was to watch the "early" Kim Bassinger. It and the fact that my TV guide said it was a "gripping excitement" and it was three-star. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drift because the only excitement in this movie was whether or not I would finish it. Robert Culp turns to what should be the "disaster" of his career as a policeman who is not even close to being credible. At some point, EVERYBODY is a suspect, including a weak old woman. If you want to deliberately strive to see a badly written, badly directed, badly acted movie ... then go to it. It can make you appreciate fine movies by comparison. I wish I had the thirty-six minutes back.
