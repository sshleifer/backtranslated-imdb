The reason for this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star force" if we can call it the Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video, read them. Someone even went so far as to say that the actor / writer could be the leading lady in the 90s. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to check it anyway, I highly recommend seeing the MTS version of it. In any case, you will laugh a lot without going crazy.
