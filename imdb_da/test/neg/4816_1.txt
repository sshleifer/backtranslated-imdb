This movie is the worst ever created by humans. Do you think manos is the worst movie ever? It does not even come close to this waste. I don't even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the rebels are the worst "actors" ever to appear in a movie. They make the sister in troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The goofy faces the clever spouse while she is in kung fu training, to be seen as being believed. Then there is the Oompa music under the prison, the incredible love scene, the stupid song that plays under the inability, the love scene, the false castro, the fact that everyone has either a tape and / or a bandana on Part of their body, the divine rape scene ever filmed, and the worst act ever made on film. This movie deserves to be more well-known among bad movie fans. Absolutely the worst movie ever made.
