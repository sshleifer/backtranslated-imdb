I don't even have more time to describe how bad this movie is. Bottom line: It was terribly acted, had huge plot holes and went absolutely NOW. The only good thing about this was the description that my digital cable gave to the movie: "A married man with a fighting business has a fling with his secretary." Huh ?? Wrong movie apparently, though it might have made things a little more interesting if any of the description were true. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
