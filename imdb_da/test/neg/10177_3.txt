My wife saw this movie in the hallway at a local video store. From the cover, it looked like a science-fiction movie, but after turning it over, my wife saw that Rebecca St. James was in the movie, realized it was a Christian movie and suggested we see it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "Christian" movies have a bad reputation in the ordinary. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The musical score - many of which were orchestrated - was quite good. The cinematography was also pretty good, as it was a cheaper movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, every virtue of this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting performance - UFO abductions - but midway through the function, the bigline goes wild into an evangelistic crusade, which is spearheaded by the film's two main characters ... which then goes wild into a thesis on the rapture. At least Frank Peretti-inspired "The Visitation" (who himself was a deeply deficient film) had a playoff that ties the film's premise. "Unidentified" does not end anywhere even near where it started, which is a huge downturn. <br /> <br /> What about the actor? The supporting play ranges from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit and is acceptable.) For their part, a few main characters are crewed enough. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters as one-dimensional in their personalities to be incredible. "Main characters" are anything but; You know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the movie to be the most annoying. A final note about the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be more interesting to Christians than non-Christian readers. In one word it is embarrassing. Other Christian films such as Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" have managed to communicate a truly uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preaching or repressive. This film, on the other hand, is a sledge hammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacks in tact that a non-Christian would have a hard time taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I welcome the effort to create good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is seeking a screening of a good Christian movie, consider "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion" or (if you are the pink star) Robert Duvall's provocative "Apostle". <br /> <br /> As for "Unidentified?" Rent it if you need to, but screen it before showing it to a non-Christian or a larger audience.
