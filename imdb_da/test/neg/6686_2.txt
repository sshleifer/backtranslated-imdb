There was a lot of hype of this movie and the advertisements made it seem like it was great. Unfortunately, as Bring It On 2, bring it to 3 shameful honor of the original Bring It On. There are shameless stereotypes throughout the film. The lines to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the movie. The performance of Hayden Panattiere was sub-par both in acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes where I literally cringed because I was embarrassed by the cast, because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was just as stupid. My recommendation to the decision makers of any future Bring It On movies is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the "actor" of the cast was horrible and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless for the movie. Only great character: Kirresha.
