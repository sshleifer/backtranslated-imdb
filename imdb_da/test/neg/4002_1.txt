A piece of junk would have given it a 0 if I could have. Animation is good, but not quite good enough. Storyline is definitely the most ridiculous I've ever encountered, and it says a lot! This 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but the failure failed. It's almost as if the author started a story, so he got another idea and tried to gather the two together. Don't waste your time on this; Believe me, you will be as crossed by yourself as I was. The only actor of any note in this was James Woods, and his part was at least peripheral. I'm all about doing things that are edgy, pushing the envelopes, but it just doesn't cut it.
