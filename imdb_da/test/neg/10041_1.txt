BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie allegedly based on real events that occurred in the period 1817 to 1821. <br /> <br /> This should not be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. But I can say I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance on Friday the 13th. As such, I think even on a bad day, she would get a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> For my headline, this movie is not painful to see because the content is disruptive. It is painful to see because it is quite boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three options. The first option - these writers were somehow involved in the production. The second option - the authors, while not directly involved, was paid for writing positive reviews after the production was completed. The final option - none of these authors have seen a sufficient number of horror films and are therefore inexperienced with the concepts that successful trials utilize. <br /> <br /> The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A number of supernatural events begin to happen in the home of John Bell and his family. It soon turns out that a devoted spirit is behind it. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot looks like a standard poltergeist affair, albeit based on real events. <br /> <br /> However, where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned, only everything that could go wrong goes wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First acting. The action is almost uniformly horrible across the board. This factor does most damage to production, undermining any credibility of faith or interest from the viewer. The devoted spirit's voice sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage fear rather than a strong demonic force expressing malicious intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have lived in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that any young woman who lived at that time would speak in the way that this "ghost" does! <br /> <br /> Second, the direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but the potential is wasted by the clearly inexperienced instructor. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes that have to be frightening. The atmosphere is just as flat. A spirit of revenge is apparently behind supernatural events. But the effects are so incredibly inappropriate that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I give an example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost fun - almost. <br /> <br /> The third script. While it may be that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real events, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that does not add depth to the characters or story. This movie is too dependent on conversations to promote history. While this style was also the case with British films from the British horror blossom of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchange was always interesting to see in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing could, for example. Read a phone book and still pay attention to the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in the HAUNTEN. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. The poorly led attempts at humor in this movie are scary. An overweight boy is many many jokes. A particularly horrible scene sees the boy mentioned going to the toilet. This scene should never be included - but it is and complete with sound effects if you do not understand what he is doing! <br /> <br /> The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the image near the original location helped add a authenticity. The costumes were also well-chosen. <br /> <br /> All in all, HAUNT is a scary movie. It's not even in "so bad is the good" league. Instead, it's just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother to see it for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the other movie about Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be worse than the HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I would advise everyone here to check out some real horror movies about ghosts and haunting. The legend of HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are great places to start.
