I'm a Boorman fan, but it's probably his least successful movie. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempt at the scrub's farce is well done. Still, it is almost worth looking for Boorman's eye for talent: This is one of Uma Thurman's first leading roles, and as always, she is surprising to see. (On a sad note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
