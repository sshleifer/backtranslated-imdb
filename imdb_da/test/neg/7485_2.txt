Jon Good's Wife (simply one of the worst titles for a movie ever) or The Red Right Hand (another horrible sounding title that means nothing and has no relevance to the movie) that I saw it put in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' (coincidentally the year I was born, which was probably the best thing to happen in the 365 days) where five old colleagues meet for a school association, gay-boy bassoon Roger Mather (John Kuntz, is this surname for real? Just say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa ) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling of 'John' different in the title?) & his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the word, there is an unpleasant tension in the air, and when someone mentions their "missing" friend Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories come back to flooding. Then comes the phone calls, the mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and the blame as the real horror of the events all these years ago finally comes ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executive produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the case & Kurt St. Thomas, who also gets the credit line, and if that wasn't enough, they both act in the movie too! Personally, I thought Jon Good's Wife was horrible, I think she can't cook or anything! Ha ha ha, just fun! Seriously, even though I didn't believe much of the movie together, for a start it is pretty slow, and the whole of the first 30 minutes is solid snooze material from the reunion, which consists of lots of intersection with each other and boring character building position. The film never explains itself, what about the strange nosebleeds for God's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost irreconcilable death of one of the groups that may or may not be natural, and what the hell did Sara do about it? She comes across as some curious, sexy, dirty, dirty talk, shameless, bitter extortion, know-it-all whore, who apparently sleeps with almost every man she meets! Some of the dialogue she spits would not be out in a porn, and it just works quite unlike the rest of the movie, which plays more like a drama than the scare / thriller it was supposed to be. Then there is the end, if there is a worse way to finish a movie, then just leave literally everything hanging in the air without closing what I have not seen yet. The whole thing was very predictable, but I think someone does not see this by knowing that when they all mention their friend Calef went 'missing', wouldn't there be more to it? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas are making a disturbing movie. In addition to predictability and annoying climax, there is a retrospective story by Alan, which I simply do not understand as he has no more or less importance than anyone else, and at what time does he tell? The reasons for this story have never been clarified or elaborated. There are no tensions, because the whole thing is so by the figures. Technically, the movie is ok, but nothing special, and some of the placements and clothes do not look very authentic to me, it never convinced me it took place in the late 70s. The act was okay & what about actor John Kuntz's surname? I suppose if his wife stood next to him, we could describe them as a couple of Kuntz, right? I really didn't think much of Jon Good's Wife (a blow up doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) & I'm not sure who it would appeal to. Forget about everything, horror, violence, scare, atmosphere or excitement, actually forget everything that would have made this movie visible because it is not here. Not recommended.
