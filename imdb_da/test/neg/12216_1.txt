I booked this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I have heard so much about the TV shows from my friends and virtually everyone in Turkey, I expected to see a breakthrough in the Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I and my husband (admiring a movie with a little Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) saw it all the way through because we had paid $ 20 for DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while others were under-activated. The story was not only confusing, but also adding a gay man who went with his dog to the beach and using some toilet humor in the manuscript to make it "Hollywood" didn't work for me either. <br /> <br /> American characters were almost too stereotypical, not fun or realistic, and as another user mentioned, Turkish customs and lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The camera's movements did not matter. Adding a few dervishes (never seen in those in Kapadokya by the way) and broken sheets -Greek style-only made the movie even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of this movie and all the sound the press has made about it. There are probably worthy films made by Turkish instructors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 out of 10.
