This movie was hard for me to see. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I ever remember in another movie. Most difficult were the gaps in the script / production, where I found myself wondering: "How did they come from there ???" It took almost half of the movie before I could handle the duplication of non-US actors - it was also a distraction. Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy - will there ever be great actors like those in the old study time ??? - This movie helps me understand why actors sometimes "succumb" to their prime.
