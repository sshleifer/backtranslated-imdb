The title is from a passage in the Bible (Deut. 28:28). Let's just say it's been taken horribly out of context - but that's where the title of this disturbing movie comes from. The other reviewers basically cover details so I won't rehash. But the man, who is a psychiatrist, holds a lecture on "inferior function" where he discusses how a person can meet another person, and they can experience a "catastrophic crisis" in their lives where they cease to be masters self and unable to do justice. He says this on the podium at the exact moment when he puts his eyes on Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who becomes his mistress. Not very subtle to show that this really is what will happen to this poor man. I think the whole prerequisite for the movie is unreliable and just didn't work. Here is a psychiatrist who is over, and we must believe that this young beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the joy he and his wife shared. What is even more eerie is how the betrayed wife reacts when she learns about the infidelity. Not only does she understand, but she insists that her husband get started with several months of trampling - "so we can all get some relief from this unbearable stress". Give me a bang !! I wanted to reach through the screen and the throttle not only the fake but the obscure wife. <br /> <br /> The fact that the entire movie takes place as a flashback, after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning (the fact that the man had a terrible accident) - it gives no doubt about the result of the sordid affair. I think it was a bad decision as it certainly doesn't sound like any plot twists to look forward to, as the whole movie is completely predictable. You already know the wife's departure for the affair at the start of the movie, as she calls the mistress to the dying man's bed and expresses no bad will to her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the script defective, but Noel Coward is horribly miscast (though it's his acting). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen at all. Interestingly, Michael Redgrave was originally part of that role, but was replaced during the recording. I wonder what that was about? Eventually neither husband nor wife make you feel sympathetic to one of them. I think Margaret Leighton played some of the socks quite well. But she couldn't overcome all the negatives this movie had. Also, as is the case with many British productions in this era, the dialogue is difficult to understand because of the actors' clipped, fast-paced speech patterns. I saw it on television and couldn't even rely on closed caption to fill in the topics for me. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this.
