If you are a fan of the original series, DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical of the previews when Aeon expresses his motives for murder. In the series, Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventure except for selfish interests. Of course, the responsible chimpanzee felt the film needed to accommodate demographic "bad grrl" by killing the sign but having a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two-dimensional than the comic. The characters are all portrayed as inherent good with a certain conflict of interest, which is eventually solved. All dogs go to heaven, and the same for every person who dies in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, winding, perverted, dominant staff of Aeon and Trevor are not present. Eventually, they literally develop into a sweet couple ala Annie Hall. The only character that was true to the show was the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I suppose if you've ever thought, "I like the Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like any other faceless, vicious sci-fi Hollywood slop out there," then you're in the mood. <br /> <br /> They didn't even get the picture right. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years in the future, it certainly looks like 30 years in the past. Instead of a distinct urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended by a 70's counter-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and lots of plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Talking about Bregna, it's the only city on earth according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, who used to be one. In the film, "Monicans" is just a Hollywood storybook freedom fighters. They also have as much technology as Bregnans, which is not the case from the show. The only possible conclusion is that the real author of this movie was a high school kid and that he wrote it the day before it was due to studio execs, and he has never seen a whole Aeon Flux all the way through. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the comic is confusing. Apart from using certain names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the movie is nothing like the show. The real mass of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots soy-lent green, leaf runs, Logan's races, and grave raids that came out a dull brown root.
