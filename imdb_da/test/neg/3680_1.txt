If they had a zero out of 10, I would come in. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed to take money from the public themselves. I don't know how movies like this are released Video or Pay Channel. I'm disappointed with Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was in it for approx. 8 minutes, so I can't get him so angry. Only the person who noted him to be the star of it. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except Gallo seeks and finds his friend in the catacombs. Why they searched for the gates of hell, only the director knows. They should hold this film in Moscow and burn it to fire to keep all the homeless extra warm at night. There is no more to say about this movie, as all the other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this movie, it hurt my brain.
