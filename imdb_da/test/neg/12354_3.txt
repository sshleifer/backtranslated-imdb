Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin comes to the same studio, of course another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to listen to Chaplin's action after the head of department has hollers, "Next!" Chaplin manages to cross Turpin though. Charlie succeeds in hitting jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, is he able to get a big break, but is a star born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes involving the buttocks. The original slapstick scene from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is the typographer in the long background left on the screen in the film's opening. Agnes Ayres is also shown. <br /> <br /> *** His new job (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
