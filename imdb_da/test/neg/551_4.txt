In 1984, Karate Kid had some charm for it, even though it was a little more than a poor man Rocky. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize that it was best to leave the story when it was completed, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to make the film a trilogy. Part III was the final low in the franchise, but someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation might be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a moment. Next? Yep, Macchio's gone (at least he was clever enough to stop in the end), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Plays a restless teenager (what more?) Named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets problems in school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, one of his students is actually a good guy, and Julie falls for him. This gets her in greater trouble than before, of course. Lucky for her, she is currently living with Mr Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather, knowing how to get back to the evil ones. <br /> <br /> All these factors differ up to seven clich√©s, and it's just a generic plot view - imagine what the detailed scenes should be like! From the beginning to the end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and boring marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Fortunately, Swank has, like Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby, to redeem this disaster, but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and it was quite fun in the sequel, but has nothing to speak for him here - although the revival of "wax on wax" gag is stillborn. As for Ironside, he is a little better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but it is hardly a stretch. So is this picture really so terrible? Not exactly. There is a sequence that manages to achieve a strange beauty, but when the best bit in the whole movie involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, they do not qualify as a recommendation to see the rest .
