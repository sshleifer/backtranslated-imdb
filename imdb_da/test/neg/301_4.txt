*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I've read a bit on Dahmer and experienced the new Dahmer movie (with the same name) at an earlier time. This film here concentrates pretty much on the victims and the killings, too little on Dahmer himself. The movie called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself. <br /> <br /> I didn't find the play to my satisfaction, it also had some amateur experience, especially the test authority. It also seemed as if the Dahmer play became worse every time he played against the probation competitor. But I could be wrong about it. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me was that some of the scenes were rather disturbing, but the filmmakers seemed to try to show "the real deal" what he did anyway. It's okay - but what I don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his apartment while Dahmer was getting beer was not depicted as being naked, as that is how it happened. It is not a big thing, but it only eats the film quality that such details are omitted. What was not shown either or not really hinted at was Dahmer's sexual obsession with the dead. Again I do not mind that they did not show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it into the movie in some way. Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer movie is still being made, a movie that not only includes Dahmer's crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours just isn't enough to understand the complexity of it all. This movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmer's life and personality and does not give you 'close to good' insight into his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
