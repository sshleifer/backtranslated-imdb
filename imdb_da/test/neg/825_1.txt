My God, how bad it is. Who is this cheat pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multilayer satire and humor in his show with down and out toilet humor. This was, of course, an attempt to get him known in the states before publishing his show there on HBO. </ br /> <br /> A commentator here asks us not to judge the movie on the benefits of the show because of the difference in the media. Although it is true that the show's standard format could never be transferred to the big screen, Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the clever use of his comic book in a more conventional movie story. Instead, we have this mess that honestly has nothing to do with Ali G except the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go to the DVDs of Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.
