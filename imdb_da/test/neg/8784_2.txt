Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost blew away from watching and listening to this horrible movie? My eyes almost blew off to see the horrible animation and scary, plotless, empty story. My ears almost blew off listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a choir of hollow monkeys. Then my brain almost melts because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It is formal in every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep up with "dreams come true" schtick? Show a little more faith in the children's intelligence thanks. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
