One would think that anyone who begins a follow-up to the groundbreaking naked official 30 years ago would at least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a kind of biopic of one of the most stylish people in the late 20th century, which in itself has no style at all. True, the filmmakers have gathered some outstanding actors - and handed them a braided mug of killing fluid to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this movie is wrong, starting with the script, which is another of the television movie condensations of great life, where every other line is a "famous quote" of the subject and all other scenes are an in-yours -face introduction to next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR stomach that promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare, editor of a gay journalist who hires Crisp as a film reviewer, gets a bit alienated from him when he doesn't care about the passion of the 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend to the dying okogenic; Jonathan Tucker (in a good performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases witnessed by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade, who, fascinated by Crisp's persona, gives him a place in her busy cabaret action. Nixon is a compelling and gifted performer, but does not get any chance of the script embodying the terrestrial and streetwise arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in an apartment in an old building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned, because "after some years the dust is not getting worse," or something. But look at the depiction of the flat in this movie, you will never get the taste of the dust formation. He visited a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and is seen almost every day of the week, sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this movie we get a dining room that looks like something on 12th Avenue on the Hudson River. Most of the "streets of New York" scenes have a sterile, unreal appearance without the feeling of the period. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years, he can still understand the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across millennia. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes, he even modifies his vocal projection to suit a person's life whose life beats death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this kingdom that when you grow a lot, the very old skin takes on the character of a smelly, non-removable coating, and one longs for death. You feel the feeling in Hurt's performance. So for him and alone, this movie is worth a visit.
