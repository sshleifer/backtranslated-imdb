I do not think this movie had the effect on me that was supposed to: watch American soldiers shoot wounded soldiers from the other side and beat wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them to make them talk made me rot for the other side. It has certainly made the American forces look like "the good people". Was it supposed to be acceptable?
