This was made in the beloved age known as the 80s and shot in my hometown of New York City. in fact, it has become one of my favorite b sci-fi movies. Oh, it really stinks to the big hell, but there is so much to do fun, laugh and enjoy that it becomes more acceptable after every show. <br /> <br /> Like: <br /> <br /> Try to find the similarities between this and ... well, ok, that's nothing as bad as this. Well, except the Castle of FuManchu. <br/> <br /> Socks can be dangerous to your health <br /> <br /> Creating supense by describing through voice over rather than displaying images. <br /> <br /> Having leading scrub "Valeria" (the game wonderfully by Angelika Jager) delivers some of the most riveting lines ever !! <br /> Lots of men and women in post apocalyptic fashion (also leather bikinis, linen dolls and dead animal hair) <br /> <br /> Terrible at the end! <br /> <br /> I'm out to have a salad. Toodles !!
