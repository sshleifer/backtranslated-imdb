This movie with fine production values ​​contains secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very effective, dimly-lit, depressing century piece about a friendship between a poorly ill man and a melancholy, debt-free junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the weeping is thin. Highly recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow paced Merchant Ivory type features. <br /> <br /> I supposed the protagonists were in love, but their connection was so intimate that it did not have the emotional effect of Brokeback Mountain. It has some good writing with a scene that discusses how to disappear in life, but it is really a dark and depressing movie.
