Friz Freleng's 'Snafuperman' is one of the smaller private Snafu shorts. A warning about the importance of studying your field manual, 'Snafuperman' makes it point to quite clumsy. The story where Technical Fairy, First Class makes Snafu superhuman to help him see his road fault is predictable and unfunny. Freleng's former Snafu card 'Rumors' had blown up ideas and laughs, but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic, and he struggles to make an entertaining card from it. Even about three minutes long, 'Snafuperman' seems to be pulling, and unlike the best comics in the series, it feels like an instructional movie first and entertainment else. Even though they were beaten out faster than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu shorts kept a surprisingly high standard. 'Snafuperman' is a reflection of the kind of quality you would reasonably expect from a smaller talent bunch of creative minds.
