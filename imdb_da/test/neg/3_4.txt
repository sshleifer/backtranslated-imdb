Wow, another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even the baseball movie. Seems like he makes movies special to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroines, the mistakes, the grandeur, the fall, the redemption. Yup, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, we must all be horrible over his character and it builds more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... is history? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, even though it had different titles. You know what will happen before it happens. It's like mixing an officer and a gentleman with Backdraft, but both are slightly better movies. See Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how a good but slightly underrated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
