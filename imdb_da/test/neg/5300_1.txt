Uma and Travolta were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the film was nothing but a bunch of very boring and wordy secondary characters wrapped in some extremely bad letters. Occasional glimpses of greatness as the dance scene between Uma and Travolta was quickly eroded when Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting gays came on. And the white guy who tried to act black got VERY, very boring after too much exposure on the picture. He weighed quite a good performance of Rock, the only secondary person you couldn't wait to see leaving the screen. Bad, stupid plot. The authors clearly could not find out whether they wrote to Generation X or the 12-15 year old rap crowd, and the combination turned into a movie that kept me staring at my watch!
