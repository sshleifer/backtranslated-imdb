This movie happened to be on HBO yesterday, so I saw it. This was a mistake. I suppose I was sucked in and watched, even though it was much like a train wreck, terrible, terrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shauden fraud I guess! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on an Caribbean island. One by one they are all murdered. You drink cleaning fluid, you blow up on a waverunner, you go over a rock ... so it's not accidents, but for some reason the police are never called, and no one thinks they might "shoot" and go home not only in respect of the dead, but perhaps out of fear of their own lives. No. They just keep on shooting, because that's the most important thing. Forget the dead models we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the sub-plates is the Evil magazine owner, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspicion, and every time a model is killed, he twirls his mustache and says "well, I can't say it won't be good for the sale". So absurd. Another subplot is when it is revealed that Rex is one of the baby dady models, only when he learned from the child, he tried to convince the girl to interrupt. She did not, but always despised him for suggesting this. <br /> <br /> They are trying to give you false traces and point to a guy named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with accent and "looks scary". At the end (sorry to pamper, but this movie came out many years ago, so if you haven't seen it now ...) one of the women was found down dead in the pool. This was the last straw !!!! Vanessa Angel, forgetting her characters the name comes to Rex with a gun, they are fighting, the gun is burning and now she is also dead! While lying on the floor, his business associate tells him that with all this bad press, the magazine will be worthy of ss and that's all his fault. He makes him write over the magazine to him. When he does voila! All the dead models come back to life, and you find it all was an elaborate ruse to get back to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else said; If you want to see something like this April Fools Day is far better!
