I went out of this movie and I did it only once with the Australian movie Sweetie close to 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt like killing the cameraman and just couldn't believe that this movie actually showed anywhere and guess what - was nominated for two independent Spirit Awards. What???? No matter how realistic the dialogue can be (I will never use the word "guy" again!) - who will listen to these conversations? I'm not going to the cinema to be annoyed, but that's all I have. The only good thing I got away was the realization that if this movie can make it to Sundance and other festivals, anyone can. Well, wait, maybe that's not a good thing.
