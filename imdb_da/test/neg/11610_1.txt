At my local video rental store, they have a special place for two girls and a guy. It's a long running joke really. The clerk lets people rent it for free. They value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money on it. <br /> <br /> I was extremely surprised to see people giving this movie a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Have people involved in the movie written them? Maybe the mother of the director / author?) Maybe I just saw so many good movies that it doesn't fail compared to.
