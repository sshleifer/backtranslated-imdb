Kindred opens up a shot of a Porsche racing along a highway, it picks up an old pickup truck and is stopped. As it goes faster than the pickup, the driver (Benjamin J.Perry as Ben Perry) rides obscenities and bases his horn. Distracted he does not notice an obstruction in front and crashes his Porsche. He is quickly freed from the wreck and taken to hospital. In the way Paramedic (Randy Harrington) is trying to save him, he suggests he probably won't. Then the ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van. The driver of the habit, Jackson (Jim Books as James F.Boeke) raises the Paramedic and steals the patient. The ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber), makes no attempt to stop him. When the injured has been placed in van Jackson, he becomes aware of Harry, who seems to know each other. Harry doesn't ask Jackson to beat him because he broke his jaw last time. Jackson paves Harry on the floor and throws a bunch of money on him. The movie makes it quite clear that we are in San Francisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is awakened by a phone call to her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to state that his mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently had a heart attack, has regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called 'Geneticell Corporation' and welcomes the news and leads her to see her. Once, she asks him to go back to his old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all her notes and experiments, especially the "Anthony Magazines" that Hollins has never heard of, she also claims that he has a brother named Anthony. Back at Geneticell, Hollins speaks to a dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother when they had both worked together before collapsing and asking him about her research, and if he knew of anyone called Anthony. He claims he doesn't know anything. When Amanda dies after a visit from the creepy Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to carry out his mother's request and try to find out who Anthony is. While paying her final respect at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a great admirer of his mother's work and research after she helped her. Because Melissa seems to know so much about his mother's work, he invites her to the house as she may be able to help find answers to various questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, good name, What were her parents thinking!?). They come immediately to business, but find little of interest. For some reason no one at this time thinks to look in the basement, which is as good as there is something down there, something big, slimy and has lots of tentacles. First, Duke kills the dog. Then it goes on to bigger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides to destroy all traces of his mother's work and whatever Anthony is. The collaboration and written by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow also worked Carpenter as a film photographer and Obrow as a producer. This is a pretty bad movie in my opinion. The script is credited to five (!) Authors, Joiner, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano, and with five people working on it, I would like to think that they could come up with something a little better and more coherent than this. Nothing is explained so well, why did Amanda create these monstrous sea creatures / human hybrids? What is Dr. Lloyd's interest and motives? Why does he steal organs from the Ambulance's back? Why does he have a cellar full of mutants? Why doesn't any of these so-called genetic scientists think about controlling the basement? Could Melissa act more suspiciously, even if she tried? Why aren't any characters given any background? Why do people continue to mention a substance found in marine animals called hemocynin when 99.9% of the audience is not going to have any idea what they are about? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all scientists survive in a vomiting inducing mushy "happy ending". This is a horror movie guys, all we want to see are the slimy monsters killing and eating people in different gory ways. The one on-screen death is actually quite cool, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin, in their ear and up their nose in the movies only decent horror sequence. To try out the gore quota, there is a scene where Dr. Lloyd is experimenting on a shiny animal, but it only lasts a few seconds, and in the rest of the movie it doesn't matter. Melissa also becomes a fish, do not ask. There is also no nudity, which is not a surprise. The film looks professional enough with decent production values, but is just as boring and plodded with snail speed. We can't even see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end, which is also far too late when it looks, the effects are ok, and it makes it even more pity that it was not used anymore. Overall I was very disappointed and I expected much better. A horror movie with only one on-screen death and only three in total, what comes the world as well?
