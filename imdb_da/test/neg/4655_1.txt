A Lassie movie that should have been "put to bed" .... FOREVER. That's how I want to describe this painfully boring time-consuming movie. So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a boring, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen. It's not even a performance like a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie. The idea that Lassie is getting bad is exciting, but so little is actually happening, and so slowly you feel your life is slipping away while you are sitting there watching the non-actors reading their lines of cue cards waiting for their tummy pay slips. <br /> <br /> It's a blank hole in a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your or your child's time. Unless you are both highly medical. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will drive you barking sour! Hahahah, get it? BARKING! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I've had a hard week.
