I just got back from "AGS". Having seen it, I am convinced that no matter how much has been written about how he studied the film, Stone has NEVER seen an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The game's montage was hardly visible and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there anything in this movie that was not brought up in the "North Dallas Forty"? Never star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't "get it" .... check. Crazy off-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> It's also the playoffs in Dallas (ie Dec or Jan) in an outdoor stadium, but people sitting there in tank tops and shorts! And what about those lights? Were they in a Japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. It's fourth and 1 in "Sharks" 30. Dallas leads 35-31. KICK FRIGGING FIELD GOAL. Not only would it have been sensible football wise, but you would then have an even better final order where they could have scored and had to go to the top spot conversion. Hell, tie the game with the extra point, and Stone could have made it another 3 hours of overtime. <br /> <br /> Was lame montages of "old time" football players supposedly a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick on. Oops, there's another. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. Long. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Jumps this at any cost. <br /> <br />
