More of a character study then a movie, COMMITTED is yet another relationship with the trimmings specially made for a young audience. The direction seems very basic, with obviously dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the clueless ones. COMMITTED is sometimes visible and there is a little sense of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> The COMMITTED is completely pointless for the first twenty minutes. We get to know Joline, but the movie captures when her husband disappears. Joline settles down to find him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are weird. Other times, the film draws. The second half is more humorous as we see that Joline's spiritual antique takes a trip to the more intense. The annoying guitar music is horrible, but perhaps a necessary evil as COMMITTED still offers very little anyway. An average movie hampered by some effortless moments, COMMITTED's only asset is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
