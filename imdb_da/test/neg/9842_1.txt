This movie is horrible. Not only is the story incredible, the situations in which the characters sit down are so stupid, to the point where it is not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, the star of Broadway's Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career move. The idea is interesting, two young girls age very quickly. But the meat is not even awake. The film is stupid, the story is stupid, the performance is stupid, and the whole concept, while interesting, falls flat. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls come out with guys after having their first time and trying to flush their panties down the toilet. Better Luck next time, boys. My scale * T-scale *
