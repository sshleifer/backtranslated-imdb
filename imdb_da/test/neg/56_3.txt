This show should be titled "When Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors" considering most of the players have shown great talent in other venues, eg. Other Braugher in Murder: Street Life and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious clich√©s and the dialogue so absurd, I wondered how stupid the authors imagined that the core audience should be. We are overwhelmed with the key points of this show rather than being left behind to gradually figure it out, almost as if the authors feel they should spell out that the protagonist is a kind of raising angel condemned to redeem Even from sins, both Venetian and mortal, through bumps in his cab many issues are perished. Seeing the premiere demanded much suspension of disbelief that Mike Olshansky's prizes would so quickly spill their gut, and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of the alien strangers. That he possesses these "super-cop" skills, to be all things to all people, weapons expert, martial arts champion, psychologist, father confessor, locksmith and so on, ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque imagination. What is it about recent televisions based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be steeped in a grim ex-wife and a very disrespectful bratty child? Exaggerated. I wanted to like this show, I really did, because it had the advantage of having a prize slightly different from many of the clones seen in this season's fare, and it is some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid it's just another possibly good idea destroyed by careless execution.
