The first 2/3 of this movie was not the same as the American mummy films from the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to marry the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztecummy whose task it was to protect the sacred treasure and his lady love. And the lady was reincarnated today and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical mummy movie ... even though it's a little slower and shallower than the American versions. Oh, and of course, the Aztec mummy really saw, really crazy. But in this standard but boring movie there is a super-villain. Why? I don't have it - it probably didn't make sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and get her to show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the tax? Well, buying the necessary equipment to make an army of nuclear robots, dummy! But first, he must construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable. You must see these "human robots" as they resemble the huge lumpy robots of Flash Gordon and other series, but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They look really funny fun and see the conclusion when there is a big blow between the bluntly mummy and the straight-forward robot is worth sitting through the rest of the boring movie. Both fight in super-slow motion as they are bathed in taffy ... and it is done in such a fuzzy and stupid way that it is bound to induce chuckles - absolutely not excitement. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is terribly boring and a confused mess - especially at the end. But for bad movie fans, it's a must-see - it's bad, but unintentionally fun and good to see and laugh with friends.
