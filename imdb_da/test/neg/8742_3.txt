Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) is struggling with a very serious illness, and her self-proclaimed inventor Sid (John Tururro) is a little lacking in the emotional department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is good. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; He decides that he will change his name to Franz. Seen in the early 60s, this drama is a bit comical ... change it to zany. UNSTRUNG HEROES is not a MacDowell fan that secures my attitude. although i enjoyed the movie and it is not a total waste.
