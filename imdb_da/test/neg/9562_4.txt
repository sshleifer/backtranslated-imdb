The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eating-dog, where a gangster is killed to show signs of weakness because they become a commitment. I have no problem with the human side of ganster's portrait, but Bugsy manages too far towards soft, comical men. The movie is fun, but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, although exciting, was extremely dangerous and horrible. The play is all good and the direction very solid. The location and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Would Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
