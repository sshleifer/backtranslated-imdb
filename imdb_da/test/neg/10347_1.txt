Hard to believe - but it is! I should not be surprised. Advertisements try to show how unique and "fun" a show can be. Nonetheless, the advertisements announcing this new show have not had the slightest humor for me, I have not spoken to anyone who also found the commercials fun. I don't remember ever seeing a pilot so devoid of wisdom, cuteness or humor. The signs were insufficient for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is amazing, she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this). The few moments when the signs were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim have just a redeeming quality - and that is Selma Blair. Despite wearing contradictory clothes and acting like a pitiful, crazy silly excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to look at. <br /> <br /> But if you want to look at selma, you should hire hellboy. You will at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of cutting this disgraceful character into your brain to connect with her. All in all, Kath and Kim are a waste and really point out the worst thing that TV is or has ever been.
