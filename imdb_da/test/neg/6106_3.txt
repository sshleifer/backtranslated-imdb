My mother told me not to go to see "Kadosh" - but who ever listens to her mother? <br /> <br /> I was so turned off while I watched that I thought I should have lost my feminist credentials on the way to the theater so I checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. No, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement that paints the orthodox as equal to the Taliban. <br /> <br /> While this Israeli film is cautious about showing that the sect's story is about, the ultimate ultra-Orthodox Messianists are so uncomfortable to be incredible (plus the non-fanatic orthodox rock). n'roll (!) one of the sisters is in love with, is incredibly sexy - even in Israel it must be fantasy). <br /> <br /> The theater was pretty crowded so there is a nice curiosity to watch Israeli movies; Too bad this evil movie is the one that gets wide distribution. This was almost enough to drive me back to incredible Hollywood romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/29/2000)
