The four LA police in Fedoras are driving around in a large black convertible look, slightly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the stupid look of the party, is responsible. The author never manages to create a combing spirit among the team members, and the director fails to twist the article out of the mountain Nolte. The question asks someone. Nolte's signs illuminate a cigarette, become sour and turn interviewers into a pulp. His methods nowhere get him until, at some point in the action, he walks from the thrown residence to the thrown residence with his mouth open and his brain closed. He smashes an FBI group and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight, with only a vague report of anger at HQ and no punishment at all. At the end of the film, he is as grimless and muscular as he was from the start. How he managed to make a beautiful whore fall in love with him is a mystery, just as the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his jobless wife. Two interesting shots in the picture: One, of a nuclear explosion, the other of a giant crater, apparently caused by a bomb. It's almost as broken and puffed as Nolte's face.
