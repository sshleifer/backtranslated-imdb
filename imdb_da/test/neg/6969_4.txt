Directed and written by the famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) who plays Glen / Glenda's leading role. This is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; Wood itself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. It occurs miles of stock footage and an incoherent Bela Lugosi used to stretch this odd and awkward movie to 67 minutes. Police inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks information from a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Woods Sister Evelyn. Note: Farrell also works as a narrator. And Fuller later helped write songs included in the Elvis Presley movies BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
