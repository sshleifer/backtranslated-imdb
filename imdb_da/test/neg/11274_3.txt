Thank goodness I have fast forward. I think it's a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Regardless: It's a stupid clich√©. It doesn't make any difference. There is this guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. It does not matter. He's beautiful, this Javier Bardem. So what? I think there is a car wreck, but I quickly saw this, so ... who cares? Car wrecks and beautiful heroes fighting back from them smell like a melodrama to me. Javier likes someone, but he marries Maria de Madeiros instead. She is wonderful, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who for some reason washes her vulva. You'd think Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. No she is not. This is a boring story of a bunch of people who don't interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have a triangle: How boring. This movie is annoying. I think this can be a minor theme of (some) Spanish-language films: The rise and predictable fall for a little guy who succeeds against the odds. Let me just clean up: this is a high class melodrama or maybe soap opera. It's not worth your time, except for a laugh.
