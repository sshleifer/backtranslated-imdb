Laughable would be a good expression for describing this movie. But since this film deserves nothing well said about it, I use the term God-fearing instead. <br /> <br /> Centering on the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the military's disgraceful actions on a half tropical island, the lack of a budget is quickly visible. Michael Pare (a real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads that bunch of fools through a series of monster hunts and gobble-hapless-sacrifice scenes. There is some vague attempt on the pseudoscience to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer as well as the actor does. As if this does not offend the viewer enough, the film also contains what I call "cannons of infinite ammunition". I have never seen Mickey Parrot or his female side-change clip once during the whole movie, but I can report positively that they are hitting at least 40 rounds in each scene where they are going to fire their weapons. Forty rounds may not seem so many, but we speak standard weapons here. I count on 15 round clips, tops. And remember, they never change clips, nor do they seem to carry any extra ammunition. It is stupid as such, sending movies to the celluloid hell's eternal fires, and rightly so. The triple CGI does nothing to help with, and the play is the best laugh, otherwise you start to cry. Why SciFi Channel repeatedly churns out this mush is someone guess. <br /> <br /> My advice .... give this a wide berth ... a very wide berth!
