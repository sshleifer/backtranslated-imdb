And believe me it's a pretty amazing achievement. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove", change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold, and his color comes from green to deep blue. You now have the "Minerals Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was entertaining enough - albeit in such a bad way - to keep an eye on it all the two hours. There is no strip-joint-murder scene or any bizarre killing. I can't tell you how many times I lost interest in the "Miner massacre" and started to cook or clean around the apartment. And the end is completely silly. The 49er guy just randomly comes out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the main actor and actor are sitting in the sheriff's cross, screaming. A really horrible movie.
