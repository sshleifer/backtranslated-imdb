I watched this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie, but then came to know that it is a movie made for TV channel. On my DVD cover out of 2 critics, one critic Stephen Farber from moviline commented on it as a best film of the Year .. All character was simple and decent notions except Brain's character, which never gets reach, which director wanted the mystery to the end .. there was excitement to end, but when you see the end that lady police and starring had a lesbian affair seems to be quite stupid idea. Well know what happens to DAVE the male protagonist. The second critic from Mr. Brown's movie said it was shocking and effective but didn't live up to Hype ... as I watched the movie. For which I was partially aggree ... I should have read this first before you took the film ..
