Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been sadly bored of each of them as soon as I realized they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone else ever noticed that he is never hit? I mean, mess me up ... a tough fight with a bad guy who is scary. Two years and he still films the same fighting scenes. Fighting situations can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The tedious choreography of a Segal film places its painful lack of performance in sharp relief. Even worse, he is violently out of shape. Just what we need, a bold stiff, who thinks he's a leading man. There is no iota to redeem the film value in all these movies ninety or so minutes. DO NOT see this unless you want to throw away an hour and a half.
