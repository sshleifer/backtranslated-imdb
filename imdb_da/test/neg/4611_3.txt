<br /> <br /> I thought this movie lacked the building's dramatic thrill the first movie had. This is hard to achieve when the movie takes place over a week. The original film led to the final climatic event over a period of one year, and it was still less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this movie was that the movie went relatively fast because the plot seemed premature. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. Another reduction was Amy Irving's involvement. All her scenes brought down the movie's pace. The dialogue in this movie was horrible. It in no way reflected the way children talk. In conclusion, this film could be a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.
