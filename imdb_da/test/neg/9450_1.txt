Dreamland started moderately interesting, but never went anywhere except Tedium City. A low-rent affair without name actors and ridiculous effects is not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is that it looks like they really filmed it on the spot in the Nevada desert. That's what I can't think of one thing well beyond that if it stinks. The final must be a kind of revelation, but fall flat like the rest. Oh, I was thinking of another good point about this cheese, it beats in just over an hour, even though it still carries its welcome long before then. When the girl starts walking around in the desert at night, it seems to be forever and just gets worse from there. The trials against horror are not effective at least. The story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly. Check out "Retroactive" for a good science fiction B movie.
