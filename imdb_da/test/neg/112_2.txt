Now I love Italian horror movies. The cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not cheesy Italian. This is dishonest spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. It is amateur hour at each level. There is no excitement, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered to remind you that you are actually watching a horror movie. "Special effects" consist of the lights switching to red when the ghost (or whatever it is) is around, and a string pulls the sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The DVD quality is the one for a VHS transfer (which actually helps the movie more than hurts). The headline is below even the lowest "bad Italian movie" standards, and I gave it a star just because the dialogue is so much fun! And what do we discover when she finally looks at the ceiling (in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next) ... well, I won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say that not very "novel"!
