I only saw the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally I think this is the worst movie to be made in recent years. The plot was so bad that it could have been possible that a 10 year old child wrote it. The action was also sloppy with virtually an unknown caste and not only that the action sequences especially in the first half of the film were so horrible, it was incredible. I don't know how the producers got the budget to film this movie, but the production company has to regret it now. <br /> <br /> For anyone who can cross this movie in the near future, I advise you to remove this ghost of a movie.
