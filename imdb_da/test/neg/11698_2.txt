This movie strayed too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely made it to the middle of the movie. Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards's nephew to his son, most of the big scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life removed. What was left was the trash can. Straub's version was far better than this poorly executed movie. I don't think casting did all that was a great job of choosing the Chowder Society members either. Hopefully someone will come together and actually replay this movie correctly in my lifetime. I just hate when Hollywood beats talented writers' works because they think their version is so much better. Make me sick.
