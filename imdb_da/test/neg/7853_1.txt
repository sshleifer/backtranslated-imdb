I fail to see how anyone who actually read the M. Didius Falco mysteries could make such a fun of them. An Aussie has no business in ancient Rome. None of the books are in this movie except the setting and the characters, and they are wasted on a plot that is thin enough to read the stupid script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerve to show their names in the credits.
