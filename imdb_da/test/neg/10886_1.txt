I can't say anything simpler than that, it's a horrible movie. I have worked in the industry and made several (short) movies myself, so okay, my standard is quite high, but seriously, I absolutely hate this movie. I haven't commented on IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to come and warn others. It's a piece of sh * t. The author / director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make / write a good movie and have a teen's teen writing skills. The characters are unrealistic (The main woman does not think about taking the police gun yet, but is ingenious enough to improvise a Molotov cocktail?) And not even sympathetic, hell I hated her and cheered when she died. I don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it just looked blunt writing and practical bullsh * t without any real thinking behind me. This is officially the worst movie I've seen all year. Congratulations Shiban, you now stand up with such greats as Micheal Bay in the prestigious "shouldn't be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a movie" club. I hope you read this, I really do. And to the 163 idiots who rated this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh Oh my god, I hope a redneck demon works comfortably behind you and tortures you.
