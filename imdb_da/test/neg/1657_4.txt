Very slow, boring, enigmatic movie. Much like that movie, Jean-Luc Godard would have done, he had been Italian. Certainly conveys how boring, repetitive, joyful and even a person's life can be, but I usually do not go to the cinema to find out! The reason (as it is) does not convince. Why a beautiful hotel receptionist (an exception to the movie's stupidity) would be the least bit interested in a moody, chain-smoker, quiet loner who speaks in 'deep' theories, baffles me. Very hard to feel any sympathy with the main character. You want to shake him by the neck and tell him to "snap it out!" His brother is a much more human character. The end is inconceivable and puzzling. Everyone in the cinema (when I saw the movie) went out and muttered about how they almost fell asleep. Of course it should not be a Hollywood Bruce Willis-style 'shhot-em-up' and 'crash-bang' fiesta, but a little energy and action would have made it much more exciting. One of the best Italian movies ever?! Pleease ... An art house, curiosity at best.
