The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILS OF THE BOOK AND THE MOVIA !!! <br /> <br /> If you've never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, the source material for Man Hunt, you'll probably enjoy Fritz Lang's treatment of the story. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and have practically remembered the book, the movie will be a crashing disappointment. I assume you have already read an overview of the story and continue to my complaints. The household's little novel is one of the all-time great excitement classics, tight and frugal, with only a handful of signs to evoke the action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy, the latter reducing the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the manuscript where the novel did not need anyone. In fact, the book's true climax was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground lair, but rather his self-evident acceptance of his true motive to go on his quest in the first place. And that's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all the way through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can't Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did they take out of? Which brings me to my bitter complaint: The house hunter is so quintessentially British, he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can hardly maintain the accent, which is only a little deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costner is in Robin Hood. He looked straight into the role, and was a fine actor for the 1940s, but as Rogue Male's reluctant hero? Let's look at Sceptered Isle even for a more compelling version. Remake soon with subtlety and with, thank you! I head it for free ??
