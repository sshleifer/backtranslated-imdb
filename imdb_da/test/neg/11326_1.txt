Many years ago I used to see bad movies on purpose. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings true. No facial expression fits the scene or action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. On the last scene, I dared to drive the car over the ridiculous child - one of the worst child actors ever. Just a name in what I've ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, SEE THIS MOVIE !!! You have been warned !!!
