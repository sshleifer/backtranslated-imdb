Not to be confused as the heavily spied on Samuel L. Jackson's SNAKES ON A PLANE vehicle; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is low budget, has no players (to talk about), but some fairly decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry any year's choice for her husband; So she is put under a powerful Mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. Her only hope for survival is a shaman living across the border in Texas. Time runs out to her; and she is on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Before long, the tubes leave their pain-disrupted body and grow rapidly in size. The passengers on board the train are now caught and soon to be snacks for the snakes. The final sequence is undoubtedly the best of this 91 minute flick. Also receiving credit are: Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
