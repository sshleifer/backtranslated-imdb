All I could think of while watching this movie was "Will it ever end?" It was tirelessly boring to see. I wish I could just turn it off, but I would like to do this review justice so I fought for the good fight and resisted the torture to see this movie all the way so you, the good reader, don't have to bear the pain too . <br /> <br /> This movie sounds like it has a good premise if you read the premise on paper. However, the actual movie does not deliver on this performance. <br /> <br /> The opening scene has a mineshaft in the early 1900s, forcing children to carry dynamite in the tunnels that are not big enough for the adults to fit in. be a prerequisite for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes it becomes clear that this is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes are never punished; There are no consequences in the movie for their actions. The opening scene is far better than, and completely irrelevant to, the rest of the movie. The last time an opening scene confused a movie so violently, the opening scene was 28 days later, which was the only good scene in the whole movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to pamper it is crappiness and sell it again) is exactly the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only visible scene in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie flashes until the present. Single mother and her two bratty, foul-mouthed children. Right here is when it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go close to the movie again. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, the zombie kids are barely seen. They might get 3 minutes of screen time, total. All they do is kill a pig, that's it. The rest of the hour is used to show the stupid mother and her stupid children to buy things at the local store, walk around the woods and have in-house conversations with each other. The stupid teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes grass with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no need to worry at all if the zombie kids sent anyone in this movie. Every single character is both stupid and annoying, with no redeeming qualities at all. Not to mention one-dimensional and clichéd. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been * greatly improved * if the mother and her stupid children were shipped in the first 10 minutes of the zombie kids as they drove up to their new house, so credits ended rolling. The right thing that would immediately change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Frankly speaking! When the stupid mother takes her eyes off the road and almost walks into a pedestrian on the road, she scolds her daughter: "You almost killed us, mother!" Of course, anyone who has a common sense knows that if the mother had hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead --- not the people safely encapsulated * inside the * car. I suppose this line was inserted into the movie to show firsthand that the protagonists' complete stupidity knows no boundaries and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it felt like 5 hours or more for me. Trying to not fall asleep was a huge challenge. It is only until over an hour has gone into 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually recover to kill any person. Then the scene shows the stupid teenagers who drink beer and make out in a car and say lines like, "If you ever want to get in my pants again, start the car better and get my ass out here right now." Seriously, it is magnificent from the movie. Teenagers are so clichéd, one-dimensional, poorly acted, stupid and annoying that when the zombie kids finally come around to hack 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes in the movie, it feels like a cause of celebration. Of course, the "princess" stupid, weedless, foul-mouthed beer-drinker loses the daughter of the main carnage away from scott-free. What a buzzkill there was! She was on the screen longer than the others and thus the most annoying of the 4 of them, and most deserve a pickaxe to the head. The more reason she should have been shipped within the first 10 minutes, as mentioned above. To keep her around for 1 hour and 5 minutes, it is completely inexplicable. The reason for this is of course that film length films must be padded for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So by keeping her alive long past when she should be, they have an extra 27 minutes to film the movie with her and her mother runs through the woods. At 1 hour and 22 minutes in, it's * second * time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine doesn't start while the zombie kids come to get her. <br /> <br /> The zombie kids are quite generic. Never say anything. No character development whatsoever for any of them. In the end, all 3 of the annoying, idiotic protagonists live. Which, in my opinion, is the way the filmmakers give a final turn on the bird movement to the viewers. In my opinion, the filmmakers know for sure that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the big accident watching the whole movie. Why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been shipped within the first 10 minutes die. <br /> <br /> Avoid evil little things / zombies like the Bubonic plague.
