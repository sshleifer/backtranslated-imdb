Miles O'keefe stars like Ator, a linen dressed entirely resembling a Chippendale dancer. Conan-wannabe must fight with a vicious guy in a Cher wig and protect Earth from the Geometric Nucleus, a kind of primitive atomic bomb. Beware of visible sunglasses and covers. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 got the fun of it under the title CAVE DWELLERS.
