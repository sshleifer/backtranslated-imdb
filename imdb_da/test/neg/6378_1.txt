Comedy works best when it comes to things that are true. But even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes, and even the most grumpy viewers can crack a smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole "it's fun because it's true" thing, but I don't see the effort, and often I don't do it if they're funny or just trying to make a point (I notice this mostly in the interview segments). The Daily Show started as a news parade. They adorn the fun of how the media play their own news by pretending to be outrageous and stupid news reporters and anchors, and they tackled many subjects from science to film and sometimes politics, so Jon Stewart came together ... and it all went to hell. Thr the first year of Jon Stewart's government was certainly gold, though he was so funny, but then came together in 2004 and this is where you start to see a great chance in the show from there. The show's humor has become obsolete, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the show's best anchors back, and now it's mostly about Jon Stewart and the show has gone from a parody to a half-serious news show, mostly Evening News, but with some gags here and there. For those who have not seen the show and have trouble finding out what to look at the cable, I give you a brief description of what the performance is about (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans ( unless they are embracing an opinion that also shares democrats) are stupid, evil, corrupt, and the hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and hypocritical; - people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; - Democrat There I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go see something else. First, although the producers hijacked the show on their own personal political agenda, but when I actually see interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show is about (what I mentioned above), but I come to it in a moment. Deadline, expect humor in The Daily Show, according to Jon Stewart, that you find a randomly filmed quote, said by either Bush, Cheney or a random republican humorous, because good because. Jon puts the joke up and puts it in the authors' specific context and expects the random quote to somehow deliver the stroke line. So unless you "get" the context, it is completely useless as bankable humor. Also, the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of a politician who speaks and in another separate video says another thing and again puts in a context that the authors expect you to understand and thus makes fun , Why? Well, because Jon said so. Now imagine the Daily Show using this formula countless times this year every week, and you will begin to understand what used to be a laughter party, now 25 minutes of just quiet posts (yes even in the Lewis Black segments) . In the beginning, a decent effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of it is clear. And the interview has the most strange sense of bias I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bullying, but what makes him do it when he sucks up every actor and democrat (John Kerry before, Obama today) who appears on the show and looks down on respected Republicans and conservatives news like weekly standard s own Bill Kristol? He puts them in a kind of people's tribunal as if they are being charged with a crime, often every person on the show standing up for Bush is portrayed as a misconception as if the person is out of touch with reality and assumes he is speaking For most of America, it is de facto treatment for any conservative unless they happen to share a similar view with Democrats, if so, it is an infinite love party. But it doesn't matter, in Jon's eyes you are already wrong before entering the show and still being wrong by word. It is the kind of treatment you get if you are something far right. Now you have to wonder what could have something to do with humor. One wonders what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
