If it wasn't for the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn starring, I would have turned off "Milo" after the first 30 minutes. But just as easy in the eyes as she is, she is not enough to save this movie, not with a long shot. <br /> <br /> Milo starts with a group of young girls accompanying an "assumed young boy" in a yellow slicker for a house in the woods, showing them embryos in jars. Apparently, the deal was that if he showed them the jars, ol 'Milo got a gynecological exam on each in return. One of the group's volunteers is Milo's "first patient" and he is leading her behind closed doors. Immediately later, the blood flows from under the door and we are whisked to the present day. Enter the lovely Jostyn, who plays one of the girls, all grown up in the present. A substitute teacher with low trust, whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish, receives an invitation to return to a friend's wedding. Yep! You guessed it. Back to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned a year ago, seems to have a dilemma that stays dead and begins to terrorize and murder the girls, which he failed to "examine" all these years ago. <br /> <br /> Milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants of Cronenberg's "The Brood." He could have been scary, but just as scary can a villain be wearing a yellow raincoat? The reason confuses itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back. I send Milo, an unfortunate slasher movie, to stand in the corner!
