I had great expectations about this movie (not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1/2, but high enough), and when I saw it on cable, they were all crushed. Beginning to trade (poor, almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: Since when does a 5-man squad walk on a presumably "hot" zone ??? For suicide ?? Being a big mistake, it costs the film deeply. Very good actors make it very bad, like Sean Penn, who recently repeated the annoying way of talking about "I'm Sam" and Michael J. Fox, wasting a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen on "Platoon" "average" . But the most annoying character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another silly waste of fine talent from the director), it was a cheesy, frightened and insecure person, even more annoying that Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard it). The fighting sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet on a VC tunnel. de Palma has a weak work here, and if it were not for films like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables" (these excellent films), I would consider him a "bluff" director: too much advertising, poor filming. <br /> <br /> 3/10
