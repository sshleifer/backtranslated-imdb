I was looking forward to seeing this at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the final credit because I could no longer sit through it. It was badly shot, the sound sucked, and the play was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this movie has not been able to find a US distribution company to release it in the United States. This screams of a low budget high school production.
