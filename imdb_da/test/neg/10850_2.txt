Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotions and powerful, memorable music. The Maestro must have rolled in his grave, as this bawdy travesty of his work was released with his unnecessary frontal nudity and cheap copuling and its depiction of naive but basically Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera can certainly be adapted to cinema --- look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata --- but when a work is as amazing as Rigoletto, it doesn't need cheap gimmicks. It could even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good, but it is a mediocre representation of the libretto with second rate sound quality on it.
