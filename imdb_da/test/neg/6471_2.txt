I really enjoyed the first movie and when it came up again without thinking or checking out, I took a family of friends to see it. I was ashamed that I was very excited about it. <br /> <br /> Disney treated the original movie, just as the human body treats a delicious meal - takes something good and turns out ... well you know well. And by having a dark-skinned person as an FBI man, the results of fingerprinting the informant were suppressed. <br /> <br /> As an isolated film, I assume it is not so bad if you like the strange kind of thing, but when you have read the book or seen the first movie - horrible!
