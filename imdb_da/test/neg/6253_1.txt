I saw this on the shelves at the rental site and I have rented everything else so I said why not. Why not because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like it was shot with home camera. I guess it would all allow the budget. There were less breasts in it than I thought it would be. Some people made it to be soft porn with a few kills. The funniest part of the whole movie for me is in the extra things. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there is only one, but it's the stupid one and I think it may have brought the rest of the movie down. The girls come in a whirlpool and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes it ends up with all of them. Good cases !!! This movie is very very bad. Do not want to.
