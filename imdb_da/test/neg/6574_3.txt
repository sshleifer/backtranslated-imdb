I assume that after Leonard Nimoy had succeeded in managing "Search for Spock" and "Voyage Home", William Shatner believed he could also lead. Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he is just not a good instructor. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is hard evidence to support Trekkie's arguments, which say that William Shatner is an arrogant ego-man. For even though his character, Captain James Kirk, was always the most important role in the original "Star Trek", in this movie he seems to be the heart of the movie, the other two main characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy are just there. to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The reason is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is the mindset with people and releases the pain bottle inside them from the traumatic event early in life, which changed them forever. Grateful, they go with him in his quest to free the world from pain and thus to peace. Sybok and his followers bid on the building, where a peace conference takes place between a human, klingon and a Roman diplomat. This lures the ever-growing enterprise there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with how Starfleet runs, Klingons and Romulans should have won them years ago). Sybok adds the company crew, save Spock (which is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Diary imposes on the company to go out to the "center of the universe" to meet "God" who apparently has every race for a word. It turns out, however, that this is only a minor entity when he requires the use of Enterprise and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a constellation." The device is destroyed, but not before Sybok, who is aware that he has been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after Enterprise Photon Torpedos destroys the entity and inexplicable Sybok. <br /> <br /> OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point rationality must be enforced. Why Do People Follow a Book Only to Release Their Pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I have certainly led to a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try his crew member for myth and betrayal after joining the Diary? What was the purpose of the Diary to sacrifice himself when the torpedoes would kill the unit anyway? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, but played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan, doesn't mean he has to act exactly like a human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was co-author and director) could at least have developed the dialogue into an emotional Vulcan. I think he feels that every emotional being speaks like us. Gee, I suppose Klingons should say "not" and "not" more often than "not" and "not". And the Cardassians should not prolong their sentences because they like to speak (yes, I know it is boring that I know). Please ... every ST race uses unique dialogue. Why is the Sybok the exception. <br /> <br /> All that's not to complain about is acting. I have always known "Star Trek" for having good actors, and this movie is not an exception. Cudos also goes to Leonard Nimoy because it should be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock at his age. <br /> <br /> Some other things I didn't like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and The late DeForrest Kelly show twice what bad singers they are singing "Row, Row, Row your Boat "in this movie. I think Shatner wanted to silence his worshipers of his song-friend. What he did was prove their point. <br /> <br /> Uhura makes a fan dance while not carrying anything other than wooden bark to draw some men into a booby trap. After all, the dreams of all of us men are filled with pictures of middle-aged, plump women who dance naked. Comedy is all good and good, as long as it doesn't affect the character of "Star Trek" too much, but when Scotty encounters an object on Enterprise and KO itself, it's just gone overboard. Kirk is the only crew member who can reject Sybog's offer to release their inner pain and look through God rejecting his deception. Not even Spock can handle any of these? Perhaps these scenes were valentines from Shatner to his character as many suspects. The concept of a device that makes up God had been used in "Star Trek" before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> In view of uncreativeness, I did not completely tear out the music in "Star Trek: The Next Generation." All in All, pretty bad "Trek" movies. If you are a Trekkie, take it once, because it is "Star Trek." Otherwise, see "Star Trek II: Khan's Peace". It's far better.
