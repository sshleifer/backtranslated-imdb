If rich people are different from us because they have more money, then filmmakers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought. This self-sufficient piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie and someone would fund it. Not all trivial ideas or reflections are worthy of a movie (unless you are a college movie student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, it is sometimes best to stay calm. <br /> <br /> The picture is not breathing. They are quite common. The dialogue is inane and incredible. They speak words, no one wants each sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination. Germaine Greer's zipless f ** k is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one in bed falls as easily as these signs. They screw before they speak. Even more incredible is an aging balding director who instantly finds sex with the most beautiful chicken in town, even though gravity is already coming to Miss Marceau in youthful age.
