Calling this movie a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is too optimistic. Heck, you can't even refer to it as a good spoof of the genre because it's far below average (it's fun but not "haha-funny, you know it)." But I still want to say that. Only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it. By the way, all the people who complain about this movie here in their comments only blame themselves. When you watch the DVD cover on this movie, you should already know that it's not going to be the same level as "The Piano" for example, so don't come to complain afterwards ... Evil Ed could have been something but It was completely turned up. I assume that the main idea behind this movie is criticism of the growing "cutting committee" in horror today. It shows an editor named Edward who slowly (not too slowly) walks on nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the films produced by his company produced. The big boss is called Sam Campbell ... Funny, isn't it? Personally, I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi, but to my surprise there was not. Anyway, this guy got rich by making movies called "Loose Limbs". They have (and I'm not typing you!) Scenes where a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) And then shot in the head by a bazooka !!! Now who says horror is not original anymore? <br /> <br /> With all the gears and the 'loose limbs', it's hard to believe it, but it gets really boring very quickly. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed becomes completely bored and never discovers it. The only thought left to do (besides pushing the eject button, of course) is looking for the obvious amount of references to other, much better horror movies. I saw scenes obviously stolen from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and several others. And there are a lot of classic horror posters on the walls to admire too. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed finds it originating in sweden. I am convinced that there is a lot of talent there, far north (take the Danish "Night Watch" as an example) ... but none of their talents joined the Evil Ed's play or crew. Only to see if you are in a stupid mood, and you will not use your brain at all.
