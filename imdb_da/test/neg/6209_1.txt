There was not a 0 in the poll option, so I was forced to use the next available figure. It's a sad day for Bollywood, when such a movie that has star actors is nothing more than a bunch of youth actors, and a horrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is not near being called a clone of Hitch. Salman Khan with his usual take-off you shirt theme and Govinda with his in-humor laugh. If anyone had told 2 years ago that I would comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written him / her away.
