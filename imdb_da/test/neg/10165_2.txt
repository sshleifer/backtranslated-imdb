Seeing this movie today I got the feeling that this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides on this trading post / salon in the middle of the sky to meet the owner for some robberies. All he sees are signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no living in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English secret secrets. The reason you find the hidden rooms in these kinds of stories is that they were pastor holes in the past. Catholic families clinging to the ancient faith of the 16th century have built these things to hide those who are fleeing from royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick. Unfortunately, due to poor editing or writing or both, we never know exactly what led Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B-West and not even a good one to it. Gabby Hayes is in this, and he is clean shaven and plays a dumb part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the ugly Gabby. <br /> <br /> If you want to disturb and find out what's going on and see a whiskerless Gabby Hayes then watch this movie.
