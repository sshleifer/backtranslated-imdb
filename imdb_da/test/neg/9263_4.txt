This movie is a great bore. It has a lot of predictable plot and endless feelings from the start. It starts well with a classic number, but seems lost midway. <br /> <br /> Surya & Jyothika are on the screen chemistry works really well and a good deal of Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? He disappears completely after a good half hour! Santhanam proves its gentle again by timing comedy. <br /> <br /> AR's tunes will definitely last for some time. But he could have done better. What is ever the downside is worth seeing once if you feel at home alone or looking for a good time.
