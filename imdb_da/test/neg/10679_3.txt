Like the whole role and crew, f *** knows everything about film production. <br /> <br /> This movie relates to the adventures and predicaments of a modern cockney vampire killer and an age old spit with his seemingly throwing vampire lover. It's all about clich√©s and promises of boredom when they just scaled a movie like this, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I do not reject films because they are B-movies, in fact some of my favorite films are B-films like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but the one misses marked by a kilometer. Anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the play is rarely gripping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on the screen. Some of the so-called actors are just indescribably bad, with characters spitting cheesy a lines that fall flat and discourse expresses so many emotions and convictions as the terminator after a few horse's sedatives. <br /> <br /> A great part of the movie is also recorded by the vampire characters, especially the protagonist, unnecessarily flapping their mouths and showing their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It should literally happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if many people look out of laxly allegedly scary vampire faces were used to just fill up some time and brush out the rest of this tooth sandwich in a movie. Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe in here, I feel this movie (especially the director) is really trying to take this movie seriously in many parts. The large number of overly dramatic action images and extreme close-ups seem to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this movie and make it legitimate for his genre and not spoof it, and unfortunately he fails. The experiments on supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comics and stupid, and the action sequences are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> Also, the end of this movie was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have ever seen for a movie, B-movie or not. When movies like this force you to sit for hours by themselves to be rewarded with a "Oh that was all a game," it actually ends illnesses. The conclusion of the "plot" feels like a reflection from the director that he figured out on the last shooting day because they had run to the end of their shoestring budget. <br /> <br /> However, I haven't rated this movie as a star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and that's because of the only plus I can really give this movie. Intentionally or not, it was fun. I'm pretty sure the parts I found humorous were not meant to be, and I found most of the real gags efforts to be fruitless, but when seen with friends, it's a good movie to take mickey out of.
