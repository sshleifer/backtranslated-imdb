Why do you ask this man to have the truth behind the almighty existence? Now its deductive logic is my friends, you see I know that God exists because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes become dirty on such a horrible movie? Yes, there is no doubt about it, on a cold Friday in 2006, Satan had me and forced me to watch this movie. He what? You wonder; The devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climbed ceilings, why would he waste his time to get you to watch this movie? My only conclusion to this query is that Satan thinks that Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, does not deepen your eyes or makes you speak in tongues, but makes you sidelined for an hour and a half by the most horrible movie ever made. Can this movie be as horrible as he says? Yes, my friend who watches this movie is like being kicked in the bag about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too hard, this movie has a few moments in it, for example, the beginning begins in a sorority house with many topless girls; Now I am never in a sorrow, I am unsure whether girls really do this, but hi, you can always pray. Now that the five minutes of breasts and buttocks have been completed, we are presented with a stage on campus at a girls' college; The girls themselves (about eight in total) are in an archaeological class where they discuss godly and old hills. Blink-forward professor of the class (who apparently is the only man in this college of girls apparently) takes a handful of his nubile students, plus boyfriend, to a distant lake in the mountains, their missions to find ancient Indian artifacts; yes really professor, we know what angle your pitching. Now this is where the movie starts, the group of five, four girls, a guy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but watch and see a biker once pulls up and harasses the girls, leaving only them alone and go their own ways. They move to a "campsite" consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go terribly wrong. First, prof. And his girlfriend walk around to get a little alone when one of the girls takes it upon themselves to find them, only to be caught by some unknown force. Continue on the other two girls starting to look for the missing girl when the cyclists, plus a drunk guy, are looking for them, their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things for them. The film continues with something about a druid who needs four virgins for a victim to save the world from a kind of water sample before the year 2000; but their is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid, one of the girls is confused just before us, so gone that plan. Now since I said there would be spoilers, I would go ahead and destroy the end of the movie for you, the four girls being taken, drugged with some green goo and then ready to be sacrificed after one of them killed them two remaining cyclists and prof. came to rescue them; they are standing on an edge where the non-leading biker says, "I think I can do it down there!" only to jump down and break his leg. Prof. driving on the lighthouse and being subdued, leaving only the once raped-now-heroic biker back to avert the 6'3 "giant druid. gold snake mouth and light the grape on fire immediately afterwards, they transport the wounded away via emergency cutter and consider whether everything is really over, only to get the sea bum to show the monster within what it is still living. which, unfortunately, will be unread by most eyes, as this is only the fifth book-reported review of a movie that has been out for fifteen years. Fortunately, Satan can only come to some of us and not everyone. excuse for the poor girl at Circuit City, I will lend this movie: "I'm sorry Sheila, please don't hate me to let you see this."
