I debated a bit about what was giving this, because it's my least favorite Herschell Gordon Lewis movie so far other than The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best actor I've seen in a Lewis movie. But we all know it doesn't say much. When the movie was finished, I was happy because it felt like I had been through a 4-hour movie, even though it was only 82 minutes long. I'm trying to see all HGL's movies and that's probably the only reason to see this. <br /> <br /> Gore is good as usual, the only thing that Herschell seemed to be right. The action is just as bad as usual with an exception. The exception is Frank Kress. Now I want to say he's a good actor? No way, but he is good compared to everyone else. The story is boring and flat and doesn't go where and in the end I didn't care what happened as long as it ended. I know this is a cult classic, but I haven't had much at all. I hope you will.
