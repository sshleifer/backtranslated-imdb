Oh, such an original title for a very shoddy movie. The headline is hilarious, since voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on when I saw this mess. There are flashbacks in flashbacks and no real time takes place until the end. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I washed it twice and got the best ab training ever. The singing Aztec lady is cartoon naturale and the dance and costumes is a hoot. Some guy gets a face filled with acid, there are many battles, you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared), and it's a whole noir mess. Oh, and the real fight does not happen for a while, so during the film you are welcome to get up, take a nap, take a walk. You will not miss anything exciting.
