While I watched this movie, I never thought I'd defend it. It is frankly enough from the beginning not to have much of a plot. There are no real signs to unlock except the killer. Some of the actors may be better, but most are capable. <br /> <br /> I know three out of ten aren't star, but there are reviews that say it was shot badly and completely useless, etc. I think it should do what it should be pretty good. The lighting is sometimes minimal, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it should look like camera snuff film. In fact, the quality is probably too high to be true to it at times, but no one would do it through a minute of camera work that is really that bad. It's not very scary, but it is disturbing at times. There are one or two characters that are not at all convincingly credible, and the soundtrack often becomes tedious, but overall it was cleaner than many camcorders.
