Okay, some other people have commented that this is not an action girl, so I don't have to rehash it (even though I just did it). This is not exactly a disappointment, in fact it is nice to see an actor try something else. But unfortunately this is not one of those apartments. <br /> <br /> Now the story is: non-existent. This movie is missing in storyline almost as much as 'Showgirls' did. Well, they throw in a couple of environmentalists, no, not even environmentalist, anything else, treats here and there to please Seagal (that's what he is in). This doesn't make a story, not even close. Now, the end ... Even those of us who actually liked this movie ... the end, you must admit that it was a little or very stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, from what I understand this was a direct-to-video movie (at least in the states), but it's too good for it. This waste should only have been cable, at TBS or Starz (late evening).
