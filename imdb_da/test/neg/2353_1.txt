Hitchcock is a great instructor. Ironically, I mostly find his movie a total waste of time to watch. I admire Hitchcok at a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First, positive. Hitchcock invented the idea of ​​probing the camera. The curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information. It is not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary then. <br /> <br /> Second, the perfect Hitchcock is mostly thriller and chase movie. He has an economic style and always thinks about the audience. He gives them regular excitement, regular mood and regular shock. In short, he expects the public's basic needs and plays them as a fiddle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a person's basic needs are mostly stupid. Food, sex, the thrill of danger and a little comedy. Hithcock caters to all these needs on the screen, with the exception of food that, by its size, has taken into account offscreen. It is this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films. Another drawback is that most of Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now commonplace. What keeps his movie visible is his simple economy, the intelligence of his camera work, and his ability to make excited action-set pieces. <br /> <br /> Continue to "Saboteur". This is a bright heart in the way of "The 39 Steps". It jumps from order to sequence until it finishes with the typical Hitchcock endbook set. <br /> <br /> On an emotional level, the relationship between the leaders is not entirely up to Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "The 39 Steps". Therefore, the whole story lacks some energy. The plot simply contains a machine, desperate depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us closer to the end, as it is not clear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the bad guys or his action to stop the plagued sabotage. <br /> <br /> There is the usual Hitchcock logic error. A guy with a handcuff releases himself using a car belt belt, etc. (Why doesn't he just drive in the car? Certainly handcuffs are not so restrictive? He is able to swim in them!) <Br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock war time propaganda flip from the 40s, I recommend you see "Foreign Correspondant". They are both stupid chase movies with a catchy final, but "Foreign Correspondant" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something Spielberg slides fine in "Minority Report". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Some good sets. In addition, there is not much to sink your teeth into.
