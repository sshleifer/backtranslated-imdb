"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "The Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere terribly dull and overwhelmingly painful to see. As a historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich story ... but it really is no more than just another cheap 70's action girl with a historical story and an eye-catching sporty Sonny Chiba. Before this movie was halfway, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in the warmth of your ears to a melody composed by Ennio Morricone (this is not an insult to Morricone). The use of zoom lens film is more nauseating than fascinating. And as for action, it's really no more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shock. What a horrible movie.
