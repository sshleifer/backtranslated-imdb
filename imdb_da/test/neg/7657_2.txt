This movie has more goofs than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are damn awful. For example, near the end when Concorde falls after the cargo door tears, the case spins like a toy. Special effects of Airport (1970) are far better than this crap. A power from a Concorde that opens up at height and speed would essentially do things inside. (That's if it even opened up) But the movie has its good points. Mostly when it ends. It's also cheesy. Eg. Thingen lands on a bank with loosely filled snow, if it did, it would splinter into a million pieces. Total 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Nice grin.
