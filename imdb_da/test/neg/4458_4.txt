Being too young to have experienced the Hammer movies, when they were fresh and new, I discover their sacred horror film, which I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the magic of the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry to the Christopher Lee series. The original Hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a great story to get involved in. Lee was a great Dracula, a vampire, if possible, in the early excursion, but here he is nothing but a cardboard character for which most of it stands around and looks threatening. The brave young people speak like cartoon characters (although my aunt lived in England in the 1970s and she says people actually spoke to the awful clich√©s). I had no interest in who lived or died among the younger crowds. They were all quite terrible signs anyway. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but she leaves the story too early. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing adds an air of authenticity to the movie, but they can't draw blood from this blank movie. It is D.O.A.
