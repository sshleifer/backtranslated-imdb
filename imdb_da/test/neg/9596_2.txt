Book Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people meet with a little money, some knowledge of film making, a mixed bag of hopeful actors and a lot of determination, but all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull out more than a pretty bad look after school special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I think this is so-so quality home movie / student movie stuff if you want to send it around to family and friends for free. Luckily I found it in a discount container somewhere. Sure there can be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing, but it is a market that apparently only exists by default because there are so many poor B movies out there. Even more so today and age. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would recommend this step to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. First, I recommend that they look at the special feature that does things that are included on the disk. See the film crew's enthusiasm, their hard work, joy and very high opinions about their own product. Then watch the movie. Within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through it all and clearly tried the instructor and the filmmaker, but just don't know enough about what they're doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run without the necessary skills, this interprets: They knew enough to be dangerous. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie (which apposed to a more decent one I guess). A few actors made it okay, and the victorious stoner sees the guy with the tattoo (real or false tattoo I don't know) was probably the best and most natural, and I hope he does. But their naturally functioning talent was what came through despite the bad movie, bad script and so-called government principles. If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors develop their characters, successful tried-and-tested camera techniques and lighting principles studied to better manage his crew and if the manuscript had actually been worked instead of written for a week or so (according to very compliant documentary) it might have been more of a movie. Instead, it's a movie that has a sense of potential and has few moments in it (more on the genre than the movie itself), but ends up showing almost every frame what shouldn't be done. To see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like, see Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home video (no joke), get the Book Creatures.
