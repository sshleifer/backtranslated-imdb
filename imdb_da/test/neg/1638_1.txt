The credits come from Sandy Frank's stitching job, which was made to make this movie Cave Dwellers for re-release. Now it's done ... oh! Creepy, eye-catching pain. Blade Master runs unharmed on the sword and wagon vehicle started by the Conan flicks ... except that the wagon never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian flick is a dud trying to tear off a box office dud, with predictable results. However, this would give too little credit to the director and the authors, who do nothing to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any form of era-accurate continuity. Miles O'Keefe is no leading man, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved it if Ator did not). Just an unlikeable image and a task to watch.
