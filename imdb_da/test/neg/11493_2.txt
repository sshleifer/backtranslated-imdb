This is the perfect example of how a great book turns into a bad movie. The direction just gives the impression that the movie was composed when they joined together, and Patrick Swaze is then wood, you can almost see the puppet strings on his body. Spy Vs Spy movies are not - or should not - be about cargo and shooting, the bad ones in these movies are really bad shots and miss the protagonists even when in shiny areas. <br /> <br /> Even the shooters are just a clich√© with the usual mounting of sidewalks and collisions through tables and chairs - gaping. <br /> <br /> I was halfway through and off - completely bored.
