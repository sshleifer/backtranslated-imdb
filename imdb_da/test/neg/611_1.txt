I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer trying to give creative license to television writers trying to explore a true story. This story about Karen Carpenter could have helped so many, but because of management and editing it does not. <br /> <br /> In this case, the story is not fully addressed unless you read psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been edited ... Louise Fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors credit to survive this project. Why is the audience not allowed to see causal factors? .... American audiences are quite wise and if they have cable, usually trained. <br /> <br /> I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, would not have edited the truth and allowed the actors to project reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and offended American audiences. The history of the guy is important and it is sad we will never hear it.
