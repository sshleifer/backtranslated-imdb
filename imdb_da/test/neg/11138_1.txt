I think the trash really sucks. I saw it a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't seen that kind of c ** at the movie theater since Female Trouble by John Waters, and it was even worse. Dialogues, the play; It really stank, it was so bad it made me leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But I'm actually glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion about it. One should watch this movie even if it stinks.
