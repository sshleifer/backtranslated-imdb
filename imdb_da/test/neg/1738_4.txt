This movie started out as a pretty decent-looking movie, but it was never completely kicked, instead it was predictable and even a little stupid. Some scenes were quite well made, the photography and the cuts that were used in combination with sounds and such made it a little more interesting to see, but since the story was quite slow, the interest failed to keep alive. And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It was supposed to be a horror movie, but there wasn't a single scene that was close to scary or even exciting. To be honest, the actors were not so great nor any colorful characters you will remember for the rest of your days. <br /> <br /> All in all, a flip-flop film, but it doesn't add up, and when you're done watching it, it won't be long before it's already forgotten. /> <br /> The reason I saw it was because I had read a review that gave the highest score but I disagree and instead I would rate it 4 out of 10. If you still want to Having some Japanese horrors, I suggest you look Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
