This movie was a mess. There was nothing really going for it. The only sign that was appealed was Bobbie Phillips' Maya and she wasn't even worth it. <br /> <br /> The reason is standard, double crossing double crossing. With a few too many double crosses to make sense. Sometimes it means "keep you guessing" in this case it "keeps you waiting". Eventually I just wanted everyone to be thrown into prison or shot.
