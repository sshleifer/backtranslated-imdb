The only thing I expected this movie to be was an intelligent, talked motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply horrible. I gave it 1 star, which of course means I enjoyed it immensely. Poor acting, poor writing, poor conducting, bad match choreography. The only real actor in this movie is Martin Landau, who, of course, does a good job with the villain, although the character is your standard paper cutter evil CEO / Villain. Even the so-called "plot twist" at the end was no shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much fun in this movie, I enjoyed it a lot. And it had some impressive car wrecks. <br /> <br /> Like bad movies? Check this one out, ouch. Want a good movie? Not here.
