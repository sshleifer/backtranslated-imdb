I am currently 22 years old and remember to watch this movie in the theaters when it first came out. You've heard me right, I was 5 years old, and yet I still remember what I saw that afternoon many years ago. Was it a mysterious ride through Mark Twain's creative world? ... No, on the other hand, it was a pretty scary movie about Mark Twain's dark, depressed and actually suicidal side. A scene still bothering me was a particularly strange scene where Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. Would an adult enjoy this movie? Well, this movie may contain some interesting views that a person with a knowledge of Mark Twain's writing may enjoy; But trust me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce your young children to Mark Twain.
