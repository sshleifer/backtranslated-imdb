Am I the only one to note that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is mistaken. In fact, it's a 15th century, just around 1620, if the memory serves me because the "realistic" ship in the movie is Mayflower, now as far as I know Mayflower, NEVER went to Australia or even tried a trip to Australia. I don't know who handled R&D for this movie, but by using Mayflower and hoping no one will notice, it's actually a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the cover and the DVD. I wonder how can other people notice this little blunder? Not to mention that the movie itself was absolutely horrible, I would have expected better from Sam Neill.
