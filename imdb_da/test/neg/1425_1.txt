Not since "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" and "How High" previews <br /> <br /> I've been laughing a little at something that movie producers thought would be hysterical. <br /> Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as 4-F <br /> by the army and decides to spend his money to raise his own army - about half a dozen. He then mimics a Nazi commander in <br /> <br /> Italy and ultimately tries to kill Hitler. It is the description of the <br /> <br /> flat plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is as fun as a heart attack. This movie makes "Hogans <br /> <br /> Heroes" like Shakespeare. If the money men from "The <br /> Producers" really wanted to lose their money, they should have shown this movie. I can't stress how bad this thing is. <br /> <br /> The Lewis direction consists of two different cameras that shoot <br /> <br /> action from two different angles and then edit together. This kind of direction works on television, but here it is an obvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of his scenes with a snapshot as if giving the viewer a chance to double <br /> <br /> in stitches before going to the next tired setup. I spent most of the <br /> <br /> movie doubled in abdominal pain, accompanied by <br /> <br /> severe flatulence, over this thing. <br /> <br /> Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943 but does not make <br /> <br /> any attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone has the latest style and has the latest decor ... for 1970. <br /> <br /> Support is lost when Lewis goes out on his patented keys, <br /> <br /> which lasts as long as major surgery and is as painful to <br /> <br /> see. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he uses the last half of the film, screaming at the top of the lungs in a <br /> <br /> performance that is so wild to stink any good will you try to bring. /> <br /> In the beginning. <br /> <br /> The final embarrassing shot has Lewis and his companions trying to <br /> <br /> put one in Japanese. They carry buck teeth, skew their <br /> eyes and talk in a "fun" accent. It can be one of the most incredible racist incidents since the detention camps. I was <br /> <br /> relaxed what Lewis did through this whole thing, but it put me <br/> <br /> over the edge. Look at Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene <br /> <br /> where she tries to try suicide again and again. <br /> <br /> "Star Trek" s George Takei has two small scenes, so wisely <br /> <br /> falls out of the picture. This has less grin than Mel Brooks' last <br /> <br /> three films combined. There is nothing more sad than seeing a previously respected comedian, so screwing a project so terribly that you are actually ashamed of them. Jim Carrey learned it with "The <br /> Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still appears on television once in a <br /> <br /> while drawing the same eerie schtick. I'm sorry about him. <br /> <br /> "Which way to the front?" is cheap, unfunny, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved and everyone who has to endure this. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although classified (G), this includes physical violence, some weapons and some adult situations. If your child is interested in <br /> <br /> seeing this, contact professional help. <br /> <br />
