This film has been promoting anywhere in Spain with a great advertising campaign, after seeing it, you realize someone has stolen your money. Paz Vega is horrible as Carmen, she is not at all natural, and she looks like she is doing a fashion magazine in all shots ("the best" is when she, as an Andalusian woman ... can speak Basque and fluentÂ¡, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her as Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot doesn't work and the manuscript is really very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would have been a much more credible and sexy Carmen . <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
