This was terrible, transparent and full of the worst clich√©s and racest stereotypes I've seen in a long time. Seeing Hayden P, who tried to act "ghetto" was painful (hello, a trouser leg up on your sweat and some braids that don't make you "down with the homies"). Solange largely knows grimaces throughout the film. Most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes ... what was the final ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to make people see her "action" that she can't. <br /> <br /> Simply, this movie Downs't even deserves a star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the next. Take it on IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
