I just watched this movie, and all I can say is where is driving in these days. It looks like it would have been a great second feature at a drive in 1977 (perhaps with one of these Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth seeing now if you feel nostalgic for 70 's. Silly plot filled with holes but it resembles one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive but not much of an actress. In fact, there is not much action going on in this movie at all. It's kind of a Duke of Hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 Dodge charger jumping over things in Woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet jumping over a dump in this!
