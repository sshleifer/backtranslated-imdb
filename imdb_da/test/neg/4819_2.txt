New Orleans is nothing like what is depicted in this <br /> <br /> debacle of a movie. Quaid's attempt to talk to a cajun <br /> accent (by the way, there are hardly anyone who speaks that way in New Orleans <br /> <br />) is terrible. Plot = elementary and thoughtless. This <br /> <br /> image refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves a gradual process whereby a viewer gets guidance and phrases throughout a movie. There is none of this here. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" tries to get past on New Orleans stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the city <br /> <br /> that Quaid & Barkin is booming.
