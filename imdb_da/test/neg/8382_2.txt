While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), the best student in the class, convinces his schoolmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas ) to investigate the massacre of worshipers of Kwan Yin by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an old amulet in southern China who would give him a tremendous power for the victims of human souls, but a woman resists and he is destroyed. But after Morgan's death, apparently committing suicide, students discover that Quinlin has returned and chases their souls with his amulet. The story of 'Cult' is not bad. Unfortunately, the manuscript, the direction, the play, the lines, the camera, the CGI and the edition are terrible. I was totally bored and tempted to use the DVD's FF button, but I resisted and wasted 90 minutes in my life and watched this one-time crap on a Saturday night. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The Secret Charm")
