Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not thriller, not thrill, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Scary bad. After many years of lurking here on IMDb, I actually move to create an account so that I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It trusts your SEED, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes the movies so bad, or at least an hour and a half, if you're not smart enough to hit the hotkey. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's voice over on an "improved" DVD (there is another horrible thought) to see what the hell they were thinking. The producers had to assume that there were enough sugars out there to fall to the Val Kilmer name to make this movie at least broken even in international distribution. <br /> <br /> In fact, I had the misfortune to choose this to watch movies on request, which did not provide subtitles for Russian dialogue. Not that it was very important. Straining to hear the Russians, translate it into your head (if you can) to find out just how boring it is, just add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie a "1" because I can't give it a lower rating and because it achieved a remarkable thing. It somehow made an almost completely underground film, NOT feeling claustrophobic. Now it is a questionable achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the final, holy mother (no saying is calculated), it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop recording. "Climax" of the movie is literally done seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I've ever seen on film. Exercise your simple escape mechanism, too, if you find yourself seeing this - the Off button.
