This movie should rank with "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for pure god-horror. You have the most annoying heroine in your story, who spends most of her time spinning and crying and screaming - all the time in the most horrible resting toilet ever put on film. Why she spends so much time in this horrible hell-like bathroom is never explained. Even when the usual killer truck driver tries to murder her, she refuses to leave crapper. When a motorbike man comes to his rescue, the killer drives the truck driver over the police legs while the heroine just looks at it. Instead of grabbing her gun for protection, she pulls the poor veil into the crapper and locks the door. Then the police orders her to blow out the brain because of the pain. She does it - while he cries and sneaks and looks - and turns his back off his head. Then - the police still alive ask her to shoot him again because he still has pain. He says this while the entire back of his head is over the floor. The insidious, mocking heroine shoots him again. The movie continues and continues like this, none of it makes sense. Heroine is so crazy that you really want the killer off her early. I saw this flick on the Sci-Fi channel so it didn't cost me anything to look at, but I still looked out of pure fascination about how a movie could end up so terribly bad.
