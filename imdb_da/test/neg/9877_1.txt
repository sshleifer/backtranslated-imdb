I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First, it is the prospect of anyone watching the film and never reading (and perhaps never reading) the book. The other is from one who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without book) From a movie point of view, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as one of the underworld, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about plot. The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, although the wolf transformation was very nice. The characters have very little development, and Vivian did not even worry about her "love" killing what was left of her species. Some of the other characters might have had more air time, like The Five. The plot was very similar to Underworld for my taste. <br /> <br /> (Movie WITH book) As many have said, except for the title, character name and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. In the film Gabriel was much older and was the father of Rafe (thus Astrid was once his friend). In the book, Gab was about 24, never mated to anyone since wolves are alive (Astrid tries to win her love) and Astrid was Ulf's, not Rafe's mother. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie has it as Vivian's fault and the whole family was killed because of it. In the book, the original leader of the Five, called Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters tracked the wolves and killed many of them (Viv's father included), forcing them to move. Also, Viv's mother, Esme was a great character. <br /> <br /> One thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been "the bitch's dance". For those who do not know it, the trial is where all the bitches (females in the package) struggle to see who should be the new leader's mate (since there was previously the fight for the men). Vivian won it and tried to save her mother from Astrid (there is a horrid evil woman in the book) and should therefore be ready for Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, I strongly suggest NOT watching this movie.
