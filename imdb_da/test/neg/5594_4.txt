First of all, the first thing that came to mind after I finished this movie last night was "Why the 8MM 2 title?" Because I saw the first one of course, and what has to do with it the first movie's plot? The only thing that looked like was that the couple had to go into the porn industry, and it wasn't even necessary in the plot, because after you've seen the end that I don't want to spoil it, it just hasn't made sense. <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his fiance are in Hungary and notice a woman swimming naked in the pool area, she is very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have some fun and have a steaming triangle. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat sends pictures of those who all have the affair, fears it may become public and threaten his career, they pay the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat rages out and "kills" the guy, leading to a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they move on to what they came in. What could have been a good thriller, turned into an inexplicable and not well thought out film that was sad. As I said, the title has nothing to do with the first, if not for that. It's just a sexual thriller that doesn't make sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because it is quite honest that this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it just as well can be felt as soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
