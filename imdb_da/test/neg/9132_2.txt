I was very disappointed with this movie. The director has shown some talent in his other efforts, but it just seemed to be filler. There may have been a profound significance behind it, but it seems to me other than a director who has access to some toys. I would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one. When I saw it, I continued to think it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the film I was neither entertained nor moved or thought of things in a new way. I could only say to myself, "What was that?" There were a couple of really striking parts of the movie, but not enough to justify sitting through it again.
