For the uninitiated, almost every Andy Milligan movie is a shock, but despite the fact that I have seen many of his films, this one still takes the cake for sheer foam. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is Milligan taking on the Sweeney Todd story, made with period features (but not necessarily periodic hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-causing camera work and grain quality. As for gore, well, the version I saw may have been cut some, because there is not much for a movie with "bloodthirsty" in the title. The best indication of subversive film production here is a meat pie that only consists of some poor victim's often. <br /> <br /> So while I still want to treasure this work on my video shelf, it's definitely something of a letdown as far as content though. Recommended for only the stupid and morbid curious. 3 out of 10
