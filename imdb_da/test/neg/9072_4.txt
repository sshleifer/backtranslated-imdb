Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager living for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there but lacks Ed's one-sided devotion to his job, he is there because he accidentally destroyed his car teacher Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay compensation. When Mondo Burger, a mammoth fast footstool opens across the street, it seems that Good Burger is history until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door. The monomaniacal manager of Mondo Burger, Kurt (Jan Schweiterman) is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put Good Burger out of service. Meanwhile, Ed and Dexter will save Otis (Abe Vigoda), the world's oldest fast food employee, from Demented Hills Asylum, and Ed can only find love with Monique (Shar Jackson) if he would like burgers long enough to pay attention to her. Good Burger is a comedy aimed at children, decent history, acting and generally a rather harmless kids movie.
