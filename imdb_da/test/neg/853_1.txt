When I first looked at the back cover of this movie, it looked to me, and my friends could look forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it was definitely memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you still ask yourself how it was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Out of all the movies available at the video rental store that night ... we could just have chosen the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused myself a little. Who came up with the idea that it would be fun if the narrator could change the story with suggestions from the protagonist? Out of all the stupid things you can completely destroy a movie with, it's now my favorite. The character Foggerty, the village's idiot, played by Nickolas Grace, is the most annoying character since they started making films in color. If there is a single movie that you definitely shouldn't see this year, let it be Puckoon, because I don't think it can be worse. I still wonder if this could just have been the worst way I spent my money, and take my word that I have made many miserable purchases over the years.
