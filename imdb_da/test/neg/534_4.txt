It's a nicer, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent, and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme movie, or is it capper to the universe's trilogy? I'm still confused about it. Either way, there really was no reason for this movie. What was needed? Angelina Jolie. She can play an assassin robot that can explode in the middle of coitus, but what a road and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winning.
