wow, i just got it to see this. <br /> <br /> How CRAPPY post production is on this movie. <br /> <br /> I won't let you go, I could literally have done a better job myself. <br /> <br /> ALL post production is flawless, all in all. Anyone who cuts this movie should be banned from the film industry. <br /> <br /> It was a train break that was aside. absolutely rubish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in Spongebob's accent. WTF is his character there? But for me, the biggest mistake of all character development was, interaction, dynamics, dialogue. WOW. I can't believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, a great actress, too bad is the production, which everyone looks like amateurs out there. <Br /> <br /> The other 1 goes to filmography, which was actually good. <br /> <br /> Other than what my friend is, it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I don't even think it seems like making a more detailed comment on this, it was just awful production. Bad actors, did not know what they came into ...
