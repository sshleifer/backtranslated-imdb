What a horrible movie. This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and was just confusing. All the time I looked at it, I wish it would end !! I felt I wasted 2 hours in my life that I will never come back. Save your money and not rent this movie. Now I see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was hardly in the movie. The first movie was great but it was just sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer because it's all about the one thing worth watching with this movie. This movie didn't have any real story either. I still wonder what I saw.
