I should know better. I've watched many of Rob Lowe's early work to expect some good from this movie, though it's about hockey. Here we have another tired sports theme. Kid has the potential for greatness, it seems to go a long way if his cabbage attitude does not screw things up. And boom, he comes out of what the helluva plays kind of master. Is that all that can be said about sports movies? There must certainly be other things that athletes take on. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie has to be one of the biggest cheeseballs. Everyone's interactions are just pretty stupid and not in a silly funny kind of way. And I can't think of any additional qualities that could aggravate my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very little from the skate sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a sucker for the 80's movie, though they tend to be a little fishy (ie North Shore, Karate Kid), but it doesn't even waste 80's. For a good 80s sports movie, check out elsewhere. There are lots of them out there.
