Why do I hate this? Let me list the roads: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman playing a 12-year-old is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a battle scene where children throw bricks at each other and it is considered fun --- and it goes for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Strange how none of the kids themselves are far injured. <br /> <br /> The title cards feature lots of racial and ethnic slumps <br /> <br /> For a "family" movie, the fighting was too violent (loved it when Pickford knocked it out with a little boy! ) and humor was just stupid <br /> <br /> Seriously, 40 minutes I gave up and knocked it off. The veil, racism and small children threw bricks on each other, came to me. Also there was no plot that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this movie was William Haines, who was a leading leader in the quiet era. Just painful. Avoid.
