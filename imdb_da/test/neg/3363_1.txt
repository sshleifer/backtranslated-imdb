Jack Frost 2. The worst horror movie I've ever seen. Why? 1) The prerequisite is good beyond ridiculous 2) The awful thing doesn't even have the legs to move on! 3) It escapes after being completely immersed in Anti-Freeze (first movie) 4) Get this ... It travels all the way across a sea of ​​SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to avenge the sheriff who made him in it first movie. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I have not yet drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man", as if writing this, Jack Frost 2 keeps the distinction of being the stupidest "horror" movie ever. Yet it transcends its predecessor (if you can believe it!).
