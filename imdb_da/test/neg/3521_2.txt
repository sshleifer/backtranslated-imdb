usually a movie that starts poorly remains poor in a monotonic downward pattern. This bad movie started to get better before entering a steep dive. The action, except for the male antagonist, was horrible. The reason was essentially a setup for the last main scene, which is probably good as a performance art, but it was wasted in this movie. Not sure why this movie was made.
