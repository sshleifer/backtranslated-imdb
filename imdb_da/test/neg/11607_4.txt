The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character is like another user says "unnecessarily cruel". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, played well in the sharply dressed, but appropriately bumbling, Robert Montgomery. The movie has some fun moments, especially when Montgomery character goes in great lengths to try to get his "wife" back. Understandably, she is disturbed because the marriage is technically not legal, but she finds only three years in it. Lombard's character seems quite cold for her "husband's" sincere attempt to return her. Although Montgomery is not highly skilled in this effort, it is still visibly affectionate, yet Lombard is as cool as a pillar. There are almost no traces of any kind of reconciliation between the warring couple too much of the movie, and it's hard to see any kind of comedy - even dark comedy - in that aspect. To some extent, the film suggests almost a sadistic undertone, with Lombard's character getting a "kick" out of her husband's weak effort. While considering this second "Battle of the Sexes" type of movie, the reality is that it is a very biased blow if it: Montgomery's character, but certainly defective, is not wrong enough to make it a typical example on the masculine chauvinist / misogynist (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in the "War of the Roses"). In fact, the character is widely used as revealed by not only the sharp dress of Montgomery (which is probably largely due to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort in trying - but failing to play the role of a womanizing bachelor . His only big mistake is his vanity, but that error is not in balance with his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no suggestion that she try to instill any jealousy out of unconscious love. It makes it so cruel and sad. Montgomery character simply looks. In fact, no wife would have a man so weak unless she "wears her pants" in marriage. But again, a woman wearing the pants in a marriage will never try to be so cruel because she has already confirmed that role early. Therefore, the whole theme seems strange. This movie is neither a champion of feminism (Lombard's characters show some signs of the independent orientated woman of the 60s, but this idea is soon lifted and the character falls back in the 1940s), not even a uniform stroke of the sexes (as Montgomery's character is really a cipher for masculinity and thus a lost cause). This film is on the surface a slapstick, but under the veneer it is much darker with sadistic undertones. Everything that makes its resolution seem good, strange. (Maybe the oddity was the whole point?). In any case, slapstick this movie is not.
