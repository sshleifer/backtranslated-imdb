Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It is bizarre that they will cancel a well-written program such as "Arrested Development" and yet they keep this show and "War at Home". I feel Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then "Gift with Children", but now it just becomes ridiculous. "The Loop" is a meaningless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work, keep the jokes coming. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant stream of jokes. Fox will pull the heads out of their rectal cavities and stop letting their relatives write this mediocre trip. I think if you have to invest money in doing something entertaining, make it entertaining. Also stop using "unnamed" actors. It's great to have up-and-comers, but you must anchor a show with a famous celebrity. Duh, Fox.
