I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher was not involved in this "movie". An American leftist laundry list of axes to paint with a clear economy of democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not happen in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Maybe we have to wait for these California spin doctors to slaughter Paradiso to show the ideologues of all their political ideologues. <br /> <br /> Cheap shots of religion, right-wing politicians, businesses and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs. All the radical leftist points were completely covered - while omitting references to "other sideways offenses" - not having been a deliberate effort. The unique exception I noticed in an hour and a half is that JFK must have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity: The award in these propaganda books in a pathetic attempt to appear as non-partisan.
