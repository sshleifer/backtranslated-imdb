OH My God, I'm Lost Now I know everything this guy does, Pointless R J A wrote on August 13, 2006 (item 881): What a terrible experience. It looked like a bunch of 3 graders stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software from 1995 and played a joke on each other.

The story was very hard to follow. Attempts at artistic camera angles detracted from the story, and in itself made a dizzying experience. The actor though comic was very amateurish. The concept is ok, I think. Perhaps next time, manufacturers would have to raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again. I have to say that I am sick and tired of so many that making a good movie is easy. It is not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any education / experience and talent they can make a good product. I finally assume that they will learn how difficult it is, I am so angry. I have no comments Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (item 762):
