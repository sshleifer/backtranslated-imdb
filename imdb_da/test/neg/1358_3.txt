Every once in a while there is an indie that has a fantastic cast and a story that sounds really interesting and cannot be missed, but the movie sucks. Some recent movies belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Objects Safety" and now here is "The United States of Leland". Said awesome cast includes Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, a son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits an alarming and unforgivable crime (murder of a late child), but cannot remember it and does not seem to have any motive. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the juvenile hall trying to understand Leland (and also exploiting him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his ex-boyfriend. We see their deteriorating conditions (due to her heroin dependence) in flashback. It sounds like a great little drama, huh? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> The fact is, this movie is just bad, badly written. The dialogue and narrative are painfully pretentious and burdened with annoying fluttering about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while making Leland sympathetic in some ways, it shines upon his crime. <br /> <br /> Mostly, there is no problem with the actor. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in "The Believer") is an extremely talented young actor, but the way they are written is none of these characters (at least of all Leland) even real people, so there is not much He can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen. Even playing a signed character in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with a look. When she has good material to work with (as in "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"), she is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> But this is not good material. Perhaps after a massive rewriting, it might have been worthwhile, but as it is, "The United States of Leland" is milder, inactive and for a movie that falls in love with how "deep" it is, it's really low.
