This program would be useful for training hard-core basic human emotions. In addition to this, the performance has no other value than to fill the bandwidth that would otherwise go unused in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of excitement and expectation listening to a computerized voice chip that infinitely drones out the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, the helpful and frequent songs will tell viewers how to feel if they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and superficial line. I found Amy to be a superficially positive character as she is a role model for young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is governed solely by the involuntary personal guidelines Amy chooses to employ, resulting in Amy's attempts that resemble appeal to the personal mercy of a tribal despot rather than a genuine court order. This show is uncomfortable to any extent, although this is somewhat mitigated after two episodes of the god's God-given filtering processes, fortunately the show will leave the same impression on the viewer's memory as a television set to a dead channel at maximum volume.
