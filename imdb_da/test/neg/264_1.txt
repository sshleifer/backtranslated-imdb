Oh, how the critics fell upon themselves to praise their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of taxi driver) when this movie came out. I never saw the qualities they discovered when I watched this movie back in the day, so I re-watched it to see if I got it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a cold, eerie film about a writer who lives / works in a cool abstrus culture. The flat reenactments do not hold your attention because they are emotionally agile and stagy. And the rest of it sits just to be horrible ... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they promise, hair splitting about purity, admiration of swords, etc. It must be a victory when you learn you've landed Philip Glass; But then you have to get something out of him. Glasses score does not give a distinction from his other work, nor does it give the film any appreciable value. In 2010, it should be clear to everyone that Schrader spread his career at work without meaning or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can drill you to pieces and kill the speed of the movie faster than anyone else. Schrader has made a resume full of miserable amateur movies.
