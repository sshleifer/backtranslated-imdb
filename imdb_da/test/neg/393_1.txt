I have a word: focus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten text lines. Okay. Let's discuss the fine focus points. I don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless nap, like "you all want to be famous avant-garde filmmakers one day" - but they also taught us how to make this crazy thing called FOCUS Lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a clock. The person who shot what Alice found needed to learn a few things about the finer focus points. lighting also. This movie is not just out of focus, it is also lit as the corner of a person's basement. <br /> <br /> Not even getting me started with pacing or plot. They could have trimmed about ten seconds from the beginning and end of each shot. <br /> <br /> But who cares about it anyway? There is not enough lurid in this movie to compensate for the complete lack of respect for the movie's best friends - FOCUS, and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> Words to the wise.
