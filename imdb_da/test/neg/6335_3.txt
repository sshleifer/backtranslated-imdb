Yet another cookie-cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets a cute, street-smart kid (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And once again it is not fun or interesting for anyone to see - children or adults. I'm sure some people might find this movie entertaining, but I have no earthly idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work in this movie so that everyone else and their parents could make some money for the price of a cheesy cheese film.
