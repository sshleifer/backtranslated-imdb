I used to love Muppets. The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were great family movies, wisely written and fun to watch. I never thought I would see the day when they would jump on Hollywood sleaze bandwagon, but here it is: Scooter like a caged rave dancer, Pepe makes indecent and suggestive comments every five minutes - this is not your father's Muppets. It's not Jim Henson's Muppets either. <br /> <br /> This "It's A Wonderful Life" movie has its moments but not enough to save it. I cringed while I saw this with my kids. I still hope for their next movie, but this was definitely a disappointment.
