If you thought tomorrow was inappropriate, wait until you see this. <br /> <br /> Okay, the assumption for most disaster movies is usually 1 billion. Event that is enhanced by other circumstances. In this case, evenly joining two large storm systems. Fair enough so far. Oh, but stop, no, the "event" is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the mains. <br /> <br /> Then put lots of human interest elements - in this case a cheating man, a psychotic gun-swinging girlfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda, a reporter tries to stand up against the "man" and a pregnant woman is stuck in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a handful of key events to add excitement. <br /> <br /> Jeez, if the director tried to fit into more meaningless plot lines, there would have been some time less for the actual disaster which, given the pitiful state of computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Jeez, if you can't even model a truck convincingly, you really shouldn't go on twisters, exploding power plants, Las Vegas getting torn apart or destroying oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you haven't already gathered together how scary this movie is, let me add that all three bad guys are killed in separate and utterly eerie, incredible manners that stink more of the moralization of the good film production. I have no problem with first-month movie students writing jaded, hackneyed, clich√©-soaked scripts, but for God's sake, it doesn't mean anyone should make them movie! The rocks to make the abysmally inappropriate 10.0 apocalypse look not quite as terrible. Avoid them both.
