Sad one sign with next to no development, unimpressive notions from people that sound like they just read lines and ridiculous special effects combine to make this a real stinker. The story begins with incredibly gentle command Russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al Qaida training base. The scene tells us that al-Qaeda has recently come to find an ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate Russo's only trait, a tendency to prevent teamwork. Using a collection of glossy slate and walking stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to the Chechen territory to capture a mad scientist working for the terrorists. Along the way, they encounter large hordes of meat fluttering flying in broad daylight for some reason. Then the movie becomes nothing more than a drag of ridiculous action, including a scene where a swarm of bats slices a soldier's arm away!
