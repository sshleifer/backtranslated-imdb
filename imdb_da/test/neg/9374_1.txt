After some quite OK Dutch action flicks, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage will make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He is not a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft fabrics. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands and this film is just another example. But even then the film could be very nice if the story was okay. Now there are big jumps in time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary drug-boy, the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug scene. No one knows how it is possible (except for those who read the book). The action is really bad, the non-Dutch film actors see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. When you think she finally gets naked, you see a stand in model. So: bad play + bad montage + crap story = De dominee. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at it, though others say it is good because it is not. I've warned you.
