The devil's men represent what turned out to be one of the last gasp of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70s shortly before Halloween came together, tore up the control book, beat it and kicked it through a glass plate. To cut a long story short a few entertaining Greek filmmakers fancy their chances of stitching together a new movie franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanizing, wisely speaking American investigator Milo and pricking but kind hearted priest Father Roche. A damned nobleman mixed in some satanic jiggery pokery - offering tourists as victims of an extremely fragile minotaur decor and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or so. <br /> <br /> The reality is, however, terribly boring, frustrating and filled with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the exciting filmmakers blew most of the budget on getting Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (on the soundtrack) aboard and hoping it would be enough to swing the audience into the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> That's not it. The devil's men look beautiful with secured, camera work and amazing places. Eno's score, but in principle just one chord drone, which he is likely to twist in an afternoon, is suitably atmospheric, and the movie is loaded with cracking 70's curls, including the austrailian being from Fawlty Towers and uber hottie Jane Lyle of Death Island infamy . But that ends positive. Cushing sleepwalks through it, looks like he has a corn cob up his bum and Pleasance fusses about trying his best, but never quite getting things right. To make matters worse, Milo's character is terribly flimsy and unlikely. Okay, so it doesn't look so good. But from there, the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that the local villagers possess, but to be fair to them, they never really do much more than shuffle about seeing glassy eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Only when you are sure, things will come to some sort of head. Milo and Roche interrupt Baron's satanic party with ridiculous ease and send him to meet his maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> The real optimism that The Devil's But may be the first of a series of movies, is hammered home by Father Roche's last line just seconds before the ridiculously rushed end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can again encourage you to help defeat the antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you will put the call in every day now Donald.
