The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and exciting. The other half was pretty bad. The cartoon revenge story came in full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted "good guys" blow them away. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not afraid of violence, but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose in the violence here except to create a genre film, where we see lots of people being knocked down with rifles. We must somehow be entertained by this. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Reservoir Dogs. There was a film where violence was recruited effectively. It was realistic in the world that the film created. There was never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie that played it right. Inglorious Basterds should have played it right, but it didn't. I rolled my eyes on how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets for the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the history of any of the Basterds is really explained, they are also simply Nazi hunters. We don't really like any of them, even because they are too busy cutting scalps and shooting people in the face. It's about "revenge" and very little else. There were 2 1/2 hours to work with here, but few of the Basterds were really investigated in depth. It looks like it was simply a revenge girl clean and simple. We saw it in Tarantino's last flick, "Death Proof", which I don't care about. It suffered the same problems. The signs were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was again quite good. I wanted to see the exploitation of Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a very lamer film about the Resistance Movement, showing revenge on some comic Nazis when they all go to a film prize in France.
