I have rarely seen a literature work translated so badly into the screen. The hysterical cast of b-movies and sitcom extras simply makes the characters seem like bad Jewish stereotypes. Worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, who you hate from the scene one and never develops any sympathy. Performances like this should be noted and used for actors who want to work again. All in all, a seedy low budget is made-to-TV movie of the kind that gives TV movies a bad name.
