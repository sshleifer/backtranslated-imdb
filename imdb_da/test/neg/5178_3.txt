This movie could have been great. It's not in my opinion. The story is fragmented, the editor doesn't seem to be able to choose between a Guy Ritchie style of narrative and a more straightforward one. There is great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very superficial and stereotypical, I would have liked to have seen more depth there. It is difficult to identify with the protagonist. The result is that the film remains superficial as a whole. The film says it gives the viewer an insight into the British criminal subclass, especially the Essex subclass. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots and lots of violence. Violence caused by paranoia and fear in general. In this movie, no one seems to use his (or her) brain, we look at a bunch of animals in clothing. As I said, there is not much of a plot, and the story tells a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a man under 30, you like gore and hardcore violence and think it's entertaining than this is a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that shows real people with a well-developed story, excitement and depth, well ... you can skip this one.
