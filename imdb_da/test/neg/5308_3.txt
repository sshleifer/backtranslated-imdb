If pulp fiction and Get shorty did not exist, it could be an OK movie. When I say this, I mean that nothing from this movie is it's own unless it's another bit of horrible dialogue or a cliché full scene. All the lines are 'I will not say more than I must, if from Get Shorty seems to appear in this fragile sequel, all the comets that Steven Tylers acted terribly and are not necessary, and for Christina Milian, man, Don't let me get started. Some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be trying to be down with the kids and hips and have almost destroyed that reputation because of this movie and I honestly think the best actress is from The Rock plays with one of my least favorite actors, Vince Vaughn. The man is trying to be fun all the time with him who takes the weird of how apparently rappers speak. Cedric, the entertainer and other 3000 plays another terribly double act (I personally think the background actors were better than Cedric and others), and The only fun part of Cedric, Andre's and Cedar that does that is the way pants are down to the knees so you can clearly see boxers, and the only reason I find it fun is because many people are clean actually doing so. Finally, this movie tries to be fun and erroneous, it has no new material, comedy or coolness all the way through as it copies all other movies and finally the only reason you need to see it is if you want to compare how bad it is that it is brilliant predecessor Get shorty.Oh yes i forgot to mention there is a big cliché at the end.
