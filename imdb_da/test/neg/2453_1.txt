I watched about an hour in this movie (against my will) and couldn't finish it. I would judge it as a 0. The scripture was bad, plotted predictably, and one that has been done too many times. The most annoying part of this movie was the play by Melody Thomas Scott. This part did not require anyone to appear snobbish, but she succeeded in every scene that I seemed to look like a (sour) snob or a person who had to spout something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /> <br /> The two romances that seemed to evolve into something serious almost on the couple's meeting were a little too much. <br /> <br /> I should know better than watching made for TV movies. If there is absolutely nothing on the telly and that is the only choice, read a book.
