This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly ... who! You are a genius and an unpleasant one, and the world kisses the earth you are going on. And surprisingly, all the other smart people are losers. They do not know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult, but these professors can still analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Any movie has something good in it anyway, and Robin Williams is in it.
