Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in "screaming teen" cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways, Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of naivety and innocence of young people with endless horror movies such as Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teens, have sex, run around and scream and one-on-one are picked up by some kind of monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced with pride, retribution and arrogance. The characters had several options to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so because of their own personal demons. In the end, you were back with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps not) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the movie also touches strongly on following a leader or authority. This was used in direct sense of whether the protagonist would be like serial killer and also used less directly throughout the film. After a central figure is a restoring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Throughout, the filmmakers have also incorporated a lot of clichés that I suppose were deliberate and gave the film a unique blend of depth as well as superficiality that I found exciting. This may unintentionally play well with the characters that at first appearance are very shallow, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are at least the two main characters that are quite complex. Technically speaking, however, the film has many problems. The cinematography, which is typically considered high, I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, using formal 2/3 approaches too rigid. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of the symbolism was not only vague, but also much used. The plot was poorly planned and was merely misinformation to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and left the viewers confused. Methods used to solve the climax are cheap and poorly prepared, motivations are routinely blurred, and large plot points remain unbound at last. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie's relative originality, themes and treatise are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-styled imagery, blurred motifs, blunt and unnecessary symbolism and cheap phrases maintained only by missing or completely incorrect information . <br /> <br /> If the movie was better done, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes only receives two stars in my opinion.
