This cheap and rubbish movie is about a NASA test rocket that is sent in space with a load of animals. It disappears for a while, then returns unexpectedly, crash landing in a forest, freeing a vicious mutant being. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of this type, Night Fright, stupid teens boogieing down to the 60s surfing music before being killed. However, none of the murders are even remotely memorable, as we do not really see anything. One thing we see, however, is that one teenager seems to be about 40 years old and sports a pretty impressive silly haircut. <br /> <br /> To be a creative function to work, it must really present its monster to the viewer correctly. In this movie, however, we get only the shortest glimpse of the monster. It seems that it looks like the alien from the Robot Monster. But I'm not sure when the photography was so dark, I simply couldn't figure out what hell was going on much of the time. Although my gut feeling was that I was probably not missing much.
