I can't believe this movie gets the assessment that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I have come to conclude that IMDb is something worthless to actually find out if a movie is good or not, as 99% of the films are rated from 6 to 7. That is the conclusion and error of crowd-sourcing on the Internet. For this purpose, an average of most people is taken, and unfortunately, most single favorites are easy to entertain fast food lifestyle morons. But I go down. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say that I found it tailored to seemingly two groups of people, young teens, at an age where violent action movies of any kind just hit the spot and goth types that just love to strangle whatever Gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on . If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this movie absurd. I enjoyed the first underworld. It was fresh at the time and kept some sort of edgy quality. The second was a bit to try in the plot, but I could sometimes enjoy the direction and the cinematography. But this whole movie felt like a sci-fi channel production or even a television series. I found the actors to be over-directed. Their body language solidified into un-natural idealistic things that seemed to be constructed. Lines were spat out, which young actors would spit out of the Shakespeare lines and swing in their own selfish glory to be in such a role, but by doing so, destroyed the crudely role. The ground was dry and predictable right from the start. I found that things should just "move together" as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. I tried to break first, but my brain was forced to extinguish. At the end the climax, I actually caught my sleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make it even worth noting them all. If you are a pimple to the teen or a chronic goth, you need it. For the rest of us, forget what I'm doing right now.
