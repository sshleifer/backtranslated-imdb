I live in Mexico City so I have to suffer the trailers for every piece of waste coming out of all those stupid Mexican filmmakers. Want to admire a Mexican guy to make great movies? Take a look at something at Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I really don't like his movies, but I respect them). Mexican film producers often produce some of the most horrible complete waste ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in Mexican movies ever. If you respect your brain, avoid this piece **** at all costs. It would be more intelligent to see some video of a wedding or to see Britney's reality show. It has more IQ than everyone in this 'movie'.
