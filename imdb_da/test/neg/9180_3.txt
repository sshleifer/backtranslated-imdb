Unlike most reviewers of this movie, I'm really not the most of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. But when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic policeman buried in scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to join Cynthia after the captain's (Robert Forster) command. Forster is always observable, it's just a screaming shame that the film itself is so amazing and clich√©. It also has one of the least frightening villains ever committed to celluloid. Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more films, the next being "Down N Dirty". Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T&A; Mary Kapper goes topless <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme
