First, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This film was apparently not targeted to the masses. It is the type that critics would like to see. Hype and advertising were quite misleading. <br /> <br /> I expected something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that the story and the time period required it, I found the film extremely slow. <br /> <br /> I'm a drowsy Aishwarya fan, and I'm sorry to say I thought she was displeased. Chokher Bali's role required an actress to portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. Everyone else gave a good performance. Tagore's depiction of the human condition comes across the cellulose to give the film an interesting theme.
