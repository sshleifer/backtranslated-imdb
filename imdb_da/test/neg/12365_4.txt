With David Arquette starring you would immediately believe this is a stupid movie. Well, it's a silly movie with a horrid script. But F / X, the eight-legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to see. A tribute, albeit on the stupid side, to the great mutant creations of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) are calling for help to fight the poisonous waste-affected giant spiders that cause chaos on their small town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.
