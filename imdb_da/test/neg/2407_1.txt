In short, the only saving grace that this movie has is settings, costumes and an OK punk concert. How H.R.Giger should feel about his cyborg image on the cover of this movie, I do not want to know. Immediately, all I could do was sardonic comments on the movie's main characters, I hoped that "freaks" in this movie would perform them in gory fashion. I sense SPOILERS et comin '! I wondered if this movie in the first 20 mins spirit. was supposed to be as humorous half-baked as the rest of it? Study of all the obvious political protests (Police are trying to rape a "freak", the discussion of superficial relationships between the "freak" and the freak king and the punk concert with the female vocalist) and the use of slowmotion in the battle sequences (which screams "martial arts coordinator ") I just don't know. The character is called "Steve" I was trying to pick up matches with people from the street (he should have been wrinkled and raped) and looks bad when he broke that guy's neck towards the end (will I show you how to do it ?) I have to say this though, if they would have developed other characters better than they did "Splatter", this may have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this movie, it would have got it, but unfortunately it is a 1.
