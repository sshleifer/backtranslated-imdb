Trading the success of the 1975 hit is this movie a cheap story about a plantation where Massa comes down with the slave women, and Missus comes down with the big black stud and with the son of a pulp too. In fact, there is so much to come down to that I really don't know why anyone was bothering to get dressed. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see white women rolling their bare bodies all tied up slaves or you like a movie with tits on the display every five minutes, then this one is for you. <br /> <br /> There is a funny / sad story in here, but it only comes to the end not to disturb all the hot, sweaty sex going on at the plantation.
