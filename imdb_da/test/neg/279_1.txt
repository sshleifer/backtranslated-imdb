I had read the newspaper's reviews of this movie and I have to say that my expectations were very low before I saw Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this sequel is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it the top 5 of the worst movie I've ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all, there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term "story" are kept together loosely at times, but most of the time, the movie just goes along with no purpose or drive. The whole story seems forced, and the manuscript around the story is even more forced to become a farce at times. The actors show up, but do nothing to earn any credit or valuation. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who either survive or are very common. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are also not brilliant. To be honest, I really don't understand how they will be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where to start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine it with extremely intact editing and you begin to look for a tree spoon to cut out your heart. Especially the scene where the whole band has moved out of the prison to be transported by car. Camera zoom for each person just gets boring, and when you are number 3 on 12, you get the message: wow you are cool and can make simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) player Julia Roberts is supposed to be fun, but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> To sum up ... to choose between root canal work and see Ocean's 12, I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you're at it ...
