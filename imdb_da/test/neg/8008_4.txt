I think saying that this movie has too many is not what makes this movie bad. The twists are not the problem with the movie. The story is quite clever and could have been very cool if it was filmed properly. The big problem why everyone complains about the twists in the movie is that the movie is not just fascinating enough to make people follow them. The movie is badly shot (at least in comparison to its genre brother Lock, Stock). Worse: the signs are (although often well-acted) just plain flat. The characters do not have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with one of them, let alone understand them. Oh, and the sites are just awful: places-person (I didn't disturb the credits for your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or decor)
