The reason I gave this movie a 4 was for a couple of reasons, but this movie wasn't that bad. Firstly, the editing I found was also rather poor at times, the manuscript (or whatever they had) was not very good, and if not for Nunzio La Bianca, the play would have happened. But all that aside (haha i know it as the whole movie) is not that bad for an extremely low in. , low budget movie. If they would have got more money, it was a bit better actors (but these were scary so it was good) and a little more detailed script would make this movie great. Someone has to tell me that this guy was much influenced by Walter Hill's warriors. I think this movie is like it. everyone who has seen both films will agree with me.
