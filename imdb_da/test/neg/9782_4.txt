This horror movie starts promising enough and there is a moment when I thought of myself "this will be really good". However, it gets rather boring quite quickly at the end. The plot is pretty good, as is the location and the story starts quite well as well. The problem is not enough to kill on the screen and an end where you have the monster that basically turns tail and run. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene, where I thought the movie was up and going to be a winner. Unfortunately after that the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD lied as it told me that the desert under the people literally came alive and was able to devour their flesh ... now it would have been a movie, an almost inevitable situation. Granted it would have made the viewers unpleasant and it might disturb the excitement, but that's what horror movies have to do! Instead, we have very few shots of being or creatures as it was, and when we see it, it is primarily defensive. Still, it wasn't that bad, it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping.
