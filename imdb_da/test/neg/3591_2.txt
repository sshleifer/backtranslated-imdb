According to my friend's good words, I have hired this movie and hoped that it would at least correspond to the grin of the similar movie, "House Party", but I was very disappointed and very sad. To fall asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I don't know if this didn't appeal to me because I didn't live in "da hood" or if I'm not black, but that's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> It tries to fake a few movies that only come up with a few laughs, but in the long run it otherwise fails. Miss it.
