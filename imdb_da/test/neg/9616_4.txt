*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's going on here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey certainly looks unsexy - as if she had stolen her better reserve wig - puts a convincing performance as a woman killing a wife for a man, she has had an affair with "in self-defense" after having hit his forty odd times with an ax. As Lizzy Borden, she is acquitted, but after the most convincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a presumably "innocent" defendant I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took an ax and gave her father forty whacks As she saw what she had done - she prayed self-defense <br /> <br /> I don't think it <br /> <br / > I find the defendants guilty of screening a convincing portrayal and have nothing but to assign this movie a sentence of 4 out of 10 (which would have been lower but for the past good behavior of some involved) <br / > <br />
