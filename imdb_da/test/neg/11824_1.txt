This movie is embarrassed. Nothing works at any level. The direction, manuscript, play and editing work together to reject your eyes from the screen. Everything is inappropriate and incoherent. Initially, you can sit and moan, twist and laugh at it, but very briefly the whole effort to look just too heavy.
