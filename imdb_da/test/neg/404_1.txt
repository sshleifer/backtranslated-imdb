I watched this movie based on a few comments that said it was bad but fun. But you have to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make the 1950s science fiction movie similar to works of art. This is fun at times, but annoying for the most part. And to put together the problem of the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterizes the majority of depicted events. One of my favorites is where three of the characters lose hundreds of feet in a tunnel created by arachnia and arrive to find it fully illuminated. Apparently, the arachnia has also managed to hook into the electricity grid. Very impressive. But this is just an example. And for what it's worth, the music sucks, the play sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the unpleasant guy is annoying, the so-called beautiful leading man is a geek, and the black girl who falls for him is a fool. Her father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure the short moments of humor might make up for the experience.
