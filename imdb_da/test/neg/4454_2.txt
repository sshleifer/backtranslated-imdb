A lot of Alistair MacLean's books have done so on the big screen. Some of them (Navaron's Guns, Fear is the Key where Eagles Dare) have been translated quite well; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) have been acceptable enough; a few (River of Death, Bear Island, the road to dust death) have been quite rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another movie based on one of MacLean's most popular bestsellers, but unfortunately it is yet another that deserves to add to the "rat" list. Built of uninteresting characters that come in uninteresting situations and escapades, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and an entertainment. Its only half-dissolving qualities are: a) it is recorded in very attractive Provence places, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks amazing (with fully nude scenes to boot) as the most important female character. <br /> <br /> Disillusioned US drives Neil Bowman (David Birney) travels effortlessly through France as he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany each other, and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). The duc persuades the couple to help him protect and escort the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is sought by various shady parties because of some information he carries in his head. Conscious secret from Bowman and Lila is that Zuger has discovered a secret formula to use solar energy as cheap, economic energy. The Hungarian desperately needs to get his formula to New York, but hired weapons have been put on his tracks to catch him ?? Presumably, so he can be taken back to a ruthless criminal gentleman and tortured to reveal his priceless secret that they can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their frightened refugees fleeing the French landscape from their deadly opponents. <br /> <br /> The movie seems terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an ultra low budget independent movie made by a non-professional cast and crew. But a fair amount of money was actually thrown into the movie and everyone involved has done much better work at various points in their career. Therefore, one must assume that the film is poor simply because it is written, acted and directed with a clear lack of care and interest. The pacing is deadly slow, and the plot points become so cumbersome that the viewer must make too much unprofitable effort to follow the story. Birney's performance is not involved, and Rampling only creates cleanup because of her naked scenes ?? The character itself is an absolute bore, and the actor rightly sees it. For those who manage to hold onto the film right to the end, there is an unusual scene with some deadly rodeo clowns and a violent bull (!), Who, although not very exciting or well done, is at least different from norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing movie in most respects, and once again, a strong novel by the productive author has suffered from the transition on the screen.
