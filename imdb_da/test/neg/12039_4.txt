They prove that the police, when they cannot find the real perpetrators, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexually abusing their children. These films always show the press as a bunch of animals, and the parents come out of court to feed the hunger of the press to humiliate the grief that is being hit. Has no one ever heard of a courtroom back door in these movies? Here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not told and no one hires their results. The police are portrayed as blockheads who do not know what they are doing, and there is always an outside detective, like Ed Asner, who comes late, believes in the parents and solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> Even after the parents' clearing, they are not in the stupid policemen's faces that put them in jail, took their children away and accused them of killing their own child. It looked like I've seen this movie many times before.
