OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this movie worth considering the extremely low budget. First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, they gave two good reasons to see and see I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to see is that much has been filmed just down the road. Now I didn't know it in advance, but I saw an Orange County car brand and said, wow! This was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the feedback to the past and the ancestors of the young child, but it really was. The Greek's murder was bad, except for the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but Return of the Living Dead will give you more excitement.
