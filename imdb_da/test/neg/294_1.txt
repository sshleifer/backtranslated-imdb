I do not want to disturb to mention any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on the road to turmoil. However, the shock to me is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this movie. Erika Eleniak, never something you would call a thespian anyway, seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (during her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost throw a tear. He has always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts, as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies, but if you like martial arts, you may well see it). Here he is a distinction of his former self-confidence, he is older, but does the mercenary and does not even look interested. I do not understand it. Don't invest these people? William Forsythe is another "heavy" that I have always wanted, but his last several roles are what you would call "mailing it in". I will not even mention Mr. Reynolds - his concert here is a throwaway, no more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, who is usually a creepy, wicked, pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you look for laugh. There is nothing else about it.
