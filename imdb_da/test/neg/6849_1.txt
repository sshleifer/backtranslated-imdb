To really appreciate this movie you had to be there (actor?) Or have been a crew member. Yes, I am "Selena" and in the mature age of 42 there are serious doubts about what we did / did. <br /> <br /> It all began to be like a "John Waters" type of thing, friends are doing badly in bad movies. Somewhere along the line, fun was interrupted, people who were friends were no longer talking, and BAD was getting worse. I'm sorry about the bad picture I might have projected. (Try to fit the size of a gold spandex pants) <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie sucks so badly, I wouldn't even get my mom to see it. <br /> <br /> To my instructor, cast and crew I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can't we all get together? <br /> <br /> It's been over fifty years , people !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
