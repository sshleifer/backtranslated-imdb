who has thought of having successions to the Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a great movie to watch. Although it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a meaningless plot and can be used to cure insomnia. I didn't even disturb seeing Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R-Class, I assume it's more violent than the last 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most in-line successor. Lou Gossett Jr. will return as the always lovely "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill out Doug Masters role (Canadian Jason Cadieux, resembling Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (Here comes a possible spoiler) ..... Wasn't Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The authors must have been desperate for a story, so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest performed by all the Iron Eagle films. Why do movie producers find it necessary to make followers of uncomfortable movies? (eg Police Academy film). I have always seen Gossett Jr.'s work in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last of Iron Eagle's successors. Let it rest in peace.
