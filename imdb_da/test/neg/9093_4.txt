I really couldn't get into this movie. The reason is that some old women have tortured someone for so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is back in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind due to an accident caused by the father. Anyway, this guy in the basement, who for all rights must be long dead, is still around. He eats a cat and is now superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets blamed. I don't like movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you're always here the typical lines "I didn't do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah blah. And family history can be a lifetime film story.
