OaCD, YCSF was in the production of otter and otter material chosen for musicalization in an effort to keep an eye on the frequency of youthful audiences as the 70s approached. Here it is past life regression, ESP and hypno-therapy ... beautiful loopy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) is the extraordinarily low dramatic efforts; right where can a movie go, and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl, can he not stand? It can't go anywhere new, but strange, it can't even go anywhere! In fact, if it could, the audience would still have some interest in the association of Yves Montand (playing a much older, arrogant, French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We are never invested in them, their situations or results. Montand is miscast, and his strong accent makes many of his texts incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> It has all been given a shallow 60's veneer, making it a unique disposable; despite efforts here and there from Minelli, which is respectable. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any past success ... it's just to watch out! Streisand occasionally has some fun shops, such as when she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she relies on her intrusive (translation: annoying) kooky, Jewish girl shtick. However, she can sing very well in both the "gentle" and "powerhouse" end of the series. In the midst of a score of musical dross she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * of much higher caliber than what Fanny or Dolly had to offer. "He's not you" is a sweet little as sublime as Lorenz Hart's 'My Funny Valentine', but the movie is unable to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics do not seem to refer to anything in the film, and nothing at a distance suggests that a great love flourishes between Chabot and Melinda. The only cut we can see is a poor hatchet job of a much larger movie. Strong research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative but not necessarily a better movie at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there are more Babs in that version, but more importantly, there would be more thoughtful work from Minelli. <br /> <br /> Finally, Montand sends Babs off to sing the title song after she discovers he is a total cock that gives her a self-esteem homily to allow herself from the hook. And she takes bait. So, uh ... listen. <br /> <br /> (* Hurry up, it's great up here, Love with all the trimmings, he's not you and the title song)
