Whether this adaptation of the Marvel comic book was made? and shelves ?? So its production company could retain the copyright of the characters, it does not change its complete nonsense. Dr. Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a loss of either cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can't even point a camera on things without including such howlers as a blind woman's POV, the dialogue is completely bleak, the team's costumes don't fit properly, and the effects are terrible: Human Torch seems to be drawn on the film with felt tips while Mr. Fantastic's forces are brought to life by using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly raising his arms, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit different levels of horrible, and while it's hard not to apologize for all those guys who believed this movie would get a release, it is just as hard to imagine any of those who think it was actually good.
