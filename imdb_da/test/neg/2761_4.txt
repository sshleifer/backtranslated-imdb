I have read many books in my short lifetime but this is by far the WORST !!! I just finished reading this worthless piece of waste, and when I finished it, I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me explain the reasons! 1. The soldier dies Why should the author die? Why couldn't she have kept him alive as a good love story writer would? I deeply welcome Patty to try to complain about the FBI agent's eyes. <br /> <br /> 2.Ruth gets fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) gets fired and without apparent reason too! She tried to comfort Patty, and then Patty's SOB father beats the guy for no good reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and grandparents too! 3rd perm. Yes. That perm. Now you might think, why would it disturb you? Now here's why. Patty's mother asks the girl if she wants the hair done. Patty says no, but her mother calls Mrs Reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a cover. Why would she do it on God's green earth? Why does a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm, just to get her a perm anyway! The mother always pretends that Patty has an impression when she has nothing to say !!! She was supposed to get "The Worst Mother of the Year" for the things she doses to Patty. Thank goodness, Ruth cut her away! 4. Discrimination, Racisem and Prejudious. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know that in those days black was free but in principle had no rights but come again! Why teach today's children the word! It just teaches them how to discriminate people. Not only were black discrimination, but also the Chinese. The book refers to Mr.Lee (a Chinese man) as "The * beep * It is really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis. I hate the city to spit on a little girl, mistakenly for her taste Anton "She is a 12 year old groom! It was just a crush. Like a 12 year old, can really love a 22 year old. Come on! This is not" Lolita. "And" Lolita "is a good book not a piece I am surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita" is. <br /> <br /> 5. Patty goes to a reformer Patty should not have the receptors are for thieves and murder, not innocent 12-year-old! The teacher or what she was called Patty, an ungrateful, spoiled abruptly. The kid abruptly spoiled my ass! Patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never had Patty to have community service or anything. , she just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortisem The parents played favoritism with their c hildren. Early-born daughter is clearly the least favored, while Sharon, the five-year-old brat, is their favorite daughter. The father says he was going to take Sharon to Hollywood, but he clearly looks forward to his second daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. Danger. I hated him! He was so strange Patty could just as well have Hitler himself as his father. Her father beats her without apparent reason, and the way he talks to her eventually will make you so angry that you get caught thinking "Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> There you have the people. 7 reasons I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "Anne Frank's Diaries" or something else because I warn you, it's very depressing and it will leave you really upset! The only reason why it will be 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and grandparents!
