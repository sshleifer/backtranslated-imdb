A very, very, very slow moving, speechless film about a worried, driving young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, almost half went out. <br /> <br /> Attempting artiness with black and white camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the play was poor and the plot and lines hardly existed. Very little music or something to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that continues to run through the head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two salesmen before they find the album. The sweet scene gave promise, but it went downhill from there. The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning ... If it is about emptiness, it works because it's empty. The waste two hours.
