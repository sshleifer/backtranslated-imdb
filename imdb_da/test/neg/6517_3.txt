This movie is about the meeting between 7 couples at Hampstead Heath on a sunny day Wednesday afternoon. It shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking up a relationship, gay, older, blind date and escort service. They are not interconnected except for the geographical location, so it is a disappointment. The movie is a collection of conversations without any clear plot. The movie jumps from one pair to another without any logic. I find this movie boring and pointless. The only redeeming feature is the good weather throughout the film. It's sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are wasted by this movie.
