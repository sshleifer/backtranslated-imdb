I am very disappointed because I expected a real trip as promised in the many reviews. The script is very poor with many holes and the direction too. The director completely failed to develop every violent scene of excitement and excitement. It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. Therefore, I had to see how each ball was used without giving me meaning. I always asked what kind of movie I was watching. Then I did not like that she aggressively smoked a cigarette after another, but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I can't understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role in her life. Jodie, therefore, I liked the PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen. 10.4.
