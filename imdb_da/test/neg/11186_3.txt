OK, it's a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar, shocked people and was banned. I give it that, and therefore I gave it a 3 rather than a 1. It may have been ahead of time, but it is definitely the way behind the time now. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. The short one was captivating with a creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring - just a self-indulgent piece of pompous film making simply created a faint attempt to try to perform Un Chien Andalou by creating a full-length movie (and shamelessly exploiting Dali's name and fame even though he had little to do with it). Total junk except for (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of dull non-action. Waste of time and money. Both my thumbs are down, down. It will go on my shelf, never to be seen again.
