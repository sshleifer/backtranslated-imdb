My boyfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how praised this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this must be good o 'drama This movie had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything was paced was very good. But when the film ended, I couldn't help asking myself if this story was really worth making a movie for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I couldn't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in the movie actress, but again I just found it hard to have sympathy for his character .... he just came out mainly as an idiotic, hotheaded lover of a gangster ... who had no room in "life" initially. How did he get in touch with Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway ??? This movie left me with a dull but troubled feeling ... what was the big deal with this movie? I did not feel completely at Bugsy. Beatty's antics, though worked quite well, seemed just too random and illogical. I guess how Siegel really was .... but it was just too much of it. There just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. My basic assessment of it would be <br /> <br /> "A giant, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of" Las Vegas ".... but his failed attempts The casino he is building with no regard for his bully's money causes him to be killed. <br /> <br /> What's more, I just didn't see the big deal with this and it was a big disappointment There may not be many movies to come out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 Oscars, is beyond me (though the two won are justified) 1.5 / 4 stars.
