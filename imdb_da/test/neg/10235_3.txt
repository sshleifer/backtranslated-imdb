Carole Lombard stars in this transitional film. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (First practical sound film was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, appearances in this movie tend to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. The viewer can easily notice that the actors still "work" for a silent movie, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly serious dialogue (It seems most likely that a diction-elocution drama trainer was widely employed To teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), create some rather comical scenes that should not be comical at all. <br /> <Carole Lombard's later great-acting ability is anything but unrecognizable under all the broad gestures, melodrama and eager gravity. <br /> <br /> Essentially interesting as a historical curiosity during the period, and for it is totally unintentional comedy camp value.
