Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is such a private Snafu card that aims to emphasize the Censor's importance in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu tries to get words out to his girlfriend that he should be stationed in the South Pacific, but the censor feels every attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the invisible censor picking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The other half of the comic, where Snafu manages to send the letter using Technical Fairy, First Class (who actually teaches him a lesson), is less fun and climax with a disappointing one-dream final. The main point of this part of the comic book is the appearance of Snaft's extremely sticky boyfriend, even seen with bare chest, though with strategically placed limbs at all times! Snafu shorts aimed at the military were often characterized by increased weakness, but these scenes, which are curved as they may be, are by far the most erotic I have encountered in any of these shorts so far. In spite of all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go to the jug a little more, which usually results in the protagonist's death. For good examples of this, search for Tashlin's' The Goldbrick 'or Chuck Jones' Spies. 'Censored' is relatively weak by comparison.
