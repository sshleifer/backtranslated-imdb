I say this. If you want to see art, go to an art gallery. If you want to watch a movie, go to a theater. Trying to mix art and film is disastrous in "Where the Heart Is". An interesting cast is completely wasted in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner" because his character here is a horrible embarrassment. In fact, this whole production is embarrassing. Sure, the human artwork is exciting for a few minutes, so make a card, but don't expose an audience to effortless nonsense, masking as busy entertainment. - NOTE
