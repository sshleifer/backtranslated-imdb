The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmographers ever to the mercy of the screen. James Wong Howe. This remake is abominable. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing of value here and it is a pity that this product has the same title as the brilliant original. Only the protagonist's name, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. I'm amazed that Rod Steiger attended. It may be the only bad movie he ever made. Maybe he needed the pay slip.
