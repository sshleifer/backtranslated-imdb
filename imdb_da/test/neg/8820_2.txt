It is always interesting to watch a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. My expectations for this movie were much higher than my view. Children should not play with dead things is a movie with a well-planned plot that goes up too many times to accomplish it. The whole idea of ​​a band of actors who made a dead body recovery had fascinated me. Yet, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. The actors, who were mostly competent and incredibly expressive, were offered roles that did not master uniform characterization. Some of these characters go from ambivalence to the whole act of decaying a cemetery, to scary criticism, back to ambivalence. It's a thing for characters to get a heart of change during the movie; It's another to produce an excessively dynamic circular attitude that runs every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another inconsistent element of this movie is the premise. Does the protagonist intend the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually put up with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? Even with the above errors, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans as I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. The scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely accommodating (also to a veteran's zombie enthusiast) by the superbly combined use of scenery and sound and the vast selection of skilled actors chosen to play the revived dead. Current filmmakers must learn from CSPWDT to use the right video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are a zombie film completionist like me, you should take the time to find and watch this movie. It's a fun watch.
