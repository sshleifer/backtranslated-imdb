This movie should be the worst movie I've seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (movie of the week). Continuity was all wrong (palm trees in Chicago, though filmed in Toronto, Canada). The effects were left to be desired for 2004. HELLO. The "ringmaster" had better CGI than that. But I suppose they also had the money for it. The budget will certainly affect the outcome, but anyone calling this MOW more than 2 must go back to the film and television school. Next time remember that care and time does not make a classic rush for a tornado office or television smash hit. <br /> <br /> I also know that networks can reuse recordings from old networks or branches, but using 80's recordings for 2004? I have a hard time buying it.
