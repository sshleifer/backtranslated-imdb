This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a gentleman'. There is no chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays her love interest. The dialogue is wood, the situations chopped. It's too long and the climax is anti-climactic (!). I love USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much to recruit, I fear. Scripture is formal but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that was not his fault? Costner is furious with the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is as deep as a mud pile. I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I was worth my money.
