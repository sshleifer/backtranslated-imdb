I own a vacation lake home not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from Gein property to be precise. I have seen his country, the cemetery where he is buried, and where he made his digging, and I have acted in the hardware store previously owned by the Worden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. Ed Gein's true story is so disturbing and eerie, why the creators of this piece of waste decided to make their own story past me. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small, gentle and shy man. It's part of what makes his story so scary. He did not have a helper to dig up the grave, and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with little dirt in it. You won't break much of a sweat digging a hole. They didn't have to hire an actor with the body of a wrestler, just do your research. And if the writing wasn't bad enough - there are no mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure 911 wasn't available in 1957.
