I have undergone less painful surgery than the time I spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you give it a try to think that it's going to be something in a Guy Ritchie girl's vein ..... Think again! The production, the dialogue, the action, the script, the film work and the plot were the worst I have ever seen in a movie. My fave part in honesty was the closing credits. Throughout the cinema's history there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and go out and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Have root canal work done instead of wasting your time and money on this!
