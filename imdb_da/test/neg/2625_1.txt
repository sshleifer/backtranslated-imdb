I was forced to see 'Changi' last year in 10 Australian history. Looking around in the classroom, both classes, almost all 40 students slept almost all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that because I am only 16 that my opinion does not count after studying World War Two, I did not just feel embarrassed and ashamed to look at this Australian piece of waste system. I was out of my mind about the horrible action this mini-series used in the use of movie elements. The action was poor, the manuscript was very inaccurate and the score was terrible. Please do not see this movie, it is bias and very racist (to the Japanese).
