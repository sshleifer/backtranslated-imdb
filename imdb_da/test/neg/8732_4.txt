Rock Hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds, Embryo is a movie that combines elements of Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion into a rather strange movie about missing a better word a test tube baby growing up to be Barbara Carrera. </ Hudson is a scientist experimenting with organic development and getting a chance to experiment first with his own Doberman pincher when accidentally hit by his car. <br /> <br /> Some dog pituitary secretions are given to a premature puppy and it grows remarkably to an adult. Impeded by his success, Hudson takes a fetus from a dead victim and gives it some of the same things. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And she develops physically and intellectually at an amazing rate. What she doesn't do is develop emotionally. Still Hudson survives her as her new research assistant to friends and family as sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son John Elerick and son-in-law Anne Schedeen. <br /> <br /> Embryo does not investigate any of the real problems in this kind of science, it exploits them instead. The special effects they are are pretty much different. Hudson looks as if he lost interest in the project about half way through the film. Now what would really have been interesting is if he had a child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero. Now it would have been something Rock Hudson could have sunk into.
