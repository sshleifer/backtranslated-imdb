I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and see them every few months. I lend them to colleagues and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality Japanese filmmaking. I think Takashi Shimizu created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four installments. I was a little excited about The Grudge 2 opening in theaters. I saw the first American grudge before I saw the four originals. Grudgen was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween scare from the American American Grudge. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 started poorly and went down from there. I was waiting to get better, to make sense, to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like this happened. What is good about Shimizu's Ju-on work is the story. True, it is usually told in a disagreeable style that you have to think about connecting its components, but it is still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about. <br /> <br /> Editing was horrible. Disjointed (as in the Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete coincidence of the scene sequence was exhausting. I just kept thinking, "This is so stupid" and "No - he hasn't really sold out this much, did he?" It made me go out of the theater, drive home and see the original work, just to assure myself that Shimizu has not always made this dumbed-down, generic, boring, non-sensual, thrown-together tripe. /> <br /> If you really have your heart set on watching this movie, I suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people in the theater with me walked about 45 minutes into it. I discussed whether I should do it myself. Going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that time. I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. Let's ask Sam Raimi to put no more money into making The Grudge 3. It's just not worth it anymore. Sigh.
