I'm a big fan of Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still has a place in my top 10 game list over time! The story was new, fresh ... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on ... or so I thought ... Farcry the Movie is no less than another director's attempt to cash in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). The video game begins when the player (Jack Carver) awakens in a sea side cave after being shot by his boat of an RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication unit where (Harlan Doyle) leads him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations, and VOLCANOES, to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the fighting fighting mutant super soldiers and genetically enhanced animals. <br /> <br /> The movie plays very, very differently: 1: There is an unwanted 30 min (1/3 of the movie) of the "backstory" before we even get to the "boat's blow-up" scene. 2: Jack then goes on the beach, kills some goons and then drives ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end ... 4: "Modified Soldiers" resembles albinos with singlets on. .. And there were no mutated 'monkey-like' creatures jumping out of bushes. Part of the Farcry game, I enjoyed very much ... 5: There are no sun-drenched beach scenes, no airline, no communication stations on big rocks, LITTLE reference to game content (signs / items / vehicles), in fact no attempt to Follow the story line at all. 6: The climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is a final scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily ever ... WHERE! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer, you will HATE this movie will your whole soul. It's a movie that is clearly meant for men, so girls stay away ... So if your husband, 12-29 years old, never played Farcry and not confused by the directors' attempts to transport books / games to the cinema. .. so it is for you ...
