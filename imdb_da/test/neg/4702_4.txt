Five years after the American civil war, Western people are more concerned about the old war between homesteaders and cattle carriers. Cattlemenne occupies their goods, from Texas to the track town of Abilene, Kansas. There, the cowboys not only find big money, but also big confrontations with homesteaders. Far in the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (like Dan Mitchell) is trying to keep peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience in mediating between grooms and salon brokers. He also juggles the city's finest-looking women: sexy salon singer Ann Dvorak (like Rita) and beautiful church lady Rhonda Fleming (like Sherry). Boozy County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than sharp shooting assistance. <br /> <br /> "Abilene Town" begins with a promising symbolism and contrast: Gunshots interrupt Scott and Ms Fleming sings a hymn in the church; Then the camera switches to Mrs Dvorak sexually and sings her salon number, causing a man to shoot his gun in joy. Then it really becomes a standard western; It is somehow obscure than it should be, but not quite terrible. Young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. Dvorak's leggy costume is the movie's greatest asset; in it she is a real mover. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (1/11/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
