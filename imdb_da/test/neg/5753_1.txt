This game is a beautiful First Person Shooter. ----------- Hang on ...... <br /> But of course a story has to be made about this genre, so a rather innovative plot about soldiers now driven of drugs To save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is the chosen drug that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, just give us some fun, challenging missions, slap some amazing new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be run in our spare time, and I will be completely satisfied. <br /> <br /> NO! <br /> <br /> The manufacturer of this game decides to create a propaganda, military-driven game that tries to make sense of our fear of terrorism and embrace democracy. The game has twisted ideals that just repeat the moral that we learned when we were in elementary school, there is nothing new that is told to us, but "drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then pushed in a type .... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the fleet) of how to stand up for the common good, given ranger on normality and abnormality, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOOOOD WE GET IT! Let's kill something! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can't, you're forced to endure extremely long gaps in completing BULLSH! T goals like "Run to helicopter" ....... "Go to group of troops" .. ... So when this is finished ......... CINEMATIC takes over ....... .. You sit there for at least half of the game and see a little scenario played out of the characters you are you CANNOT skip, but wait, sometimes when people don't even talk, we are waiting for a helicopter lands! Poor game, of a ridiculous group of programmers! Don't make another one because I'd rather watch the movie!
