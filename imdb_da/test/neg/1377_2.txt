Carlos is perhaps not the most original cartoon, but the first series was entertaining, his direct comments and observations were fresh. I missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of stealing material, I caught a few episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. A bit of a change I see! Carlos is much more in toilet humor and sex jokes than ran observations. In an episode, he was implicated that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think. Perhaps Comedy Central will give him another season, but episodes that I saw sounded tired and same-hearted with more words than Osbournes. Carlos, go back to stand-up for a few years, get some fresh material and try again.
