One thing I have noticed about British horror films from the 1970s is that they do not stop repeating the shows THEATER OF BLOOD is a case in point, like any Amicus anthology film. Add BEAST IN CELL to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the drama in this movie is about building a plot of revelation at the end. When you know what the revelation is, this becomes a pretty flat movie. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we are treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies who make small talk. Correct me if I am wrong, but how many people see a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies doing small talk? The only kind of interest found in THE BEAST IN CELLAR is the anti-smoking state. Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military movie, but beware, and you will see that every time a squad is lit for a flight, he is killed. Just odd considering attitudes to smoking were almost as hysterical as they are today
