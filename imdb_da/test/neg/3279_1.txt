The play was bad and the plot, well I don't think there was one. <br /> <br /> Some cool blonde chaps that are always dressed in a dinner kidnap some kind of from a nightclub, I think he then kills a copper. meaningless battles then happened The kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat, why? Tough uncompromising martial arts trained politician, speaks poor English and does things that don't make sense. Its complete tripe. But he has a good car. christ on bike, this movie was a waste of 90 minutes.
