Are you kidding me? This is possibly the worst amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the play was worse than terrible, and I was sorry that the guy at the picnic speed read his plate filled with food, was somewhere meaningless, and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew was no longer than comic. When I hire Bell Witch, I would believe. I read a little literature about it and thought it sounded like a plausible story. But this movie just ruined it. Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc.) Takes a little too seriously and I think he gives a little more credit than he deserves .... Do yourself a favor .... skip this .
