First of all, let me make it clear. This movie is a real piece of waste, but even though it is a real piece of waste, it is a better piece of waste than it could have been. It could have sucked big-time, but it doesn't. <br /> <br /> What this movie didn't have, for example, was scary moments, good acting and a good script. It wasn't very entertaining either. But the movie had cool music, fancy places and hot girls. It also works well as a Dracula spoof. (Hope it was that way, though I really don't believe it) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania and awakens an old vampire who then terrorizes and kills the girls one by one. Sounds good? Yes, it does! <br /> <br /> After reading this, you may think I should have given it a better voice. The reason I didn't do this is because I almost slept in some places ...
