I first heard about this movie on "Flashback Weekend" in Chicago 2007 for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund really spoke the movie and he was great in his part of "Hatchet". The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing this is a low budget first-time instructor / writer, it delivers as much as the big budget and also cameo the "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-imagining. <br /> <br /> Technically, it falls short in a few places. Alligator attacks looked were too dark. When that happened, the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamped on the black pants almost invisible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and can, like a bad sitcom. And like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course, the killer shoots only a pause button for the killer. The end, as soon as I saw where it went, I knew what would happen, not so original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we had to meet the people and care about what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the leader of "Spiral") sulking lead and Marcus ("Not Another Teen Movie") as the best friend and fun man to fight for during the film. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family" movies) give a horrible reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs Permatteo played TV regulators (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo "Step by Step"), as the older couple you know are not the chance, even the guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a bit out Grade. I hope to see more from everyone involved in this movie, but I think it will play better on home video than in the theater, sorry.
