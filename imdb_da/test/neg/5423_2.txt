At all looks, this series could have been made some time since the mid-eighties. The dad's set, the moon king with lightning bolt sewn on their aprons you know drilled. This is a Rocky Jones adventure that holds the space police relationship to the unbearable Bitch Queen of Planet Offeecious, a commie planet that doesn't come to the United Planets. When the noble messengers announce, for intergalactic reasons, that Offeecious is on a collision course with this second, weakly Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow up the other guys rather than evacuate her land. This introduces a morality to the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in its country, but its people", which hammer home five or six times in the climax festival. BQ's constant nasal ranting of "OffEEEEcious" provides relief from some seriously missed space effects, is this a TV show?
