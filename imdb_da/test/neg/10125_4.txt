I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. However, RH3 was a re-hash of the first two without charm or humor. I think I might have been due once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this movie, and his character did not seem to have any purpose other than bungling everything in the most annoying way. Chan is always sympathetic, but he seemed tired in this movie. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was who the girl was (SPOILER ALERT), who the good guy was wild, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate efforts but not in more Rush hour-successors. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental but not a purchase.
