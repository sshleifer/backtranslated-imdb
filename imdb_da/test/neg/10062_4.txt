When the movie's start is Paleontologist Donald Sutherland arriving at the Argyle family's house, it turns out that he is the undeniable alibi of one of the members executed to murder his mother two years ago, your feeling that you are about to see a top thriller; An innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around. But when the film runs together, your disappointment increases inevitably. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a dull and sometimes boring movie that doesn't increase at any time. Nothing interesting happens all the time, and even the final disclosure of facts lacks surprise and intensity (whether or not you guessed). <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from her good performance in "Ryan's Daughter") just pass their roles and not enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> You won't miss much if you skip this one.
