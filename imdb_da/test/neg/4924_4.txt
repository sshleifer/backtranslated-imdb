Creakiness and atmosphere this movie has, but unfortunately it does the print I have just seen. Raymond Massey gives a laid-back Sherlock Holmes, almost comical, then in early stages in his bathrobe, as he acts for a worker's clothing to investigate the appalling manor of Dr. Rylot (Lyn Harding). What wasn't clear to me was why Rylott would have wished his stepdaughters were dead. If he did not, like Helen (Angela Baddeley), want her to run to get married, he would have achieved the same by having her sent. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities are also huge. After setting an early wedding date with Helen, the fiance is no longer heard from the rest of the picture. The presence of a band of gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner's death gives only a diversion, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, the musical representations of Indian man serve. regardless. <br /> <br /> Athole Stewart competently portrays Holmes' aide Dr. Watson, though he takes something to get used to if Nigel Bruce is more your cup of tea. As Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently threatening, a move that will be used as Holmes' nemesis Professor Moriarty in two later films - 1935's "Triumph of Sherlock Holmes" and 1937's "Mask of Baskervilles". <br /> <br /> With repeated choppiness and an unstable camera, it is surprising that history is no more disturbed than it is. It's integrity generally maintained, even though you stretch a little to fill the gaps. I think it would be my biggest complaint with the movie, as mentally bridged some of the jumpers in the picture turned out to be a real pain in aspen.
