As another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family package. I think you could say this was a decent movie for 1980, but it's super predictable, and the play, apart from Robert Conrad, is generally subpar. The football scenes are nothing special and seem primarily to act as a filler for the film. The movie is very dated now, but a decent remake could probably make this a good movie. But is that really necessary? I think how many "underdog sports teams work together for the big game with the undefeated boys" movies do we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger children if you find it in Copenhagen, but a sports movie buffer finds it lacking.
