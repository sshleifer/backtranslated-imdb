Ten years ago I really wanted to watch this movie at the cinema. But I missed it and then forgot about it. Oh, I'm glad this movie wasn't going to ruin my teenage eyes then. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday, and seriously this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that have had too much attention, like the glorious trailers on TV, and too much money spent on actors and the movie. <br /> <br /> The script sucks and the actor sucks even worse, should I say more? <br /> <br /> Please Hollywood, no more ARNOLD !!
