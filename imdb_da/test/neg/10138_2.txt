Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict pretty much anything that is about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have someone who looks like a real person. I think Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever she's called, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show and she's still stupid. Everyone is stupid! That's my opinion of Reba. Having said all that I can say about this show, I just want to take the next few lines of text by saying what I'm saying right now and doing it until there are 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
