The third film based on Charles Belden's game entitled "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) is targeted generation X-tasy. Twin screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the protagonists than other slasher movies - a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. Paige (Paris Hilton) role was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heirs. She peruses "In Style", striptease boys, chats on a cell and frets over an incredible pregnancy. Her regular routine has been changed without repair. Hilton reached the top of her performance - not so hot - during parody "1 night in Paris" (2004). While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously seeks "lip balm" in her boyfriend (Robert Ri'chard) lap. Finally, the "actress" atones to use the "N" word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra shapes his take on the twins as opposed to the past theme. Each exhibited opposite characteristics then, while a couple can either go well or badly into the womb today. But the latter does not exclude the former. Birth constitutes the happiness of a tie. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a modern Quasimodo. Admittedly, the recluses share some similarities such as art, disfigurement, submission and murder. But a small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even more ugly on the inside than he is on. Collet-Serra's "House of Wax" celebrates actress Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves the obvious van Gogh-puns to the public's imagination. But the choice between splitting the antagonist into two eliminates a living twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up, but the most scary in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in "Opera of Phantom" (1925). As for the new participant, the aftermath of the separation surgery concerns the effect. A surgeon should know that they are operating on Siamese twins - physically and psychologically. Their father will call a couple of colleagues - dr. Phil consulted and dr. McNamara to nip / tuck. Despite what the trailers said, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
