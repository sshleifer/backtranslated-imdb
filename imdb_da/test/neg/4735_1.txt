If you're a fan of one of the two franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or didn't like the AVP flick in 06) you'd hate this movie. The countless plot holes, flakey and incredible human characters, horrible special effects and even worse steering and fighting scenes make this the worse movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the HUNDRED big plot holes included Pred / Alien hybrid goes from chest burster to full-grown bad-ass in seconds (it starts on an onboard Predator ship killing spree and dries out a ship of preds before the ship itself breaks the ground circuit.) As if. In the first AVP we saw a ship of Sr. Pred-hunters dropped out of three youth hunters on a "serving their stripes" hunting party, and finally saw them retrieving the "honorable body" of the young people who were left at the end of the girl. We are expected to believe that the individual breast brush hybrid killed all of these Sr. Hunters before the ship even broke the track? Also (and this was extremely inexpensive production value on the director / manufacturer's parts) jars and jars and jars of face scrapes somehow appeared magically on the Pred ship, although the entire temple complex and queen Alien were destroyed in the AvP girl. These face-huggers end up playing an intrigal part in movies ... of course. And what about all these face scrapers becoming adult foreigners in days? What a joke. Although there were many many more plot holes, I don't think IMDb would appreciate filling my servers by writing them here. On the flakey and incredible characters, where should I go boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all of these goofballs are clich√©s from other movies or TV shows. The town of bad-boy who left to avoid jail time, but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see it? Oh yes last season at JERICHO !!! Then there is 20 something city sheriff (a former problem solver himself) who were best friends at once with the bad boy. Where did we see it? Oh yes, Jericho and Walking Tall! Then the generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) comes home from some generic war fronts that are not met as a long-lasting loved one and entirely at the airport or bus station, but in his own front page by her daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did she do in Army / Air Force / Marines / Navy / Coast Guard? We do not know because the film NEVER counts the US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was a kind of soldier / airman / Marine / sailor / coasty who knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry vehicle and ... magically ... A HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a generic copy of every "upcoming home" service person ... except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles for her daughter who costs several hundred dollars. These are things soldiers must sign for and not just "bring home." UGH! <br /> <br /> The special effects and battle scenes are what made me the worst. These are the things I enjoyed most in the first movie ... see Preds and Aliens go on it! The way this was filmed was the action sequences so dark and filmed so close that you couldn't tell what was going on. You couldn't see who did what and what was going on when they fought it out. All in all, these hundreds of objects will kill this franchise and fanchise. No one is going to worry more about watching their favorite sci-fi movie monster, and can only guess that the series will go down from here as manufacturers will not dump millions of dollars more into a sequel.
