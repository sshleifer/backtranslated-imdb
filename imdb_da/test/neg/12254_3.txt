Although this should be nadir for season six, this schmaltzy episode is not badly written or acted. It's just that most of us looked at the X-Files for tight, poignant horror / thrillers, ending with no easy response and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of heavy-in-cheek comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and frankly made the Simpsons Halloween Specials resemble great thriller TV. In this episode, Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-standing boyfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker. But her weather master is the one who really loves her, and Mulder wins out giving him the advice to get out of town. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of fun with chemistry between the agents and some entertaining but no overly sophisticated characterization of Midwestern hicks. It's not something you'd like to see more than once! It's hard to find out season 6. The X-Files creator Chris Carter seems to be bored with the entire Syndicate conspiracy arch and leave the responsibility to black comedy writers.
