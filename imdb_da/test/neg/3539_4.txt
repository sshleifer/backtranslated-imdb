A 'Wes Craven presents' 1995 film, directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists rescues a dying man from their desert-stricken government post by injecting him with their experimental virus. Of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus turns the man into an almost unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. Lance Henriksen plays the moral abusive researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man. (First unstoppable death machine mutation). Deciding to combine two trips into one he brings his family with him (they go on vacation afterwards) and continues to give them access to the top secret government facility, thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos. If you can't tell, this depends on the viewer to work a little with it and put some petty (see: big and blatant) details. <br /> <br /> Overall: Watch stand with mild bits of pleasure. Note: Outpost is commonly known as 'Mind Ripper'
