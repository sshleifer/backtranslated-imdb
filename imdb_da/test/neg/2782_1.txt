I knew well when I rented this DVD that it might well be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen would be to put it lightly. I wonder if there are no legal actions that can be taken against the people who allowed this movie to produce. I think the funding should come from somewhere someone had to spend money on this to be produced !! ?? <br /> <br /> I wanted to find more production values ​​that led to the error of this movie, but this movie violated every production standard in the universe. I couldn't make it through the whole movie when I started to get dizzy with the horrible shooting techniques. Neither can I tell you how many scenes I just finished zoning under because of the inexplicable horrible dialogue. I feel like I've been permanently scarred for life. If you've seen this movie before you get this warning, think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who saw this monstrosity.
