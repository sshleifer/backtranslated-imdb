You can put a model airplane on a black background and call it sci-fi, and that's enough to get me interested, so if you are, Black Horizon will at least get you interested before you see it. The best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The movie plays as the Naked Gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clich√©s and bad plays. Unfortunately, I do not think they should be funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so just have to laugh at them and not with them. <br /> <br /> On one side note, it is rare to see a movie half-done in outer space, half on the ground, and not interfering with the expected aliens and supernatural events. I really do pain for more realistic drama based on our space efforts.
