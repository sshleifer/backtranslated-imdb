I mainly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie was not about trying to be single after making a covenant when one of Jerry O 'Connell's friends got married. The other friends put this money together and who ever gets married gets the money from all their friends. Anyway the movie just try to follow through by doing no page and trying to make it more fun then doing the page. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie. It was not good at all. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
