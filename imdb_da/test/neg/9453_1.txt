One of my friends loves tacky horror movies, so I often see low budget things like this. However, this is the first time I've been forced to write a review of a ... <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Even worse than Boggy Creek II! The entire budget of the movie seems to have been spent on a short scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber and turns all the vampire ish. The only good thing to say about it is that it was fun after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
