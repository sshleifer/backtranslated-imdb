Two films: "the fifth element", "armageddon". The same topic: Saving the world. The same main player: Bruce Willis. A difference: "Armageddon" is much inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects fail to save a working and globally conventional manuscript. Several parts of the movie show it. I think of the President's speech and especially Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace". At the start of the film, he tends to neglect and over-protect her, and it makes her tired. So at the end of the movie it is true love and understanding that shines in him. On the other hand, the movie falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie tries to be fun, but the result doesn't seem like the humor introduced in the movie is often raw and rather low, while in the "fifth element" humor was very involuntary and could ignore the serious side of the action. The movie suffers from two other disabilities: it often falls into the ridiculous (the Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are badly used. Bruce Willis is the opposite of his "fifth element" character. He plays the cock, he pours it up and sometimes he is unbearable. The other players are hardly credible in their own roles, especially Willis' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here just to have fun. One of them is taken to be highly qualified, but he looks like a fool. And poor Tyler! She's on NASA just to be fancy. <br /> <br /> When released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis exclaimed tired of saving the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
