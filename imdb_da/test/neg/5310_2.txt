The movie, while it was a bit flawless, was quite entertaining. About half an hour in Be Cool, I started having Hollywood Homicide flashbacks. But guess what? This is worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie so it makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it, but I feel obliged. The Rock, Second 3000, and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide which movie genre they acted on. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. He was quite consistent in the role, but this film is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a tender thumb. I was supposed to give this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much, but there is a conversation in the movie about a particular song that is so asinine, I couldn't believe the artists actually said it. If you want to go to the cinema at the weekend, there must still be some Oscar contenders out there. It would be a much better way to spend your time.
