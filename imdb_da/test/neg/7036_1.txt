one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely fun (not on purpose though). Every scene that contains something to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting are badly cluttered. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all pilots, it's so bad that you should laugh at some point in the movie (see also Airport 79: Concorde for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except fans of B movies, of course)
