At least if you are a Disney fanatic (good of the variety who loves their live-action movies as well as the animated stuff) if you are a child if you are a child of the heart almost to the point that you are not aware that you are an adult if you absolutely love any movie that contains animals, especially when making tricks, or if you are just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is something entertaining to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I probably enjoyed this movie enough and I would like to see it again. <br /> <br /> But boy has many problems. Main errors stem from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all. In 82 minutes, we adults get married, teens fall in love and try not to be awkward about it, teen love and jealousy competition, preteen's spy game, dogs fall in love, dogs play football, dogs have puppies, manipulative parents, who will do everything to get their children to be taught a lesson of their children, housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and performing elaborate plots. I probably forget something, but there are 10 major plot issues to be addressed with less than 10 minutes per. Thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that is not too complicated - it's a kids' movie - and it's also humorous and heart-warming. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, on his first trip is completely responsible (he has a lot of previous other unit experience), not quite up to the task. I'm sure it didn't help that at least three screenwriters were involved, and probably the producers dictate too. The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely choppy. Events occur with some justification, and worse, often a little explanation. People figure out and do things primarily because they need to - and quickly - so everything can arrive where it should arrive in less than 90 minutes. From a cut to the next, the time can go on for six months or so. We both have adults who may look like they are mentally handicapped and children who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rushing into some unexpected actions. Some of the threads simply had to be removed because it is difficult to get too engaged in the movie as soon as you are introduced to an idea, it has already passed you. <br /> <br /> Also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of one hundred and one Dalmatians (1961), minus a Cruella De Vil sign. And another problem is that considering how the movie is edited, I suppose the dog Air Bud probably couldn't do much with the football. Unlike the first two movies, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it is in very fast flashes; Each time for a while, these excerpts appear to be even supported by computer animation. <br /> <br /> But for someone like me there is a cheesy charm to Air Bud: World Pup. The manuscript and performances are often between ridiculous, hokey and kinda clich√©d. I tend to like that combination. It makes the film a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. And at times, as the end, when the movie completely falls into consistency and basically becomes commercial for the US Women's Soccer Team, Air Bud: World Pup is so obviously sticky that you can't help love it.
