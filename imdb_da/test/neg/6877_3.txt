Here he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe I know. But his time is here. <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. Yes, the antagonist, Ray is a complete dot. This is partly due to the naughty things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But primarily because Ray The Prick has been milked. <br /> <br /> Yep, Ray doesn't channel evil. He doesn't even get cursed, not even with a voodoo spell. No, Ray The Prick has been milked. As DeNiro once said, "You can paint something with nipples". And Ray has been milked. By evil. How do you milk evil you ask? Snake nipples, I answer. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why do you ask Ray? Because he is a dot, I answer. Capital P. <br /> Keep an eye on the New Line Pictures extravaganza entitled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick". Did you think you were the new fear teacher, Jeeper The Creeper? Well no more, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm afraid. However, pity about the atmospheric-less, PG-13, unoriginal workmanlike quality of the movie, because Ray is a star.
