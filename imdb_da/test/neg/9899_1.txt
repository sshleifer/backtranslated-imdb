There have been some great television films in that past. Epics like "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to mind. Category 6: The Day of Destruction will not be remembered to promote the cause of television films. A ridiculously bad story, surpassed only by the horrible script, Cat6DD, which I would like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than terror in nature, which the film should bring out. The sound you hear under the film should be the sound of the wind, but instead it is actually the career of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, from Dharma & Greg duo) who overturn faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was announced as "nature away amok", instead we get a lame story of how 15 different weather systems use to produce 150 degree days in Chicago, so a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the Gulf of Mexico combined with a storm system from Canada, but actually it originated in a jet stream changed by global warming .... NOW !! It didn't matter what the story was, the play was horrible, the words the actors said were stupid, and 13 scientists across the country had coronaries after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were sub-par, even for made-for-TV standards, and the story lines were meaningless. All in all, I really don't like this "TV event."
