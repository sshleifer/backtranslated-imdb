Why is it that the Italians in the 50s and 60s made the best movies, and then in the 70s and 80s you only made zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art film didn't make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike Zombie Movie, created by Americans and used by Italians, is a pure Italian creation designed as a showcase for mondo and earning as much money as possible (no artistic integrity comes in the way here). Eating Living came under Cannibal Movie Softness. Director Umberto Lenzi had not even hit his steps yet; His genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year away. <br /> <br /> In a plot similar (read: ripped off), Ruggero Deodato receives his seminal cannibal classic, Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) a word from the police that they have received an 8mm film from my sister. She has disappeared in Africa, and it is suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as professor in Somethingoranother, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) has started a Jonestown-like cult in New Guinea, and this is where her sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And wouldn't you know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> A phrase should sum it up: If you've looked at Cannibal Movie, you've seen them all, mostly because these movies steal shamelessly from each other (Lenzi copied the Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and retooled this to make Cannibal Ferox; Deodato copied parts of it to Hit and Run). And because they all share the same material, they all have the same features: horrible photography, boring landscape, horrible duplication, overactive and exploitation, exploitation and exploitation. Genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. Rassimov and Kerman have a culinary dining competition. Agren exists solely for being naked, raped or in danger. Much for all the sick out there. The cannibals, which actually appear to be native cannibals, eat lunch measured with hidden as human flesh. And in the great tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown on the screen is usually killed shortly thereafter. Generally, not really a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excitement entertaining. I know I did.
