This movie was really awful. It was not at least scary, or even spectacular. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and at the end of the night we said "The ruins ruined my night." <br /> <br /> I don't recommend watching this movie in theaters, renting it, or even watching the movie on TV by accident. It is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were terribly underdeveloped, and they left nothing historical at all for anything that happened, and then left it completely open at the end as for preparation for a successor.
