If this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, one would have to create a new rating system, as this would not even qualify. The movie's plot is about Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), an ex-special operative agent who is targeted by a man he killed while still working for the US government. If it sounds like an interesting scenario, please be fooled as this movie won't deliver what its action-themed story suggests. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when you see an actor making a bad movie, as you would like to send the actor $ 50, since the actor must be desperate for money to make such poor quality . After watching this movie, you can send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. <br /> It seems that Baldwin didn't put any effort into his role in the movie. In the film, Baldwin is forced to drive across the city of Los Angeles to protect his "gingerbread" (wife) from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed. However, it appears from the whole picture that Baldwin can hardly pull off by maintaining a light jog. His relaxed performance succeeds in subtracting any excitement that the film may intend to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad movies and laughs at their shortcomings than this movie is for you. But if you are looking for a well-functioning action thriller, it would be best to look elsewhere than rent this movie.
