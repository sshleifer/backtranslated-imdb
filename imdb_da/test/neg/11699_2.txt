Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before I saw the movie, but I was very disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common Hollywood style elements. It's also wrong, as this movie has a fantastic cast, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, and the then ignorant Alice Krige. They just aren't given much worth doing. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was all about to go halfway through, but a friend convinced me to stay at the end when he was sure it had to get better. He apologized to me during final credits.
