Is it just me or is it an AWFUL movie? I go with it is an AWFUL movie ... <br /> <br /> I know it's a lighthouse flip (usually defined as full of car gates, crashes, warfare, explosions, etc.), I still expect a little degree of credibility. If I somehow cannot believe in the premise, the movie will not work. Thus, we come to the problem of "Assault on Precinct 13." <br /> <br /> Not one for spoilers, I never report details about the plot. However, I will make an exception here because the plot is so inane. Bad guy is imprisoned in Precinct 13. Bad guy's friends want to bust him out. Surprise. The evil fellows are actually corrupt police. Embarrassing, troubled but heroic young policeman saves the day while he ranks the girl. UGH. Yes, it's really that simple and stupid. <br /> <br /> "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. Not a bad framework for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Still, it is outrageously violent and abusive to the Detroit police and citizens. I've spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can't imagine how the final hunt sank in downtown Detroit Forest. I must have missed it ... <br /> <br /> There is no refund for seeing bad movies. Save your money. There were too many good films in 2005 to waste another $ 3.00 at Blockbuster on this one. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1 <br /> <br /> (Only because I've seen worse movies.)
