Tom Selleck plays an absent son to senile "pop" Don Ameche and tired mother Anne Jackson who settles for his indiscretions (a presumption) and takes them in after Ameche has burned down his mobile home; Meanwhile, Selleck's job is overcome by F.B.I. His assets are frozen, his wife and children leave him, and his unpleasant sister and her brats have come to stay. Brightly-painted comedy-of-ills are as close to reality as Ameche's doddering old coot. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as Ameche's traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a silly second or third version (with Selleck getting poked, bumped, prodded and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!). In any way, it is a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden involvement in his father makes no sense; he hobbles around and howls in pain, but keeps his heart from mush. This movie is mush. * from ****
