The propaganda-pro-American war effort film that came out in 1942 has East Side Kids hard against any Japanese they spot in their own neighborhood as they learn they are too young to lure. Ultimately, they learn that they fail in their distrust of some individuals, but also happen to stumble upon a spy ring, then go out to break. The film is harmless enough in its way, although some may well take offense, given how innocent Asians really got designated during World War II. Overall, it is a beautiful generic effort, and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad lib.
