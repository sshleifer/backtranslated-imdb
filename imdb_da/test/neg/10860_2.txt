Once in a while, Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, he not only makes horrible movies but puts his names on them like this. An allegedly cool retro flashback for biker movies from the 60s and 70s, the new depths of this plumbing. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy it when a blouse falls into a movie more than the next man, but even I felt kind of sleazy watching this. Using a word I never thought I wanted, its msysoginistic (I can't even spell it.) The reason (in the concept of vaguest sense) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones' accent, the fact that his terrible play is not ours Especially a testament is as amazing as one can think of. <br /> <br /> This is just awful. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror
