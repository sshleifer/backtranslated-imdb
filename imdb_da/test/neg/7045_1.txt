Can you believe in a university professor made this movie ????? <br /> <br /> The same man who made DHOOP <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever <br /> <br /> The main message is nice, but it is very bad <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances <br /> <br /> Direction and everything is bad <br /> <br /> Music is okay < br /> Emran's naughty streak works and he does well. Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha's bad Paresh irritates when he looks at the mirror
