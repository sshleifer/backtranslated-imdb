Just saw it .... the story, the plot, the script makes absolutely no sense !! Its conscientious part 2 (without ringing), its sign emerging from the blue (without reason), the Hercules hated by all (no one knows why), its Leelee Sobiesky shows his true talents (two of them), its crappy special effects, some good actors are wasting their talents (i told Leelees two talents ??) ... must i say more ??? I'm just AWFUL, even for NBC TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a waste! by the way: how can you people give this mini series so many stars ????? Its beyond me! .... Shame on you! Must do 10 lines so this is my last word: AVOID, AVOID if you are considering buying it!
