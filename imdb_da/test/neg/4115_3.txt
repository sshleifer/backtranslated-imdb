In a future where an industrial travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time for exploration at the age of dinosaurs, the future becomes inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the main rule of not leaving the path. In an effort to alleviate the damaged damage, an experienced time scout team (Edward Burns) with the invention of the technology (Catherine McCormack). The principle is pretty good and engaging. It may have a few errors in it, but it can still make for an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder doesn't really complain about the audience. It suffers from a number of problems, and it takes too much trouble, so it's hard to actually have fun while watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the movie's biggest problem. They were more plot holes than expected, and the movie was a bit lazy in explaining things. I was hoping for a more in-depth look at the "butterfly effect", but the movie was more escapist fun than anything else. It's okay with me since the 90 minute mindless fun is still a good way to spend an evening. But all the fun this movie was offered was accidental and paralyzed. There were a few scenes that kept me entertained, but I was pretty sorry. <br /> <br /> The action is not much better, as most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else. The only person who gave a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the movie enjoyable, and he also seemed to have the most fun. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and bland. I don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. But he could do for a decent supportive actor. Catherine McCormack was just very annoying and not very trustworthy. I haven't really seen her in anything else, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad performances, although most of them are relatively unknown, so it should not affect their career too much. <br /> <br /> Looking at the message cards, most people complain about the special effects. There is no way to sweeten them and they are terrible. All the dinosaurs look really bad. The Gibbon Lizard (part monkey, part dino), while a creative idea becomes obsolete after a while, and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. The green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. I really wondered which director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He fails to deliver the excitement, action and excitement and makes this movie a long one. For the most part, the movie is rather harmless and is far from the worst movie in 2005. Hopefully they will resume this movie in the future. There is potential in this project, but now it's the best we have. In the end, unless curiosity gets better off you, there is no need to see a sound of thunder. Rating 4/10
