I saw the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar for dollar, that's probably one of the worst movies ever. Now I DO NOT say that it is the worst movie ever - but if you look at a relationship between the cost of how much an average person will enjoy it, it is a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> The only major factor that makes this a bad movie is the author / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much be due to being placed on a single person. Had he not been so self-sufficient, a movie could just as well have been made in about 90 minutes - rescuing the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a completely unnecessary prologue to be assigned to Harvard. The scene is large, but completely without context. You have no idea what happens or do you know why the students (especially John Hurt) behave so boorishly. I find it very difficult to imagine such a beginning in 1870 - and it looks much more like 1970. It's half an hour when you have no idea what happens, who the characters are or their motivation. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard degrees (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) in Wyoming. So they went to the best school in America, and now one is just a lawyer in the middle of no where and the other is .... Well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (prolonged) or a pathetic and pointless drunk that hangs out with murderers - even though he seems to be against them! His whole character had no meaning. They never explained why he was a Brit who lived in the midst of heaven (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he was bothering to come with the hired army if he were so against their evil plan or why he would risk his life for a reason he didn't believe at all. With regard to Kristofferson, his excellent actor and better-defined character made his character more credible even though he moved to Wyoming and risked his life for a prostitute to have no meaning whatsoever. <br /> <br /> This brings the worst aspect of Heaven's Street. While the scenes are far too long and needed to trim, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there, but you have no idea why. In fact, Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (like a hooker with a heart of gold - quite the clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, is entirely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a huge runway built in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult - and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and timber arrived instead of food. Maybe if they hadn't used a bazillion dollar building and frequented the runway, farmers could have offered to buy food and avoid this war over purloined cattle !!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What does this have to do with an earth war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you're left with is that it's a movie, how much, very little actually happens, until the big game late in the movie. There are many scenes of dirt and flat nothing. So much nothing that many of the audience members at the time of the struggle would have left or are now so hostile to the movie that nothing inevitable could save the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. First, this little skirmish was on prairie longer than the D-Day invasion !! Secondly, while details of the actual events in the so-called "Johnson County War" are a bit outlined, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never there when they had both been hung BEFORE the match. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the movie - especially in the last game. Although I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal fats and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. To see and know that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's "vision" for the film is very sad. Finally after the big battle we have an epilogue. While it is blessed short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he finally puts part of the Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one who Kris saw a few times during the proletariat. Most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final result is. I read it myself and found out that the film often got the facts wrong. All in all, to say the movie is long and needs tons, more editing like saying WWII was a "minor tiff". Well, I've certainly seen much worse, but if you factor in the production costs, I really think it might just be one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie has this very explicit nudity, I warn parents. But as a child could not sit through this movie (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.
