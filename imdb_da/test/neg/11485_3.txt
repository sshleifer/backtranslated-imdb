'The Shining' has white, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Ausentes', however, has none of these things; although it borrows from its classic spring; A man chopping through a door and a woman running around screams while crushing a large kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubricy's great psychological horror films, 'Ausentes' is a work that resonates with a unique lack of genius. It's wonderful, comic terrible; It makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art. 'Ausentes' is the story of a family moving to a gated community in the suburbs. Everything must be good with the world. They will live in peace and quiet; They will quietly go about their business away from the old old streets. But no. Ariadna Gill's character Julia begins to be spooked by the things that insist on going into the night, by empty supermarkets and doors that close themselves; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, instantly switches from the dismissed family to the wildly uncut nutter, injecting Julia with a substance to keep her under his sudden cosh. Molla, very respected as an actor, is absolutely horrible in this. Cartoon rather than threatening, he simply cannot pull out a threatening expression. He just comes across as a barroom slime ball that has had a drink for many. Then there is something to redeem this movie? No. The script is lumpy, the plot is non-existent and thrown without profit. Quite without excitement and full of scared now moments, 'Ausentes' is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller. It is ridiculous and overblown, but as one of the most unintentional hilarious films in recent years, it is well worth watching.
