An art teacher crosses an antique wooden bed made of gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a horrible story, and he is chased by an old spirit that maintains its human form by tearing the hearts out of humans. <Br /> <br /> This beautifully crafted horror ?? Well, in fact, it's more fantasy / romance than anything else that raises some chills and gives some amazing visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough, and the formal script lacked any kind of life. The problem was that I spent most of the time holding my finger away from the fast-forward button. It would probably have increased the slow pacing of the movie, but then again I would not know too much about what was going on, which was reasonably hard to figure out or interest in the first place. The performances ranged from too melodramatic or just dull, and this is probably because these characters are convincing, outdated and coma-inducing. The actual back-story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily composed, with too much focus on a flimsy romance, being ridiculous when not to be and generally it is built in a common way that just lacks oomph or conviction of wearing the movie. What compensates for the shortcomings of history are really artificial images that are so big, but the use of some pictures had something dumbfounded for what they actually meant for the movie. What catches your eye is the faded color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen will look really grainy or snowed out. Although it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, but also adds some fine polished effects that fit well with the soothing, but sometimes angular, score. The camera work was quite different (although it didn't add too much to the feature), but in some of the more optimistic scenes there were too many close-ups or dark lighting, making it difficult to understand what you were seeing. Also on the show are some good moments with blood and do, but not overtly big or distinguish from most other films. <br /> <br /> Lethargic odd movies with shining images resembling something out of a painting, but still not very tempting. Beware it can put you in a deep trance!
