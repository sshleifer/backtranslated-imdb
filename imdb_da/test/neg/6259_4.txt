Like the COURSE OF KOMODO was for the creation function genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a fair parody of the slasher film, which SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psycho escaped from his padded cell (... he was sent to loony bin thanks to killing eleven people) working over mountainous backwoods landscape in Bobcat County attacking anyone within his reach. A truck of cheerleaders, their teacher, two equipment hands and the driver are heading for a competition when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a presumed card shot to avoid returning. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin up front, but falls in exchange for a killer who attacks each victim one by one. The psycho who was loose in the county could not have killed a girl because she was in the cheerleaders' wardrobe while he was elsewhere, which means one of them is the culprit. At the same time, the governor's county and his deputy pursue their psychic whereabouts while attempting to locate the lack of cheerleader group. <br /> <br /> Shots cheaply on video, making Wynorski what he can with the limited budget have to find wise ways to murder characters off-screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. In other words, lots of melons were encountered, the sound effect used to tell us that some victims whisked away in the dark by a black gloved hand died savagely. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE regarding Brinke Stevens character Linda, where she is being persecuted by a murderer with a drill (... the murderer and Linda both died, but I suppose Wynorski would link his movie to the one, albeit pretty bad). It was still nice to see her, even though it was a glorious cameo. Tamie Sheffield, whom Mrs Hendricks learns from students in trouble, has a long bathing area in the shower that soaps her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up cheerleaders are a bit convincing because of course they are in their twenties. Aging soft-core pornstars Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer attacked by the psychopath she's looking for) and Nikki Fritz (.. a walkers who are victims of jogging over a dangerous bridge) surprisingly don't have to strip. Wynorski veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (.. as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as a detective helping Murdock with his case) contribute to the subsection of the search for John Scott's serial killer McPherson. Interestingly, the McPherson story serves as a McGuffan when the movie's flesh is actually devoted to the cheerleading group and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the killings to flare up, and when they finally get into the picture, the violence is not strong or shocking enough to satisfy.
