I was hooked on the assumption that the show was about demons. From hell. And a doorway to hell. I did not understand that I would see some guys running around in tunnels followed by small children who may or may not have been demons for the whole movie. Sure there was some dialogue between them, and great underground nature, but the lack of a plot, developed signs, any twists or developments in history at all lacked much. Oh, and without interest there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on the actors' salaries, spending a lot of time running around with a camera underneath. The end was one of the typical lack of boring endings that make you say "I endured this movie of boredom for it !?" If you want to see demons and a door to hell, I promise you would rather benefit from watching the trailers for the Hellgate game: London, which is shorter than this movie in 5 minutes, packs more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfactory conclusions than this. <br /> <br /> The other star is for effort, but generally a low score to refrain from making a film that stands out and too promising in the tagline much more than what was delivered.
