I haven't seen and heard the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning right now. <br /> <br /> I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaria, USA etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to mention: <br /> <br /> In the German sync throughout the movie, all Russians speak with Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Moreover, it is boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. As a cheap edition of a James Bond movie.
