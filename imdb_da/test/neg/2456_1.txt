Greetings to everyone, <br /> <br /> Isn't it amazing, the power the movies have on you after 1st view? <br /> <br /> I was so happy about the first show of this movie, I couldn't stop talking about "Flatliners" to all my friends this week - remember I was a very impressive 18 year old and then my taste in movies has become a bit more conservative since then. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I forgot this movie until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remember how big I was thinking "Right! I'll pick you out of the shelf, when they bring out Special Edition ". <br /> <br /> Last week I was glad my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this movie even more on 2nd view. How wrong I was! Rating: After 11 years, my view of this movie has changed from a very scary 1st class movie to a total junk, as overlay on the religious and supernatural side of things rather shallow. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts's play (except for Erin Brockeridge, where she deserved her Oscar). I think the problem with this movie is definitely with the director and such a mediocre script. I left this movie because it had no real substance or potential, and just a few scarey cheap tensions that weren't very well done at all. Not even scored by James-Newtown Howard, whom I would like to like as a film composer, could catch and span. <br /> <br /> In 1990, I would have given this movie 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 i would be lucky to give it 2/10 at best. <br /> <br />
