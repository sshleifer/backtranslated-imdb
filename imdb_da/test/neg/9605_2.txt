Usually I don't like to waste my time writing comments on junk so that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but when I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the Comcast Showtime channels (346 I think ), I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> In addition to enjoying Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I watched this movie through to the end. I am always amazed that beautiful women are willing to act in horrible movies like this, but I guess she thought this movie would lead to something better. I hope she was right for her sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is an all too typical direct-to-video laugh lift, or just a piece of garbage, according to your point of view. Although there are a few decent moments in this movie, they do not really link well to the story as it is. The set-up, as I recall, involved Carol Everything as a depressed housewife who thinks her husband, a policeman, is cheating on her. There was also something about their child dying in an accident, and she blamed him for it, but before, the story went where she shot and killed him. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him, and almost immediately her house is under siege by government strokes and mercenaries to intercept the stranger who seems to have almost superhuman fighting skills. <br /> <br /> This same kind of material has provided decent entertainment many times before, especially in Matt Damon's Bourne Identity, and could have done so this time too, but this particular movie was let down by poor production values ​​and a miserable script . <br /> <br /> This movie really falls apart at the end when the mysterious alien turns out to be a cyborg (!) programmed to be a policeman and after discovering that Carol's all killed his man, he tries to kill her! The movie wasn't very good at this point, but the end really ruins it by trying to make a modest action thriller for a lumpy Terminator / Robocop wannabe. I also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit exaggerated at the end, with the demented cyborg that knocked out the poor Carol Alt's eye before it finally hit the dust. What was the meaning of that? What is the meaning of something in this movie? It kept my attention and entertained me for about an hour until the end when it reminded me that I didn't see a first class movie. It wasn't even another batch movie for that matter. The final scenes seem to be hinting at a sequel, which I don't think ever happened, even though I didn't carefully check the net for it. Needless to say, I'm not busy seeing any sequel to this movie.
