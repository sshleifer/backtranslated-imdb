Back in college, I studied marketing, and although I missed a lot of classes and never really paid attention, I will always remember the most important and crucial market principle, which is not what you sell; That's how you sell it! This principle is fully applicable to "The Devil's Triangle" as it is basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing, but empty package. Writer / Instructor Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the great inaccuracies, so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to giving a grim atmosphere that the eerie voice tells. Vincent Price and the odds ball of King Crimson. And I guess Richard Winser's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, as there was a huge Bermuda Triangle hype going on in the mid-70s and literally every movie production ?? whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a dizzying exploitation flick ?? Covering the topic earned huge money at the box office. "The devil's triangle" overwhelms you with unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the serious dramatization of facts and of course, the frightening voice of almighty Vincent Price creates an atmosphere of fright and fragility. The story is constantly bouncing back and forth in time, covering a massive amount of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious vanishing" of ships and aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle over almost a century, but the reports remain extremely vague all the time and the eloquent Mr. Price always ends every chapter with the eerie words "" just another unsolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle ?? "After a few cases, the whole formula is simply ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I suppose it caused true mass hysteria back in 1974. The documentary extends a bit more to the most infamous Bermuda Triangle mysteries, like the five flights of flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the unusual case of the ship USS Cyclops, but still in these chapters there is only a minimum of useful information, the cameras never at a time underwater to explore the depth of the Bermuda area, example, and the testimonies of the apparently real testimony of the dramas resemble suspects as staged scenes. For almost an entire hour, it's your chance!
