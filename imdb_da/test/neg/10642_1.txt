Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the sequel's mediocrity in the Hellraiser series really sets in. Gone are the imagination and invention of the first two films. Gone is the stage of Pinhead and his minions. Gone are the human diseases. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been destroyed by this mess on a picture. All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a hell of evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This watered excuse for a Hellraiser movie is padded with endless Psycho Babble so Pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of judgment he is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The movie uses the most basic movie formulas with characters that separate and are individually killed. Pinhead is not Alien. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hell" is never established, it just comes to a victim and sits on a sideboard. <br /> <br /> The leading female character is called 'Rimmer' and the producers of course think it's great fun because everyone continues to say his name. Really, the film should have been retitled to give it the same character. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
