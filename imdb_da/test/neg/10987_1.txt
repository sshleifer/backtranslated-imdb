I hated it. I hate self-conscious pretentious inanity that masks like art. This movie is either stupid or extremely stupid. After the first half hour I quickly got through the DVD version and saw the same young shennanigans again and again. I was angry that I had spent hard earned money on sophomoric clap trap. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not matter a movie, let alone art.
