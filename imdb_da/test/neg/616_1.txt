With several name actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs led? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, like Warner, Baker or even others in the movie as Charles Napier. Combs were miscast in this and did a bad job of it. Everything he did seemed to be false or constructed. <br /> <br /> Scripture is bad. This means that if Lance Henrikson (or someone else) starred, he could have saved the movie (removed it from my "waste of time" category), but it would still have been a bad movie. The screen was completely missing. The director should have recognized this and helped the film together.
