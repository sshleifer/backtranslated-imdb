"Carlito's Angels" is a ghost of "Charlies Angels" who is not afraid to spoof themselves at times, but that does not mean that the film is also over criticism of the viewers - it is amateurish and youthful (I think "fast - exercise "stopped being fun around 1914). The rapping rap music often drowns the dialogue, and the movie feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! The girls themselves are warm and adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and although they never get naked, their clothes leave a little to their imagination. By checking their IMDb pages, I found out that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually going through a movie career; I wish her luck, because even though this movie is bad, she (and the other girls) gave it what it has, and I wouldn't mind seeing her again on the screen.
