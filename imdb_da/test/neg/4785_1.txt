My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... Because I've seen this. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First, how is this considered so high? I do not understand. This "show" is filled to the top with either annoying people, stupid people or simply unlikeable. "Gags" are hideous. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode where Earl's brother's wife wrapped and washed away dead fish. Don't be kidding. It wasn't fun, it's horrible. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid), then she had sex. I almost threw up. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the most desperate attempts of long-time comedies. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but caught in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy". Earl is now in jail for this current season. Let's hope he gets the chair, so this show gets out of that misery. <br /> <br /> The last word: This show would be fun for people who think Larry Cable guy is fun. To the rest of the world, not a chance. Avoid like the plague.
