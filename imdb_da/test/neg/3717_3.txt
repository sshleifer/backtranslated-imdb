The film has strange annoying characters, strange inexplicable slapsticks and an insurmountable amount of dialogue on smoking. The film has a distinct plot of a bitchy, empty-headed woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) seeking love. Although anyone ever liked Jeanne's character, personality or reading the dialogue, I really can't say it. Except she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker provides an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look beautiful and soulful (as he smokes). And what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she's not really in it enough for someone to care about her. (But she likes smoking). <br /> <br /> This is a waste of some time. I don't even know how to sit through as much of the movie as I did. I can't even think I spent time writing this, except to warn others about their banality. Someone needs a cigarette?
