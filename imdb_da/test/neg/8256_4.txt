I bought this movie when I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that the play is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and sometimes morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spits on a particular scene in her Hotel room is utterly pointless nonsense. Ms. Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here, but in the end I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Ms. Rubins Character is first innocent, so sexy as she plays Stephen Baldwin's Character (Travis) for a fool. The support model includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his more famous namesake) and M.Emmet Walsh, who has appeared in many films. I also noticed Art Evans, who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The Movie is decent and there are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but it's certainly not a quick move or intelligent thriller. There is a particular scene when they are in the car, to commit a crime, and Stephen Balwin's characters wear sunglasses, and when you see him again, the area around his eyes is etc. Instead, the sunglasses come back later when they leave the crime scene and the police are in pursuit, a very obvious mistake in editing. <br /> <br /> If you are fans of one of the ladies or either Baldwin, then you can find something to suffer here, but others need to remove it. This is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really more than a few dollars if you want it.
