I had heard about this movie through a friend, it should be a thriller, but what I didn't see was a "thriller". It was more like a weak attempt at one. Amber Smith was a bright place - it can give her too much credit. The scenes she was in bed with actress Erika Michels were also paralyzed. The two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all. Amber Smith was far out of this crazy league and it certainly appeared on the camera. She didn't even think of these scenes. I was disappointed because a friend of my guy had, of course, pumped this movie up to be something "amazing" but it was actually more like watching dime big porn.
