Bad news for anyone who wants to film a full-length parody of a lifetime network movie - the creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done so, albeit inadvertently. All the life-time troops are there - a divorced mother in danger from a fake stalker, an unreliable former man (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married) and a police authority that patronizes her complaints and forces her to stand up for herself . Especially jaw is the scene where the heroine, after maintaining a burglary and attempting to murder his mother from her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve the stress of shopping! After seeing firsthand harassment of a colleague by some creep, she met in the church, I know stalking is not a joke, but it is determined in this movie.
