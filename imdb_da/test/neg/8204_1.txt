This distinction should go to HARROW'S DUNGEON. At least Ed Wood's flawed attempts to make a quality science fiction movie had the dubious "star force" of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell, and Lyle Talbot. HARROW DUNGEON has no redeeming capabilities at all. What could have been an interesting and exciting plot about a marooned aristocrat on a ghost colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is the waste of the heavy dialogue and monotonous action of amateurs whose lines sink like weights in a sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects" that took place in one's bathtub further judge this movie for the dung pile. Even the treatment of leprosy is something of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy cannot be raised from a person in his last phases illustrates the plot line contracted by the fallist fallon and his lady Cassandra and ends up as the original occupants of the castle De Sade, sentenced to insane and inhuman atrocity. It is interesting to note that not a member of the player made another movie. No wonder talent begins talent; Lack of talent begins oblivion, which is where this movie should find its regrettable end.
