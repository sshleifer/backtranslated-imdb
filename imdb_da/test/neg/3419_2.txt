If you want a horrible interpretation of "MacBeth" then this is your answer. Filled with archaic Shakespearic English language in an Australian style from the 21st century, this movie lives in disappointment and leaves you scratching your head. But that's not all. <br /> <br /> Not only are there sophomoric action sequences, but there are plenty of scenes where the female body appears. The witches played by actresses reminiscent of schoolgirls more than witches put on a soft porn screen with MacBeth in an incredible view of love. Welcome to stupidity and depravity - all at the same time. <br /> <br /> It's strange why this project was green-lit. So much for modern cheesy film. "D"
