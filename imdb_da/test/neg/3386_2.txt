Heard some good remarks about this movie as being very gory and scary, but neither is it. Of course, the screenwriter wanted to make a scary horror movie, but at the same time inject some teenage comedies for the young audience. Scares and comedies rarely result in good films, as does MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not really fun or scary or too enjoyable at any other level. <br /> <br /> Aproaching 39 years of age I've seen my share of horror movies. I've seen good and terrible ones, but the crops of movies released these days are so scary mediocre that it bears me seeing them. The acceptance of these bad movies these days is what really annoys me. Let's see, they produced a lot of nap in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but they were also considered as such. Today, they are considered "good entertainment". - Bollocks!
