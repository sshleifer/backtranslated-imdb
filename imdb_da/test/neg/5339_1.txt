I've seen many Asian horror movies lately, but this one has to be the worst so far. It started interestingly enough, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The added "drama" scenes, flashback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started all the killings if it wasn't the ghost? What would she return to her ????? No response at all! All in all, it's not very scary, and the filmmakers have to come up with much better ideas than this ... A positive was the sweet actress, but it's about it. <br /> Not recommended.
