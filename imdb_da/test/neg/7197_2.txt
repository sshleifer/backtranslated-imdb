Savage Guns (video title) is a dirt cheap, the bottom of the spaghetti vest, where the survivors of a massacre hunt the bandits who killed his brother and left him dead and caught them in a city run by their crooked boss. <br /> <br /> Despite lots of violence, you are able to be both boring and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> Leader actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with a tree and uncharismatic performance that doesn't generate any warmth or sympathy at all. In other words, the viewer does not really throw him in, despite being the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings heavily and terribly unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
