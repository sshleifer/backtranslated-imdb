To sum it up in a nutshell, this movie was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes. The act was sub-par, the only decent actors of the pile were Trisha, the killer and Molly. The music was a little lame but adequate and the special effects were much too over-used. The story / manuscript was bad, the unnecessary torture / romantic scenes were relieved for too long and a disappointing end. <br /> <br /> The movie's start was pretty slow, the fake look not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house and it was a prerequisite for a good story. <br /> <br /> Trisha began receiving the threatening phone calls, which increased the excitement. This instantaneous excitement, the best feature of the movie began to build, but then the friends drove the place and destroyed any tension / horror in the movie. The plot then becomes blunt from now on. Chemistry sparks between the two couples, and then the killer knocks Frank and the other girl. This scene was drawn on and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The murderer then makes his way to Trisha and ties her up. There is an exaggerated torture scene that continues for at least ten minutes too long. What is done badly is not at all entertaining, and it drills more than shock. In summary, the first thirty minutes of this movie sounds promising but so poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruin this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
