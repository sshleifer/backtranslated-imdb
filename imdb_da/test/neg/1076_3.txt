The signs were so unoriginal it hurt. The little, slim dorky computer geek, the funny African American with stupid clisch√© punchlines, cool white guy with compassion for cars and the beautiful leader who ends up with the beautiful girl. The actors are at best mediocre. Eccept from Norton that does a good job as the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. It's all about a group of pampered boys who use the world as their playground, where every security in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table. I mean, why work to live when you can rob people? <br /> <br /> AND, .. Who f **** is messed with traffic lights in a big European city?!? And in the middle of the FRIGGIN day!? Think of all the injuries and not to say deaths among innocent civilians. What about all ambulances and lighthouses? <br /> <br /> I didn't create compassion for the protagonists, and the weather, Mr Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I couldn't give less speed.
