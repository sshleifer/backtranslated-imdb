This movie probably seemed like a good idea in the pre-production. "Let's make a movie about one of the biggest and most controversial athletic coaches in the modern era! And let's throw Brian Dennehey as Coach Bobby Knight!" This is where this movie went horribly wrong. Why throw an actor who has no fate of the man he portrays? And why let this actor make his character not Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? When I watched this movie on ESPN, I didn't believe that this man was actually the Coach Knight. He didn't look like him, spoke like him, act like him or even go as he did. I couldn't get past this fact, and so I couldn't enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as criminals Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, it didn't matter if they were precise historical models of their true characters, because most of us had never heard of these men before we saw the movie. But with someone as visible in today's media as the Coach Knight, you need to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Nixon, it was the same situation. But Anthony Hopkins made us think he was actually Nixon. Dennehey didn't even try. What could have been a great movie was smothered by this. In addition to the fact that this movie attempted to make the four letter word what "Saving Private Ryan" did for dismemberment, it stumped. Too little of the real Coach Knight and too much profanity for shock value made this movie a "season to quit halfway through the broadcast." The only good thing about this is that it was TV movie. I didn't have to waste my hard earned money on this piece of waste.
