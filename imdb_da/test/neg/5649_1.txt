What more can I add? This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible play, a bad script, slow slow pace - even visible microphones trembling from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can't be bothered. I saw this for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will to stay became too big for me. I can only assume that the first set of comments and voices was from people associated with promoting this insult to British filmmaking. And worst of all, I had to buy Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason the DVD has not been redistributed as a coaster is that it is now proud of in my top 10 worst movies ever collection . <br /> <br /> Absolutely one to be avoided.
