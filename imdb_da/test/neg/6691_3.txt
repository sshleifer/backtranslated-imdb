Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There have been so many films that have the same plot, and this is just a bad reconstruction. Popular white girl moves to ethnic school, does not fit in, is soon accepted. Originality is nonexistent in this, nor is it the laughs. It uses so many old badly executed jokes, it's annoying. I don't know why they think it's a good idea to make video clips for mediocre movies, but it's not. Having said that, positive in this is that all people in it are quite competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * Out of ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
