Terrible, stupid inanfilm dealing with corruption in Louisiana Purchase Timber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inappropriate. A member of the college's English department can only sign his name with an X. When it seems that a straight laced senator (Victor Moore) comes to the state to investigate, anyone trying to blame innocent but stupid Bob Hope character. Is it weird that Vera Zorina did not get part of Maria in the 1943 "For whom the mountain taxis?" Of course, corrupt officials along with Hope are trying to show pictures of Zorina with Moore to destroy him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant he had offended when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was sorry was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent of humor this absolute mess in a movie. When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he makes a start of James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." If so, the movie is too far away for some good answer. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics are both horrible. The song that praised Louisiana, sung in different ways, is absolutely horrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music in this horrible movie?
