Should I have expected anything but crooked from Carrot Top? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. It's by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Chairman" did not add humor to my attitude, but it scared me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I was furious that this man is making movies.
