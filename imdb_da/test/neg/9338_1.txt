In short, this movie was horrible. I understand it's a Disney movie that is generally superficial with mediocre plots and bad acting. But I have to say that this is the worst of all Disney movies with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS (my god) and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old there is no way I would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been worse is if they tried to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a service and change channel before seeing this, no matter how bored you are on a Sunday afternoon.
