This is the bottom of the barrel type of B-movie from one of the poverty radio studies, Monogram, in the mid-40s, the kind that filled in a double bill. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw was to see what JACKIE MORAN was as a leading role as a sidekick at a radio station trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Meade at once with the win only two years earlier, and it was one of his last teens roles. He's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as harmless as the production values ​​and is full of cliché-based situations with a casting of uniformly untouched people. WANDA McKAY is the blackboard girl "discovered" by a radio producer, and SIDNEY MILLER is the hero's nerd friend who is afraid of her own shadow. It is amazing for an hour when the murder is resolved after a cleanup of all the suspects. Terribly overstated, the only silent achievement of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust for too short appearance. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but everyone is forgettable, just like lame jokes and dialogue.
