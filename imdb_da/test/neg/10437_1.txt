Have you ever read a book, watched the movie and wondered - how did they turn up so badly? This is one of them. The book from Huffaker, "Nobody Like a Drunken Indian" was amazing, scary fun ... this movie is not. It looks as if nobody cared enough to move the direction together, so we were worried about the signs. This film, which touches upon some real concerns about the Indians, makes you doubt why we haven't seen more comedies about the Holocaust or slavery. Not well done.
