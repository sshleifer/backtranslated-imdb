Cover cover and the prerequisite for writing are so promising. As a slasher maniac, I expect a lot from this. But what the heck is going on. The movie is horrible. The direction, plot, tension and action of the molds is so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home camera to shoot it. Lucky that it still manages to deliver some good moments to me that makes me like it. Thanks for the bad package of so-called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
