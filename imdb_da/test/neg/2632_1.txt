This movie sucked sooo badly, I couldn't even see the end. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he was saying, as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also where did he get all these wedding dresses off; it was very inconvenient. The film failed to deepen Milos drowning and how it made people ridiculous. Jeter and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I couldn't give this movie a zero rating because by classifying this movie as one, I felt I was giving it undeserved praise.
