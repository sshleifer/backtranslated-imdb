An hour ago I had finished seeing this my friend. As fans of Dragonball, we think this movie is so bad that it is good. We will say one thing: without a sixpack beer, there is now way you can survive through this movie. This movie is to be seen with a number of Dragonball fans laughing at their ass. The best character in the movie is the gentleman Horn, his makeup, his grin and behavior throws the unforgettable experience. What we liked about this movie was the fact that the island of Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character that resembles that of the comic is Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too.
