How can anyone give this something higher than a '1'? I thought "Manos, Hands of Fate" would always be the worst movie ever to affect my optical nerve. In fact, I didn't think anything could be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxy" is the rare film where every single element is painfully, agonizing, dazzlingly bad. How often have you seen a movie and commented, "Who the hell did this thing?" From lighting to audio tracks to effects to script to appear in filmography for. . . Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely endless. It's so bad I couldn't even tell if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to be ridiculous. I would previously eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again.
