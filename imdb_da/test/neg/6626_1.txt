Is this a bad movie? Don't take my word for it. Consider the following press reports from people who tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> · While watching this movie, Harold Fabers from Sandusky, Ohio, shot his brain from his skull to over 200km / h and walked prior to scrubbing over the floor, NOOOO NOOO screamed NOOOO. <br /> <br /> · Mrs Louise Robbins from Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired homemaker, committed ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie. · Janine Hosmer from Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie, even though she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Franciso, California, spontaneously exploded with such force that Mr. Wells left tibia later was found embedded in the wall of a house in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who do not suffer more severe effects such as those described above, at least 75% became incurable, violent and understandably insane after seeing this movie. Of the remaining 25%, most had already been crazy before watching the movie; the rest was either blind and / or deaf or persistent vegetative. I do not say, do not rent if you want. I just report what was in the papers.
