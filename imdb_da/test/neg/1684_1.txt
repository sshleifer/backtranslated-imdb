This is probably the most annoying show I've ever seen in my life. It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I've ever seen. Everything about it is just bad. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Different situations come up every week for parents to handle their children. I couldn't understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place, not to mention several seasons. Scripture is bad, very bad ?? It contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in ranked R or NC-17 films. Especially for the young boy character, where everything he does is pleasuring himself, is that what is called family show humor? Castings are also terrible, for all you see is a real BAD Actor period. <br /> <br /> Final Word: This Show is a real torture !! This show gives a picture of how irresponsible a parent can be (using power incorrectly instead of understanding). It's zillion times away from reality. Listen to Kenny G would be a god transmitter compares to this. If you see a washing machine around, it won't hurt your eyes as much as this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The show is so bad Even the mother of the cast pulls her daughter out of the show.
