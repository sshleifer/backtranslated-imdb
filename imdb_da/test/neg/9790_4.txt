This is an odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is full of sexual innuendos. The whole premise is pretty absurd, not just the idea that some dead heads of three dead children are doing some crime fighting, but the same thing says the kids are taking a gang of hard older guys, are a little removed, but then the parents are mostly absent movie, and authority figures are missing to keep the kids in line. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, but Meg Foster plays a very battalion-like leader with the beautiful AJ Damato as head of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well cast as the young lovers, but for a comic actress for her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted in this movie. Overall, the movie is unusual, but I don't think it's enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution. The landscape is all pretty boring and the "special effects" are quite bleak. Put this one out unless you are in the mood.
