I saw Bogard when it was released in the 70s. It was one of the images that got an X rating for violence. We snuck into our local grindhouse and saw it anyway. Really good picture. Lots of blood from the street struggling, although the cheap sound effects for the battles took something away from it. And lots of sex. I remember one of the early scenes when Bogard meets this beautiful brunette in an apartment she shows him. Without saying a word, he picks her up, puts her on the window sill and nails her. From what I remember, it sailed from that point. So when I found out, Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if it was the same picture.
