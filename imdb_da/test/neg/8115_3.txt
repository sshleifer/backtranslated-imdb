Although this is terribly dated, I have to insist ... PLEASE, DO NOT ACCEPT! Frankly, it just won't help, as there is nothing that can be added or changed, at present, to make this cinematic better. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it is based was atmospheric, well-written, really spooky work, but on film, it just didn't translate. Most of the king's written masterpieces have to be translated into movies. I'm not sure why this is, but when you see this work, you'll probably just see what I mean if you see it. <br /> <br /> Book? It is wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> It ranks a 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
