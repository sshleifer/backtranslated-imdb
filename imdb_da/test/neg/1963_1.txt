Okay, we start at the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the shrinking office that blasts out random rhythms about Jack Frost. Oh, okay, my brother shouts '' Turn it off! ''. Anyway, back to the crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The shrink has its speakerphone on and lets its secretary and her friends listen to this heroic insane sheriff. I suppose he should be the hero of the first movie, but he looks nothing like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people dig the anti-lush snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some kind of medical staff. I can't quite see how this should do anything but their poking anti-freeze / Evil killer mutant snowman with needles, warming it up, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, all nine yards. Nothing. Okay, they give up and leave it in an aquarium. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on top of the tank. Guards go in, clean things, encounter the fish tank and the coffee wastes the tank, which makes Jack alive. <br /> <br /> See the power of power! Now he is in. I think the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii. But it couldn't be Hawaii! Unless they spent their entire budget on dang flights. Bah .. I don't wanna ruin the rest of this rat movie so you'll have to rent it and see it for yourself ... Am ... I don't suggest to do it though ... Sheesh ..
