I just saw this at a local independent station in the New York City area. The cast showed promise, but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And probably it was just as bad every single time as pointless and stupid as any George Cosmoto movie I ever saw. He is like a stupid man Michael Bey - with all that terrible conviction. <br /> <br /> There is no point on the conspiracy, no burning issues that encourage colleagues. We are left to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti to different walls in the film to the next. Thus, the current budgetary crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnant wages and the middle class death are all undermined by the sheer graffiti terror. /> A real, amazing idiotic movie.
