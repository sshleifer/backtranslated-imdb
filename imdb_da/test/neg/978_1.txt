I saw "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was in it after enjoying him in the "Poirot" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth seeing, so I entered the movie with the expectation that it was a potentially worthy movie. Unfortunately it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I will not bother criticism of notions, pacing, cinematography or any other structural aspect of the movie; Others here have already given their opinions on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message, as it proclaims in the intro that it is based on a true story, and the supposed meaning of the film is related. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Voyage" focuses primarily on a poor black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the United States because he thinks he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - his motivation is completely selfish. (Of course, some people will prevaricate by saying he did it for his family, but in fact he decided to bring children to the income he could make in Ghana so he really just created his own problem.) For this purpose, Kingsley decides to break away aboard a Russian freight carrier tied to New York. In doing so, he is faced with harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But this is exactly where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Why should the audience be expected to like Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal? Goals are not such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal to steal from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the United States, it would mean taking out a system he hasn't put in. And if he gets caught, the company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that any of stowaways cares about what their chosen approach costs anyone else; They are definitely just out for their own gain. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he won in the lottery at the start of the movie, for legal passage to the United States, and applied for a residence permit and work permit. Instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route. So since Kingsley's journey is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we worry about him or his trial? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged over the challenge of the Russian shipping company coming to New York without stowaways? Because he is black and the company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to fight for Kingsley as if he is a hero of a noble journey. But when you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission are not noble at all, you can't really worry about him. Before anyone plays the running card, I assure you that I wanted I felt the same, no matter what ethnicity / nationality the parties involved were. Imagine if a British person decided to stow in a train heading for Bhutan, sneak across the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiques to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very small, I would bet. So why should we feel different to Kingley? Because he's black? Because he is poor by US standards? The film authorities are knocking on us to share their views that the ends justify the funds, and that a shipping company who fined $ 45,000 is inconsistent with the way in which an unskilled worker earns a little more in the US than he could have if he had just stayed in his own homeland. I didn't buy it for a moment.
