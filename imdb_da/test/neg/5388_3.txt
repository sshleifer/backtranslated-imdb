This movie can be great, but it is a complete ripoff of Bill Forsythes comfort and joy. C&J is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen without becoming diabetic. It's ok if you like it, but realize that EVERYTHING in this movie is a direct rip-off. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost everything at supply - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I'd rather rent something tonight. Local Has a Young Peter Capaldi, and an Old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has made up for filmmaking after some really crappy Hollywood treatment. Sad.
