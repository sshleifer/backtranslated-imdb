Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery, and while they cleanse a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious creature, Skeleton Man. Then, a military battle led by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) seeks two groups of four soldiers each who disappeared in the jungle. They face Skeleton Man, shoot him while killing every soldier. Then the skeleton man goes to a power plant, and Captain Leary explodes the plant that destroys the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought "Skeleton Man" on DVD and expect to see a fun waste, but I found a very boring boring, annoying and pointless crap, with shots and explosions. The pristine history is completely interrupted and makes no sense, and the military team is composed of imbeciles and insists on shooting the supernatural skeleton until they are completely slaughtered. Their leader is also the most stupid, with the flare of a whole facility eventually to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the alien warrior Predator. On DVD it is possible to use the fast forward button along the film and reduce the viewer's suffering. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
