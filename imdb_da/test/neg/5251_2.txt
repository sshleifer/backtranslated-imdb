What. Uh ... This movie is so dissociative and destroyed that I literally lost a bit of my beauty after it was over. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to put my finger on what's exactly so crazy about it ... It's not just the hilarious techno music or "out of time" medieval / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander setting or strange CGI " Lashes "sample resembling a man made of animated sausages, or even the" Grendel's mother "sample, resembling an Alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she was too long in the tanning. All these things are weird, but what's really the weirdest thing about this movie is the actor. I simply can't explain. Of course, this script is hell stupid, but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all. Lambert is always weird, and usually he is boring, but for one he has entered Dolph Lundgrin territory: I can't help but just start laughing every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie some credit to be completely scatter-brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I will always take a bizarre disaster in a movie over a very mediocre. Warning: If you plan to see Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours then walking in the streets in some kind of nightmare, hyperactive-catatonic dance. It is true. When I finished my Beowulf spirit journey, I woke up in the midst of the Siberian tundra in a blood blood and milk. There was a dead wolf lying next to me and I later found that I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf was sitting on a rapidly constructed stone hall nearby, enclosed with light and flowering flowers. The tape told me to go. I got up and I went.
