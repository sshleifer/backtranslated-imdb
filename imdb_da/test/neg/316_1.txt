Warning may contain spoilers <br /> <br /> I just used to use 5 bucks on this movie on Amazon, and I wish I never used it. I have never seen sucking terrible special influences or trades. I mean Jack-0 is just a ridiculous monster and his costume looks like something you could buy at a Halloween store or do yourself. The play is just awful, especially Sean Kelly, I mean, came on, he's so pathetic with his little lines "I'll get me PUmpkinman" I laugh so hard this is just stupid. I think the movie is so horrible that they had to put a few minutes naked in it, just for people who didn't shut it down. I think the most ridiculous scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife into the toaster and gets electrocuted. I think it looked so fake and dumb I could buy it at any Halloween store or do it myself. Well I do not recommend watching this cheesy movie because it will be time you never come back.
