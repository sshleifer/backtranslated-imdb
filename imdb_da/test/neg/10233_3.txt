I think my summary says it all. This MTV ish response to the classic Candid Camera TV show has a Gen X (or is the Gen Y) type that puts false choppers in and wearing different hats and wigs and glasses, and sets people up in rather scary, but often Not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invites his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is the bride, finished in a full wedding dress and long pearl. "Joke" is that the parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims he no longer has his "pieces". The problem is that this sktick goes far too long, of course to fill the time. And Kennedy is as fun as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candidate camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this, driving around and constantly asking, "Do I look great?" I recognize the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who believe that JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank goodness the show was short-lived.
