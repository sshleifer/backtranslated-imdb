In other words, I can't remember a more trivial, insane and superficial movie, in other words, a real chick flick of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they can not admit, they made a mistake. It seems to sum up the worst of female hopes. No real fabric for it all happy and low. Yes, it pleases the masses. Well not this member of the masses. What a trivial burden of driveline. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. And thinking I paid Â£ 7 to see this! I think this, however, represents the dumbing down of the cinema as with most media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what?
