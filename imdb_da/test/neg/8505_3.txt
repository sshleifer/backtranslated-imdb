I enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters are not stereotypically homosexuals, and that is what attracted me to this movie, it and the main actor, the only reason I give this movie a star more than it deserves (Although it's not because of his performance in the movie, let me tell you that). Many people complain about the cinematography, but the camcorder's sense of the movie added some "underground" quality to it for me, and there are a few scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would blush any movie screen. <br /> <br /> But the play is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I came through the last half of the movie and listened to a soundtrack from another movie). You have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialogue and then it is awkward and amateur. The subject of the graffiti could have made this movie fantastic if it had been gracefully exploited and the art itself had been more exciting, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, there is no climax; There wasn't really a plot to begin with. The movie just jams back in the style of the styles and dies. A forgettable movie.
