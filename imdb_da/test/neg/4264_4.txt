This film did not give Mr Bachchan justice. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed with the movie and there wasn't much plot to it. Matter a fact, it's the first movie I've ever been disappointed with him in it. It starts with her coming to her home with her daughter, and he's a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden if she has lowered herself. He is a three-year-old man who has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl. The movie makes no sense. The whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and the daughter finds out. I just didn't think this movie was up to Bachchan's standards. He's better than this movie. I've always depicted him as an upright person and so I watched him in this movie and I couldn't see him in this movie. The film did not keep my interest at all. I couldn't wait until the movie was over. And you also don't want to.
