OK, we got JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck from, Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty good based on the reviews, and it started out quite high on my movie scale, but halfway through it was just pulling out as long as I kept losing interest. I was actually boring, probably because you can see immediately what should happen in the end; the story is actually pretty wireless, i skipped 15 minutes and didn't miss anything! This movie should have been a short work, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour max. It starts well and ends well, too badly the filling is boring, boring, boring and lacks everything but time. Some people say they like it for the music; I don't care about jazz, and I don't watch movies for their scores, I go to the story, and when it is pulled out ... well, classes fall into my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good open, large dense, dull filler. The story was cool, but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way, you haven't seen too many thrillers.
