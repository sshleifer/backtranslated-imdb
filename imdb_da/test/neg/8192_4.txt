It's schmaltzy, but what more did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with evil mother, sister and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an inefficient putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villain. <br /> <br /> Cast, set and wardrobe were all very attractive and I thought the actors did a fantastic job considering how weak the material was. The film was beautifully filmed and boasted with a soundtrack carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should experience all the time. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the movie some of his best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you will love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you will love this movie. I did not. I was able to sit through it, but it was close.
