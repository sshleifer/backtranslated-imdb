This film has the feel of a college project over what wants to make a blair witch project so theme. But it does not succeed. The kinematics are poor and it is even more so. The characters, in my opinion, do not come out as being credible at all. The movie's editing doesn't work right either. There are many bad effects that I think are put in there to try to add a horrid effect. But for me, it gives me a sense of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie freak who likes to watch "different" and indie horror movies. But I think this movie is not worth seeing for the average person. You will not benefit from the bad effects and the hand-held feeling this movie gives to its viewers.
