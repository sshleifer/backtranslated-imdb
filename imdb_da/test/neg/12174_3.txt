I'm totally amazed at how over-rated "Cemetery Man" is among horror fans! Now I usually bid on movies that mix two or more kinds of genre styles into one, and I love almost any zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult classic did not show me much to be pumped about ... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery nurse and his retarded male child, Curly Joe, sees the assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the newly deceased, who pop out of the ground seven days after their first death. He meets with a widow, who he "wows" with a gruesome graveyard environment and develops a quick romance that soon has sex with her on the grave of his dead man. Man's body is alive and biting her and triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie. "Cemetery Man" tries to incorporate any element it can, such as horror, romance, comedy, action, and failure in the long run. It stretches together and can never focus on any aspect that is long enough to make it interesting to the viewer, for example. The paunchy sidekick's relation to a live cut head, a motorcycle riding zombie launch out of the ground, the protagonist decides to gun down random people on the pavement, etc.. This thing is so horrified and boring that it is almost impossible to take it seriously. Sure, it's stylish and often "elegant", but even the most "artistic" kind of movies need the right kind of lineage to make sense. "Cemetery" plods and does not seem to focus on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very tiring after a while. People claim that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". Honestly, when it comes to zombies, I don't want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There is a bit of gore and nudity - mostly in the scenes where it will play "horror movie" but not so much to do up for it is uncompromising lack of structure. Horrible movie.
