Apart from DA (James Eckhouse) and a short prominent woman who is convincingly sympathetic to Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger) situation, Ellen herself is the only compelling character - and similar character in the film. She is the one, not her dying mother, who must be and is - the only true thing. it is not only in the role, in Zellweger's play, but also in the plot itself ... Until the plot turns to itself - and makes the mother the "true thing" in the eyes of her weak will, low man who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer sees, but such intelligent perceptions must make room for the low-key feeling of the man exhausted in both his wife and daughter's realities. <br /> <br /> To start, the only powerful scene in this movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is the lie at the end. Ellen is just another young strong woman to be bitched in accordance with a crybaby father. A very flawless movie - so flawless that it is called a bore and not worth the time.
