Please give this one a miss. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast averse horrific notions. The show is flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Michael Madison could have allowed this on his plate. He almost seemed to know that this wouldn't work out, and his performance was pretty unclear, so all your Madison fans give this a miss.
