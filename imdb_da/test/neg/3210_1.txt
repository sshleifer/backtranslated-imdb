Now this is a real turkey by the overrated director Franco who gave us such classics as "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be fun. I offer the hilarious howlers of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., But this one turned out to be too much for me. It's the first movie I rated 1. Where do I start? The play is idiotic to the extreme. The dialogue is incredibly poor. The management seems to be non-existent. The best music cue (used repeatedly in this movie) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it is to live! Bad Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In a shot, Sanders reads a Popeye cartoon while his hands torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that confused me was that Franco immediately showed female nudity when I thought the movie would win it - it's really leading skill! Still, I'm afraid that a movie where actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile.
