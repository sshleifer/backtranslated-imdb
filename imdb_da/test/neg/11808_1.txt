The video box for 'Joyride' says "Starring second generation superstars", and you can't help but be sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith has gone on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the throw? So, being the pathetic attention grabber on the box, I was stupid enough to buy the movie for a dollar thinking, I'd be in the countries "so bad-the-good 70's movie" Eh, not so much. While so many speechless 70s youth films (or regular ol '70s movie for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful,' Joyride 'didn't even try. It's just futile. It is without any interest whatsoever. Each character is so poorly conceived that it is no wonder that these actors look so spotless. In a nutshell, the movie is about three 20-somethings going to Alaska to start a business, but instead being robbed and then having to find work. They are picked up, eating dog food, stealing cars, banks banks. It is all very typical, but in addition it is done in the most common way. There are no surprises, and the power is so bad, and the actions of the characters are so ambiguous that you can miss out on more scenes and not at all. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's tits - then it's a must-see. It is still not enough to get this over the lowest rating I can give. Best line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * out of ****
