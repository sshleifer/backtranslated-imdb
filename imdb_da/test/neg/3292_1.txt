How can things like this still be done? Don't have Seinfeld, Arrested Development, Office etc. Killed this old-fashioned creepy crap? Apparently not ... I'm actually quite a fan of Michael Rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but in this he sucks, but someone will struggle with this script. <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys it. But she's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you'd understand why she'd think so much fun. <br /> <br /> Just to demonstrate how predictably the show is and to prove a point with her, I guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments / lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word! I felt very obvious. This annoyed my wife as she hates it when I do it (can understand why, but I felt good so screw it!)
