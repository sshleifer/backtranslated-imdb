Let's not break ourselves, this cruelty is not plan nine or cat women. It's bad, period! The performances range from the drama school's theatrical (Marla English) to a 'not indifferent' walk through (Tom Conway). The photograph (even in a good print) is so scary, it is occasionally difficult to see what happens. The real problem, however, is the meaningless, meaningless, almost plot less story and the guided, paceless direction. In a lively 77 minutes, it still feels endless. <br /> <br /> The play is especially unfortunate. There are two story lines that only intersect at the end of the image. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race using voodoo and modern science (though there is little science as evidence) that he can control telepathically. He keeps his wife imprisoned (for no apparent reason). Meanwhile, a few treasure hunters and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village where he works, in anticipation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for her experiments. She's turned into a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And returns to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, trying to pick it up and falling into the water and apparently drown. The white hunter saves the wife. In the last shot we see the supposed drowned woman emerging as the monster again; threatens a successor (now it's really a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> AIP producer, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a lecture on the DVD, trusts to spot the teenage niche market and satisfy it with brilliant low-cost movies. But it is hard to see how anyone could think that this rancid concoction would satisfy any kind of audience. What appeal might they have? The monster looks so rare that it could hardly be called a horror movie. Jungle action is lukewarm and boring. There are no teens in it and no signs that teens could be expected to identify with. <br /> <br /> Producers delayed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. This is a trick and Arkoff was ashamed of his affiliation with it.
