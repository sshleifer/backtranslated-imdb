Imagine if you want: four teenagers have a job of staying in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check if there are paranormal. If you see this in the dark and late at night; You may want to get the hair on the back of your neck to rise a few times. Otherwise, this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What should be dialogue is very lame and the actors are nice enough to look, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something really scary happens. This movie is great for 'sleeping over' when you have both eyes hardly open and everyone is yakin 'and snackin'.
