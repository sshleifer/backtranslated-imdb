Now, at least, we must admit that the big Hollywood horror producers are finally getting smarter and more understanding. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights to Asian horror hits and subsequently re-introducing them into America, they now discovered that they could simply hire Asian executives and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the States. It's like killing two birds with a stone; way to go guys! The "messengers" are virtually identical to any other supernatural chiller that came from Oriental countries ever since "Ringu". Roughly translated, it means that it is a boring, long-lasting and completely gorefree movie, but it has many amounts of false scare and embarrassingly weak "did we scare you yet?" moments. Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) has previously made the highly overrated "The Eye" and it is a tradition for them to build a story of tracks and hints to a point where it is almost impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audience. But they don't seem to be eager to change their formula sometime soon. And they are also conscientious enough to reuse the same old and repeated ghost items over and over again. Remnant spirits from the former inhabitants trapped in a remote farm's walls? The protagonist separated by untreated trauma from the past, so they must first restore faith and trust each other? Give me a break! Throw a videotape and a seven-day curse, why don't you? Even the attempt to make you jump in your seat is too déjà-vu and will not scare anyone over the age of 7. Slamming doors, dirty and gradually growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, noise from the basement. . The endless use of cheap tricks like this is almost insulting to horror fans. "Messengers" is about a family on their way to a new life in the country as sunflower producers. The family situation is a little dysfunctional, as a personal tragedy (which is not revealed until late in the film) has caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents distrust their rebellious teenage daughter. Shortly after, the children experience strange preferences in remote farms, but they are unable to convince their parents to leave. It's basically the whole movie. Little Ben sees things, but he can't speak, and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural forces, but no one listens to her. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very much derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", but it lacks the constantly unpleasant atmosphere and disturbing tone. The scripture goes far too seriously, although it is quite easy to predict the final decommissioning, and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least the "Eye" delivered some real shock in the end, while the happy joy of joy ending in "The Messengers" is just pathetic. The only positive things I can think of are the beautiful landscaping sites, the appropriate editing job, and the promising young actors (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is a creepy, but unfortunately underdeveloped, supportive role for William B. Davis.
