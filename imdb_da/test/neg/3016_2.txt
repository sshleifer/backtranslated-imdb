It is too bad that these guys, the so-called judges, are such jerks, even the nominally "sensitive" ones. It is the self-explanatory tone that really makes me sick myself; These guys have no perspective on their behavior. However, I think the real problem is the quality of the participants. Not a single smooth or really charming one in the party. They choose the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because they are the only ones these guys have a chance with. Let's see some real players trying for a really unattainable girl and maybe you have a show. Otherwise you have a rebellious half hour of self-love. And genuine sexual tension takes two.
