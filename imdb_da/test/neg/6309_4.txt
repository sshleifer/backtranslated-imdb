Just rediscovered this night and put it bluntly: "Style instead of substance". We can already guess that there would be a lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what is depicted here. Jerry Lee Lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real man in one minute throughout the hour and a half plus maturity, but then again, all the other characters are just a pencil stroke from being total cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club, and we see Jerry getting his inspiration. Maybe be possible. We see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee, who plays the piano like an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it is exciting and a little scary. Cut to a scene where he first meets his other cousin, Myra. From that time on, it all becomes a summary of certain events played out in a style that fits a high-speed news roll. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie isn't a bit entertaining and it's good to hear new versions of the songs that Jerry Lee did. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his major successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most famous character in the movie. She teases, she spins, she chews gum and plays coquettish, and it's about it. There is never a moment given a reason why she ended up being the third wife of Lewis and talking about wives, where are the first two? That is why this really cannot be classified as a biopic, but more of an inaccurate news roll. We see Jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to No. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable downfall. Absolutely no reason in reality. <br /> <br /> To conclude another minor quarrel: The movie runs from '56 to '58, and still says Myra: "I'm only 13" right up to the end.
