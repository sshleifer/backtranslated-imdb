If I could judge it a zero I would come from someone who likes shock / exploitation movies of the time and Waters overall I have to say this is useless. It does nothing, serves nothing, an idiot with a camera and a desire to prove its wisdom by resisting social standards is all this comes out as. It is totally amateur, both in principle and in execution, it has no point, its digestion for guilt for obnoxious, obscene with a neanderthal, it is useless. Anyone said that Waters probably "chuckled" over all the bad press and reluctance others gave with this movie, but why? If I made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a step for ten minutes, it would probably receive the same accomidations, but why would I be proud or chuckle on it? <br /> <br /> Would it be because I am so relentless that I have to resort to this, so I can say "HA! Take that censor and mainstream! I'm so rebellious, do what I want and film it! " No. Waters should not be proud of this mess, fans of waters should not see it, it is useless, that is, without use. It doesn't. t even fit the criteria of art for art sake. To suffer or defend this film is to defend something that was designed with the intention of being anti-culture being pushed to the general public in modern terms this movie is the hot topic of the movie. <br /> <br /> Inoperable and outdated. A Poser movie that requires it is recognized as rebellion.
