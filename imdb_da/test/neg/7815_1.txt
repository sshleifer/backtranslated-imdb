This is by far the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. My advice is, don't see it. This does not even classify as a movie. <br /> <br /> You'd be better off sitting on the sofa rather than watching this movie. The action was horrible, but what was the worst by far was the story. Very unlikely order of events that are not even fun. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very stupid choice of Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to shop in this movie. I could even disturb their career a little. <br /> <br /> When I entered Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I'm sorry about that. <br /> <br /> When you're 10 or 20 minutes in the movie, you could basically predict what would happen. I hoped it would be better, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating this. The movie is horrible. Don't look at it. Hope this helps.
