The fact that this movie is good merchantable quality is a shame, but back in the 1940s it was the only type of movie made for theaters that were organized for Black audiences due to segregation. So while MGM, Warner and all the other major studies made extremely polished films, small studios with shoestring budgets were left to confuse what they had. And from watching this movie, it is obvious that much energy went into making the film, even though it is a lovely miserable movie aesthetically. Some of the actors were not very good (especially the French guy), the sets were minimal and the plot was silly, but the movie also had good music - from different styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues. This is thanks to many talented but rather unrecognized black artists. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the plot, it was quite silly and silly, but still tough in a kitschy way. I loved watching Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from AMOS 'N ANDY TV show) in a row when he made the absolute ugliest woman in movie history (this includes the Bride of Frankenstein and many others) - this is probably due to the fact that when he Not in a row, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. If the man pretends to be a woman who is actually as distant as a woman, I doubt that this movie would also work. Seeing this ugly and rubber-visited man with a cheesy bead still in demand by three riders was quite fun. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but from a historical point of view, the fascinating and outstanding view of young adults is knowing what America was like for black in this era. A very interesting and fun time capsule.
