Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "The Grissom Gang", a recast of 1948's British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish", has kidnapped 1920's heir Kim Darby by a pack of lumpy thieves; soon the gang is shipped and bad Kim is then transferred to the coupling of another curly bunch - triple gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in a row. Initially, Darby (not very nice and not so smart) tries to escape this boring bread, but they are on her. Eventually she just gives up trying and there are problems with the story. Should we in the audience be sympathetic to her? Is her growing concern that the family crescent should be heartwarming? These are disgusting, chalky characters, and I would like to see as little of them as possible. But since the side stories (cops progress on the case and another involving floozy singer Connie Stevens) are pretty boring, the director has no choice but to continue to build the sweaty faces on us. Almost soon, nervous Darby begins to sweat even though her stage up in hayloft is sensitively done, and Aldrich's climactic moments are thought-provoking if they are disorganized. ** from ****
