A plot that is stupid beyond belief. But that being said, it must be admitted that the main players go on their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And that's how it should be. It's not their fault, the author seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats off to what is really a very clever performance by Joanna Kerns. She proves that just because it is not on the side does not mean that a role cannot be seized and buried. And she does it with gusto. It's good for her. <br /> <br /> Dito to Christine Elise, who is encouraged to be a little more than confused and untouched, but goes far beyond what is asked of her at the script. <br /> <br /> And to the Grant Show too. A candidate of daytime and first class soaps (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and undervalued. His primary drawback seems to be his impossible to ignore good looks. He is a solid, well-founded actor who is capable of much more than he generally has the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is basically window dressing. <br /> <br /> The direction is sufficient and the manuscript I pointed out is pretty idiotic. See this to enjoy three great actors in the leaders who are delighted to perform some needed chewing scenes. It is fun.
