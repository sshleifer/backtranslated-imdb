This was the second MST3K'd movie I have ever seen, and still has a place in my heart as one of the most hilarious horrible movie experiences you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is in this, using his chiseled physics to score another payment on the mortgage at his condo. He is stiff, wood and unconvincing, but he still comes across as a sweet, sympathetic guy, and at least he's photogenic. That's the only decent thing I can say about the movie, so I thought I'd get it out of the way right in front. That he is in the film adds another point to the score and saves it from being "1 in 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order are examples of how poorly composed this movie: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, Tanya Roberts clone (Mila) quests to the "ends of the earth" Finding Ator, who takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time she spends, stumbles around dying of a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which I suppose would have slowed her down completely.) So Ator heals her and takes her faithful help Thong and sets out to go back to her castle ... and continue to take the next 50+ minutes of the movie and restore the earth as Mila traversed in 3 minutes. How does it work? I know the effortless crew is harassed by magic forces and enemies, etc. on the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently, the author / director felt the need to add "depth" to the movie by adding a continuous debate / Socratic dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zor (the average St. John's wax wannabe) and the wise m and Akronas (Richard Harris wannabe). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards, T-shirts and bumper, and he doesn't understand pace, pacing or timing ... nor the actors. (Crow's remark during one of these exchanges is the tagline for my post). The scenes with these two draws on and off, bringing the movie to a fragile stop and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword fighting and the quest for the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) When Ator arrives at the Castle (and is taken), it goes even further downhill. Zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims with Ator and Mila to the worm God he holds in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the dramas of people waiting for the line at the DMV to pay their traffic fines. Ator continues to have a big blow with the snake, which is almost unconvincing than Bela Lugos battle with the rubber patch in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene at which Ator invades the wing and animal skin hanger is so incredibly stupid that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and causes you to roll on the floor, laughing until your sides hurts. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh yeah, and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of a nuclear explosion at the end with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the "atomic nucleus" McGuffin driving the movie because mankind was 'not clear'. ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMES IN !!!") Like "The Bride of the Monster" again, came to think of it. All it needed was a bystander to observe, "they manipulated in God's domain." 6) For some reason the version of the movie showed initial and closed homo erotic credit sequences that have absolutely nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this recording came from, but it is actually worse than the actual movie it bookends. <br /> <br /> See this only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you enjoy the way MST3K spikes material like this.
