I feel stupid after seeing the first 20 minutes, luckily I went out and saved the rest of my brain, people had to see better movies and note why they are highly rated, not because of the film's budget or the special effects, just good acting and getting simple things right, and most importantly - not LAME -, but I suppose this was produced for the Sheeple without taste and not a clue as to what is '' A good movie '' afraid of rating films make Save your undervalued high scores for '' once in a life time movies ''. Remember that many use IMDb for confidence in reviews and statements, do not spoil the broth with sugar coating turks peace and love
