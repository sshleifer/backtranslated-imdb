Let me say this about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work, which I wish more people had. If we all had the optimism and future hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. Being aware of Ed Wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994) several times, I admire his boldness and his efforts at the job he loved; I still admire his never-say-die attitude. He had a love to rule that I would have wanted more people in modern Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't make his movie more fun to watch. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most confessional film, is probably his worst. "Glen or Glenda" is a deadly cult movie about a cross-dresser named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood himself) who, despite his love for his fianc√© Barbara (Dolores Fuller), cannot win her desire for transvestitism, where he dress in women's clothes and a wig and thus become ... Glenda! Glen / Glenda's story is told by a doctor and he is also talked and watched by a mysterious character called "The Scientist" played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there is also a lot of evidence on an Alan / Anne character that becomes transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story, which this film is originally called "I changed my sex!" was previously based. <br /> <br /> Have I dropped your jaw yet? Well, as much as I will warn you from this picture, if you have never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is no lie in the plot synopsis I just gave you. Everything in it is true. This is a film about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that doesn't sound very appealing at first and is not done in a very appealing way. I am sure that with a good manuscript and a good director (it had neither), "Glen or Glenda", despite the subject, could have been a very moving picture. It's a confessional movie on Wood's side as he was a real life transvestite as well as on the screen. But once again it doesn't make a good movie ... or a clear one for that matter. "Glen or Glenda" is an uneven, disorganized mess on a movie that sinks into new trenches in the sphere of poor cinema. It doesn't make more sense than its infamous stupid scene where Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the string!" of unexplained recordings of stamped bison. Most of the film is told in a monotonous voice reminiscent of some very short short informative movies I've seen before. It is like one of the really bad short films extended to a seventy-minute function and twice as boring. We sit there forever and wait for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to build energy yourself, with the camera locked in a position for many terrible minutes and long times when nothing happens at all. The only moments worth any time are those of Bela Lugosi who are able to bring some light into these dark trenches. I think Lugosi should be like the film's divinity, but personally I couldn't care less for who or what he was supposed to be. I want to tell you what he was: A gifted actor launching waste. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked to work with each other so well for him. <br /> <br /> I always want to admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema, but I will never like as long as I admire his movie. A film critic once called Ed Wood's movie "innocent fun," but I find it even doubtful. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No, sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Mount Everest in the biographical world, then "Glen or Glenda" is surely Mariana Trench.
