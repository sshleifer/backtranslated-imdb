CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American at birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently dolphins in Australia for 35 years, all with different reinvented cameras, which he either straps on his back, table or boats. In the mid-1970s, he joined the Surf Mag editor and budding film producer David Elfick to create this visually interesting story about this life and photography. 75 minute function CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70's, the audience was a bit confused by this movie, neither the surfer movie nor the surf film, because George swims on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard .... it offsets George's dull drone (sometimes so dry or drop, that it was actually fun .. that almost set fire to or fell over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' stream slipping through a wave that ran for 23 minutes, all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ image and usually became a hit: as the "Opera House Tickets" cost far more than a movie, the audience was entangled to watch this movie as an excuse to have been to the Sydney Opera House '... so the film took business as a low budget attraction for locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show "there". This created this myth that the movie was a great crowd puller and reputation spread. As a result, it became together with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through Britain and Europe as a dual feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70's, and the audience was pretty much upset about it all. Recently, George has returned to the Lord of the Flies style with another well-photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE, which gives viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins in Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min card with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' card. Each was met with a collective gab of both the media and the shame in January 2005. .... all of which make CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you should have been there' all those years ago. But on a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year, people came up .... but then 2000 comes up every night to see something in this summer season of movies ..... so the damn thing escaped one another box office binge. How many have really had it is very open to debate. Again, they were more than likely just confused by this crazy movie with an amazing reputation. Elfick has, however, since 1975 gone on a star career as a major producer and director of many boasting Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and current applause on his performance. George is still floating out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.
