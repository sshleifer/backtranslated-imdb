This film gives a cinematic example of the word worthless. It's terrible you can forget about plot or decent acting because it's not there. And with the dismissal of any decent story or action or even the pull of being mildly scary, there is usually only one plus back to a horror movie. The appeal to those who like soft core porn. This movie doesn't even have that. The women show little skin, but not really more than say the Xena show. Apart from the main star, who is not particularly attractive and has a few poor and I mean bad sex scenes. So in short, if you like good movies, you have no interest in this movie. If you fancy cheese, you still have no reason to rent this movie. If you like erotic and soft core pornography, you really have no motive to rent this movie, and most importantly, if you value your time at least, you can't do better than avoid this movie.
