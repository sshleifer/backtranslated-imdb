"Mame" is a disgrace to many things - to Lucille Ball, to a story that has been told better many times and to the musical genre altogether. Mrs Ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be very reassured. Bea Arthur is good, but that's not enough. The production is very shoddy and inexpensive appearance, the songs are underpair and almost every joke misfires. Also, Lucy couldn't dance well, so the music had to be lowered to a funeral pace. Avoid at all costs, but see the lovely "Aunt Mame."
