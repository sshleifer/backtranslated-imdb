... Brian? What the hell were you * at * when you signed in to do this? <br /> <br /> I saw this recently at a festival and it was greeted with howling laughter all the way through. As the credits rolled, tears plunged into the face of many of the audiences. <br /> <br /> The reason is a lumpy message about 'E.R.' and 'The X-Files'; as cynically aimed at the television audience as it is possible to come without being sued. The sequences involving the abductions are hilarious - both Yuzna's 'floating from bed' and 'Screaming Mad George's pathetic plastic aliens' accounted for unbelieving, deterrent laughter. <br /> <br /> Limp, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it was a deviation - just as terrible as 'Return of the Living Dead 3' was good. <br /> <br /> Steev
