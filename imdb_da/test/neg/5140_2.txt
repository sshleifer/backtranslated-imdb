Like the previous poster, I'm from Northern Vermont and I was inclined to like this movie. But not since "Red Zone Cuba" I have seen such a confusing plot. The things that the people are building up make no sense. Two of the band across the border send another party across in a car. Uh, why? Then the other two meet and drive up at night to the shadow of the evil guy in a luxury Packard. - Couldn't two people in a flatbed car make more sense? Then parked outside the garage, which holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! When they watch in the morning and start pulling whiskey, they are, of course, mocked and shot at and lose some of their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the smugglers put whiskey in a boat and float it across the border. Again, why? I am told by someone whose great uncle really smuggled in the area. All that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could go beyond the United States Canada Border Patrol, which then had a fraction of the resources it now has. <br /> <br /> Don't let me get started in the last half hour, which didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma over the years.
