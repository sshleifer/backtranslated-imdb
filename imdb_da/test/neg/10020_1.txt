Of course, most of the 1980's slasher films were not worthy of the celluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced. <Br /> <br /> Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know, they are being killed one by one by a <br /> <br /> mysterious alien. Climaxet has a hunky forest ranger trying to <br /> <br /> get to teens in time before the last cute girl gets buzzard. <br /> <br /> My least-favored B movie guy, John Carl Buechler, made the miserable <br /> <br /> makeup effects here. Casting features Carel Struycken, "The <br /> <br /> Witches of Eastwick" and Addams Family Films. Unfortunately, he does not discover <br /> <br /> up to the very end of the movie and is covered in <br /> <br /> burning makeup, making him unknown. Steve Bond (someone <br /> <br /> remembers him?) Is here in an early role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction and manuscript he cowrote, both smell <br /> <br /> presenting brown bears in the forest. He pads the movie with so much stock wilderness footage, I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of <br /> <br /> the set sits around the campfire and eats, so go and eat again <br /> <br /> again. Forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever laid in a slasher movie: he tells a joke about a wide mouth seed to a baby deer. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that he once worked <br /> <br /> with the legends in silent cinema, has two scenes and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher movie: he and <br / > <br /> hunky forest ranger has a cucumber conversation and <br /> <br /> cream cheese spreads on oatmeal bread ... yes. <br /> <br /> There is no moment of excitement here. The killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> Survivors are looking for a buddy, seeing the students from behind <br /> <br /> trees. We know it's the killer, because the filmmakers have a heartbeat sound effect that helps wake up <br /> <br /> the viewer every few minutes. Skip this pile of lighthouse juice and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween" instead. <br /> <br /> This is characterized (R) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore, <br /> <br /> A bit of beauty, short female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual <br /> < br /> references and drug abuse.
