This was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. The action was god horrible, the story was too bad. It was a good idea though. If this movie would have had better movies and much better actors, I might have something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just ruined it. why do people always kill good stories by making bad movies. The only good part was when the killer put his head under the floor with a tape that was pretty good. The swinging ax was just awful, there was absolutely no excitement. And even when the killer chases everyone around in the end, he went from one place to another in seconds, it makes no sense.
