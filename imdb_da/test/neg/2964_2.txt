My wife and I both remembered this movie is much better than it is. When we rented the last weekend, we wondered if we saw the same movie we had seen 22 years ago. We both agreed that we probably remembered the TV series, which in its 1-hour segments was forced to actually pack up plot lines. This film leaves many loose threads, as has been mentioned by others here ... pretty much every storyline's storyline is undissolved. <br /> <br /> Maybe the title song resembles.
