This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to see this kind of thing, turn to Hollywood movies! This is totally a shame for the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki sucked seriously! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it seems that the functioning genes jumped over a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less, and Uday Chopra was of course just picked up because he was the director's pampered son. (All that Halla Re was incredibly stupid) The songs are eh and I hope the director hasn't spent too much money on it ...... I supported the movie. Don't let your kids see it and if you have it in your house it's a stupid movie, then discard it! Buy the CD if you need to. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than the movie.
