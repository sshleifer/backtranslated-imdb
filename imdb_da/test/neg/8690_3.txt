I rented this movie after hearing Chris Gore say something to the effect of "five stars!" on the attack of the show. Well when I turned on the DVD and it showed the 3 phases in hell, I had to buy it. Just to see the play of a mother shouting at her son to pick up her second son in a blazing pit. I didn't expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected at least one summed up version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Unfortunately, there was nothing like that. The 3 phases of the death row occur right from the beginning, and it is largely downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was pretty raw, bar and impartial. Not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this. You would expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not. It would have been nice to have a message or reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, it should have been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. It does not I do not explain these wrestlers' lives either. It shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes, which sounds interesting, but the reality is not as great as it sounds. For example, mother sees her son fighting with light bulbs and tacks, for the first time in a public park. Instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling, they show her to respond to the camera, rather than say an interview later or just to testify to her reactions. Legitimate document wise, this is not. The source material was initially flimsy. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. No conclusion to any of the more interesting stories, no real point or a final thought of backyard crossing, edited together badly, and its and it's essentially a cheap, unsuccessful rip off of Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Wrestling wise, it's pretty boring. The better offenders are at the beginning, and are slowly becoming less amazing and shocking. If you've seen Japanese wrestling, indie wrestling or even Backyard Wrestling DVDs, it won't shock and fear you. If you want wrestling, don't make the same mistake, I did and see this. Instead of some CZW ECW or XPW DVDs. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be. Not in support of suicide or dangerous stunts, but their justification for committing these acts. The rear feathers seem stupid for wrestling. Most of them are unemployed and probably have problems in their heads, and wrestling is a kind of therapy for them. But the followers seem even more idiotic. Mothers generally take the whole "if you can't beat them with them" to cope with the fact that their sons basically kill themselves. School authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because it is an alternative to walking with gangs and to a lesser extent making drugs, which is a bit of fun as this segment took place in a rural town where as humans live 20 miles apart. People are stupid. That's what I picked up from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the thoughts and thoughts of someone who is brutalizing in wrestling, and basically what the back of this DVD law is, you get UNSCARRED: Nick Mondo's life. It is more amazing and interesting than the backyard and much more entertaining. Oh and that's actually good.
