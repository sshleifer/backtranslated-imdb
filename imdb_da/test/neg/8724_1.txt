This is "Battlefield Earth" in the mini series. With a few exceptions, it has all the catastrophic ingredients that condemned that film and will follow it to the tomb of the turkey cemetery. They are both adaptations of books with an infinite number of pages that have been transformed into a complete root by a screenwriter and director (in this case they are the same person.) Which clearly does not know what they are doing, they both have a messiah wannabe that doesn't really deliver like a hero (The game in this case of a guy who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the power is not with him.) And a bunch of stupid boys who like to betray and destroy life for each other , they contain both scenes stolen from better productions, and they are both cheap productions trying to look expensive with some (often poorly made) computer animations. The exceptions that actually make it worse are the awful work that the light source has, which does not even have the ability to light the light in its own room, the camera seems to have no reason to tilt "Battlefield Earth" state, but mostly flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and to small desert set that contains only a pile of sand on the front of a background painted as a desert, which becomes very old very quickly because it appears from almost all scenes and the bad idea from costume designer trying to imitate "The Fiveth Elements" fashion frenzy with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. Silly moments to remember: 1. Every scene with the guild's guys, similar to MST3K's observer, but with stupid hats. 2. The Irulan shows up at the party dressed in his butterfly dress (Why butterflys? -Was it filled with parrots in the cleaning?) With matching silly hat along with a few guys with stupid balloon hats. 3. Paul stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming "I, m alive". 5. Each scene with the background, because the newer fits the foreground. 6. Every scene with Fremen's false religious cermonies, especially the "life of life" cermony. 7. The battle scene where the same guys are killed a few times, and the same things explode again and again. It's a lot more, but it's a 1000 word limit on this, so I better stop before I get carried away.
