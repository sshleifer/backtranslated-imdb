Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie to be beyond horrible. It was a huge disappointment as it was referred to as one of the eight Horrorfest movies. I can only hope the other seven were better. I was actually embarrassed by the friends I was able to convince to see this, and it's the same friends I did look at The Wicker Man's remake. It has all the clichés in the book. In fact, it went out of its way to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young lady in need, we get three: the only, hot mother with two daughters ?? a thriving, yet mindless, teenager and a sweet but at the same time crazy little girl you just know will have 'special' skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same as in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying, but not so annoying Dakota Fanning. Overall, these characters seemed to be flush with a LifeTime movie. Perhaps I thought horror movies had moved from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark and announce their presence to everyone with ears but not this one. I also find it unthinkable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrary opening day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how untouched I was with these characters, I spent most of the time how cold it should have been on the set, because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were. /> <br /> In spite of all the formal plot machinations, the film does not build any tension whatsoever except to wonder when it will be over. There is more atmosphere on the local jungle in the middle of the most daily afternoons. As for the dialogue, I could have sampled quotes from ten other films and paved together better, more credible discourses. Gore the level, eye candy for a horror fan, was at best minimal. Without their little weapons, the "zombies" were not at all threatening. You could probably fall off a couple of them across the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills it is its banality. Horror movies, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is comical scary or monstrous over the top with gore. I can even take the new ones with their cringe-inducing torture. Every time, I appreciate a really scary, anything but this.
