H.G. Wells spins. No doubt about it. It would really have been a decent sci-fi / adventure movie if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I heard about how this would be the final version of the novel. It resulted in a pathetic and simplistic masturbation. The novel is a great sci-fi story, but how many people miss when reading it (probably because they read it when they are very young) is that it is crowded with social comments. Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that all DECAYS AND DEGENERATES, a satirical jab of Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization lasts forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman. In the short story, Eloi is a 3-foot-big childhood creature with a mental capacity not far above an animal. The time traveler is aware of an Eloi woman, but it is clear that he thinks of her more as a pet, and yet she is killed before the novel ends. <br /> <br /> This movie first attempts to give us a completely stupid backstory about "why he wants to travel through time." The sad romance and the lessons he has to learn are enough to make the film fans vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey into the future is marked by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have been more stroke if we were allowed to see that humanity generally generally degenerates, as in the book. More a reflection of time, I think, when the George Pal version had a nuclear war, takes place. <br /> <br /> The general story? Ugh. A complete misrepresentation of the novel. Eloi is for competent and warlike. Morlocks are too intelligent. UberMorlock is a nuisance and there is no setup. He turns out just in time to be killed. Grazing. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused and in pain. (He signed up with a rib while filming this.) He also looks unhealthy and is too thin as if he had been ill for a long time before he did. <br /> <br /> A sad, sorry movie version of one of the world's classics. H. G. Wells deserves better .... VERY better. <br /> <br />
