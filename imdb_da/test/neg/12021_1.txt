Everyone has their choice for "worst movie they've ever seen." Some like to choose at Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics like Plan 9 from outer space. Ever since I was 14, I have been very vocal in saying that for me the problem is Child 2, and 9 years later I feel the same in the same way. It's not "one of the worst", it's not just an expression. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. How much speed, pooping, peeing and puking can you put in a single movie? I don't have to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist! Why is it so hard on this filth? I have nothing against bathroom or gross humor. Heck, I like the American Pie movies. Having such a profit within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the right tip is to do it with children! Having small children call each other sexual names (IMDb won't even let me write this word here, but here it comes out of the mouth of 8-year-olds. Think about the irony of it!) And urinate and brush on everybody else just do everything that seems snapper. The worst line in the movie: "I think I'll fire in several people's offices." <br /> <br /> What other movie has: urination in lemonade, dynamite bars, exploding toilets, a little boy playing his babysitter and having sex and projecting it to the side of the house, and a little girl who is funny about scratch testicles? <br /> <br /> But my absolute favorite moment must be when the same little girl is on a carnival ring, saying, "I'm going to brush up" opening your mouth and fake looking brushing straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle! The Puking scene in Scary Movie 2 looked more real than that. <br /> <br /> I suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried. You get the impression that he didn't even have a script, but was just his usual self. Too bad he must act silly while pizza is thrown at him. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking of the movie so much has just made me go to the toilet. Goodbye!
