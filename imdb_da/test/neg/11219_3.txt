Although the movie was just so, the closed caption was by far the best I have ever seen! Most of the time the spelling is awful and the caption out of sync. I use the closed caption, although I can hear well, but find many actors mumbling. Also, many times the soundtrack exceeds the dialogue. Thanks!
