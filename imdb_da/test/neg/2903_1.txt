You can only describe this with a word and it would be WOW !!! Wow, I really didn't think any shit like this could be released. If you see a movie titled Ninja, do you expect to see at least some cool martial arts, right? But none of these guys know any martial arts at all, and it looks like they went to China and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that is the level of their martial arts skills! The actors are too big, the special effects are ridiculous, and there is no plot that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty!
