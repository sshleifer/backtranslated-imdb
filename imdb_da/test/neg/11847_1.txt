This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some kind of extra bad movie. It even fails this, as there is too much "plot" and not nearly enough yummy puppets and ridiculous things. Seriously, the dolls are cute, and the boys in suits crack me pretty well. The performances are at best c-grade and lame throughout, with special props for the Spec-Ops guy who spoke a kind of bizarre east coast / venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really worry about what he says because only the cursed words are different. Cinematographically, it is not offensive, pretty much what one expects from low rental car direct to video waste (like the script). The fact that New Concorde's recordings from the "Carnosaur" films are offensive and quite confusing. To shame, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite horrible movies and they have somehow turned it up and made it nigh unwatchable. See the "Carnosaur" movies to see shoestring dinosaur chaos. <br /> <br /> I give it a star because I'm so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.
