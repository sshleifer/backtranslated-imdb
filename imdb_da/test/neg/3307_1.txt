OK, so she doesn't have a caller ID. When you get stalked, you get it! And no cell phone? When you become stalked, you get one if you are one of the few full-time working parents who are the head of the household who does not already own one. This mother gets a big NULL in the parenting department. So her mother is in the hospital and she decides that a shopping trip will help her out. Just a silly movie. Glad I have Tivo and a FF button on the remote. And what's with my 10-line, I just don't have much to say about such a bad movie. I might ask why she holds opening packages that she has no idea who they are from. The son didn't add much to the movie either. The police were also a big ol zero. Now come to the nearest Verizon and get the darn mobile phone. @@
