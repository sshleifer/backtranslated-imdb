The last sentence of this review is a great spoiler. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed Joe Dante's work since Piranha. He has made a large number of different genre items that were both fun and honest. <br /> <br /> But it's pure crap. This is the kind of satire - in line with Thanks for smoking - it is so literal and direct that it does not leave anything a) to laugh at and b) to let the audience think about. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the plot and material are so rich, timely, and mature for intelligent comment. By the way, there is absolutely no reason for the protagonist to shoot the Ann Coulter character at the end of the movie. It's just ridiculous, ridiculous.
