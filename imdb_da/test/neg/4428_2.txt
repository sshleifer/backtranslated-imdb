Director Lo Wei was known for reading the race books and losing his set - telling us something about his "approach to film making, huh? The reviews I've read fall into two categories: 1) this is a movie so bad it is fun, or 2) this is a movie so bad, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Let's get to the point we all agree on - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2. The story is almost incomprehensibly complex and it is further torn and twisted by the remarkably bad camera work and editing, but Lo Wei was so in love with that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it if we want to or not. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lo Wei was sad the day (or two) this movie was made - he just wanted to make everybody suffer, throw, crew and audience. > <br /> Give yourself the pain.
