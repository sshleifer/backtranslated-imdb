In the fall (2001) I took a film class taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect the scene of the film and his winner of an Oscar in some unclear categories seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When one of his classes mentioned that he had just finished controlling a movie called "Full Ride" and was in the post-production phase, my interest was piqued. But that would be the last thing I would ever hear about that movie project. Until last week ... Last week I saw in a TV list that "Full Ride" should appear on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can't help linking WB with tea splash shows like Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS was the fact that Full Ride should be released directly to TV not too flattering in itself. But nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to see the creation of my former film teacher. After two hours passed, and the final credits started rolling, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB quality show that stretched in the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed like this movie was made with the only intention to show only on the WB network. The criticism of this movie will be largely a criticism of a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are superficial, the story is clich√© in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely constructed, and the character development is forced and incredible. This movie just screams 'unoriginal'. The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) playing solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance on a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Of course, he obviously agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not exempt from his peers because of his poor team spirit and poor attitude. <br /> <br /> Then the love of interest comes. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). In fact, she is a sympathetic character, unlike the equally abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost welcome her when she first rejects him. But of course it comes inevitable. She falls for him, changes her attitude to everything, and everything works well and happily. But now it's time for conflict! <br /> <br /> Earlier in the film, Amy made it clear to Matt that she would not score with him because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. This is very much for Matt's dismay, and his soccer comrades (yes, they eventually warm up to him), betting him he wouldn't get anything. But of course Matt comes to accept these terms and decides he is not about nookie. Here is where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to destroy this surprise, then skip ahead. <br /> <br /> [BEGIN SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt finds out some local guys who apparently Amy Lear are always trying to score with a guy every year from the all-star team, so she can try to use him to escape her small city life to work in a cafeteria (which is enchanting at first) and turn it into the big city. Suddenly realized he had been used, and that his love was a shame, Matt tempted it to return to a crime scene and leave the football camp before "the big game". Amy tries to reassure him that she really was in love this time, but he's too cold to buy it. So what should Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and be a versatile jerk? I will not destroy the super-ultra-surprising end for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So if I somehow got you pumped up to this movie, you're ready to realize it was my sarcasm and not real enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues 'or` Summer Catch'. And that doesn't say much. There is hardly any comedy to save it, and the characters are too shallow to worry about. So what have you left? Little. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the movie was how much of an unflattering image Hoeger painted by Nebraska through this movie. It seems that he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is far too stereotypical and shallow. The characters 'great hopes of doing in the `big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only cements the stereotype of Nebraska's are a lot of hicks living in the farm community. I am unsure whether Hoeger's intentions were good at trying to focus his homeland, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as the backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into Full Ride and then becomes rooted in his awareness of where he shoots that he ends up wiping out superficial garbage that seems to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that. <br /> All in all, I am totally disappointed with Hoeger's first big movie, and I hope the next time he can combine his knowledge with a little originality to create something different and thought-provoking.
